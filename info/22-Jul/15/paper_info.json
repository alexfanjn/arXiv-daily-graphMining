    "title": "Changepoint Detection for Real-Time Spectrum Sharing Radar",
    "abstract": "Radar must adapt to changing environments, and we propose changepoint detection as a method to do so. In the world of increasingly congested radio frequencies, radars must adapt to avoid interference. Many radar systems employ the prediction action cycle to proactively determine transmission mode while spectrum sharing. This method constructs and implements a model of the environment to predict unused frequencies, and then transmits in this predicted availability. For these selection strategies, performance is directly reliant on the quality of the underlying environmental models. In order to keep up with a changing environment, these models can employ changepoint detection. Changepoint detection is the identification of sudden changes, or changepoints, in the distribution from which data is drawn. This information allows the models to discard \"garbage\" data from a previous distribution, which has no relation to the current state of the environment. In this work, bayesian online changepoint detection (BOCD) is applied to the sense and predict algorithm to increase the accuracy of its models and improve its performance. In the context of spectrum sharing, these changepoints represent interferers leaving and entering the spectral environment. The addition of changepoint detection allows for dynamic and robust spectrum sharing even as interference patterns change dramatically. BOCD is especially advantageous because it enables online changepoint detection, allowing models to be updated continuously as data are collected. This strategy can also be applied to many other predictive algorithms that create models in a changing environment. ",

    "title": "Modeling Long-term Dependencies and Short-term Correlations in Patient  Journey Data with Temporal Attention Networks for Health Prediction",
    "abstract": "Building models for health prediction based on Electronic Health Records (EHR) has become an active research area. EHR patient journey data consists of patient time-ordered clinical events/visits from patients. Most existing studies focus on modeling long-term dependencies between visits, without explicitly taking short-term correlations between consecutive visits into account, where irregular time intervals, incorporated as auxiliary information, are fed into health prediction models to capture latent progressive patterns of patient journeys. We present a novel deep neural network with four modules to take into account the contributions of various variables for health prediction: i) the Stacked Attention module strengthens the deep semantics in clinical events within each patient journey and generates visit embeddings, ii) the Short-Term Temporal Attention module models short-term correlations between consecutive visit embeddings while capturing the impact of time intervals within those visit embeddings, iii) the Long-Term Temporal Attention module models long-term dependencies between visit embeddings while capturing the impact of time intervals within those visit embeddings, iv) and finally, the Coupled Attention module adaptively aggregates the outputs of Short-Term Temporal Attention and Long-Term Temporal Attention modules to make health predictions. Experimental results on MIMIC-III demonstrate superior predictive accuracy of our model compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, as well as the interpretability and robustness of this approach. Furthermore, we found that modeling short-term correlations contributes to local priors generation, leading to improved predictive modeling of patient journeys. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel approach for semi-supervised learning (SSL) designed to overcome distribution shifts between training and real-world data arising in the keyword spotting (KWS) task. Shifts from training data distribution are a key challenge for real-world KWS tasks: when a new model is deployed on device, the gating of the accepted data undergoes a shift in distribution, making the problem of timely updates via subsequent deployments hard. Despite the shift, we assume that the marginal distributions on labels do not change. We utilize a modified teacher/student training framework, where labeled training data is augmented with unlabeled data. Note that the teacher does not have access to the new distribution as well. To train effectively with a mix of human and teacher labeled data, we develop a teacher labeling strategy based on confidence heuristics to reduce entropy on the label distribution from the teacher model; the data is then sampled to match the marginal distribution on the labels. Large scale experimental results show that a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on far-field audio, and evaluated on far-field audio drawn from a different distribution, obtains a 14.3% relative improvement in false discovery rate (FDR) at equal false reject rate (FRR), while yielding a 5% improvement in FDR under no distribution shift. Under a more severe distribution shift from far-field to near-field audio with a smaller fully connected network (FCN) our approach achieves a 52% relative improvement in FDR at equal FRR, while yielding a 20% relative improvement in FDR on the original distribution.

    "abstract": "Moving Object Detection (MOD) is a fundamental step for many computer vision applications. MOD becomes very challenging when a video sequence captured from a static or moving camera suffers from the challenges: camouflage, shadow, dynamic backgrounds, and lighting variations, to name a few. Deep learning methods have been successfully applied to address MOD with competitive performance. However, in order to handle the overfitting problem, deep learning methods require a large amount of labeled data which is a laborious task as exhaustive annotations are always not available. Moreover, some MOD deep learning methods show performance degradation in the presence of unseen video sequences because the testing and training splits of the same sequences are involved during the network learning process. In this work, we pose the problem of MOD as a node classification problem using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNNs). Our algorithm, dubbed as GraphMOD-Net, encompasses instance segmentation, background initialization, feature extraction, and graph construction. GraphMOD-Net is tested on unseen videos and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised learning in several challenges of the Change Detection 2014 (CDNet2014) and UCSD background subtraction datasets.

This problem has important applications in molecule design and drug discovery, where the reward is naturally invariant to graph permutations. The key challenges in this setting are scaling to large domains, and to graphs with many nodes. We resolve these challenges by embedding the permutation invariance into our model. In particular, we show that graph neural networks (GNNs) can be used to estimate the reward function, assuming it resides in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space of a permutation-invariant additive kernel. By establishing a novel connection between such kernels and the graph neural tangent kernel (GNTK), we introduce the first GNN confidence bound and use it to design a phased-elimination algorithm with sublinear regret. Our regret bound depends on the GNTK's maximum information gain, which we also provide a bound for. While the reward function depends on all $N$ node features, our guarantees are independent of the number of graph nodes $N$. Empirically, our approach exhibits competitive performance and scales well on graph-structured domains. ",

Our method makes use of dependency graphs to show internal interactions between threads and system resources. With these graphs, one can pinpoint where performance issues occur. However, a single trace can be composed of a large number of requests, each generating one graph. To automate the task of identifying outliers within the dataset, we use machine learning density-based models and statistical calculations such as -score. Our evaluation shows an accuracy greater than 97 % on outlier detection, making them appropriate for in-production servers and industry-level use cases. ",

However, robustness remains to be an ill-defined concept without solid theoretical support. In this work, we introduce the Lipschitz continuity, a well-defined functional property, as the rigorous criteria to define the model robustness for BNN. We then propose to retain the Lipschitz continuity as a regularization term to improve the model robustness. Particularly, while the popular Lipschitz-involved regularization methods often collapse in BNN due to its extreme sparsity, we design the Retention Matrices to approximate spectral norms of the targeted weight matrices, which can be deployed as the approximation for the Lipschitz constant of BNNs without the exact Lipschitz constant computation (NP-hard). Our experiments prove that our BNN-specific regularization method can effectively strengthen the robustness of BNN (testified on ImageNet-C), achieving state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR and ImageNet.

This leads to complex model designs due to proposal generation and/or per-proposal action instance evaluation and the resultant high computational cost. In this work, for the first time, we propose a proposal-free Temporal Action detection model with Global Segmentation mask (TAGS). Our core idea is to learn a global segmentation mask of each action instance jointly at the full video length. The TAGS model differs significantly from the conventional proposal-based methods by focusing on global temporal representation learning to directly detect local start and end points of action instances without proposals. Further, by modeling TAD holistically rather than locally at the individual proposal level, TAGS needs a much simpler model architecture with lower computational cost. Extensive experiments show that despite its simpler design, TAGS outperforms existing TAD methods, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks. Importantly, it is ~ 20x faster to train and ~1.6x more efficient for inference. Our PyTorch implementation of TAGS is available at https://github.com/sauradip/TAGS . ",

    "abstract": "Current object detectors typically have a feature pyramid (FP) module for multi-level feature fusion (MFF) which aims to mitigate the gap between features from different levels and form a comprehensive object representation to achieve better detection performance. However, they usually require heavy cross-level connections or iterative refinement to obtain better MFF result, making them complicated in structure and inefficient in computation. To address these issues, we propose a novel and efficient context modeling mechanism that can help existing FPs deliver better MFF results while reducing the computational costs effectively. In particular, we introduce a novel insight that comprehensive contexts can be decomposed and condensed into two types of representations for higher efficiency. The two representations include a locally concentrated representation and a globally summarized representation, where the former focuses on extracting context cues from nearby areas while the latter extracts key representations of the whole image scene as global context cues. By collecting the condensed contexts, we employ a Transformer decoder to investigate the relations between them and each local feature from the FP and then refine the MFF results accordingly. As a result, we obtain a simple and light-weight Transformer-based Context Condensation (TCC) module, which can boost various FPs and lower their computational costs simultaneously. Extensive experimental results on the challenging MS COCO dataset show that TCC is compatible to four representative FPs and consistently improves their detection accuracy by up to 7.8 % in terms of average precision and reduce their complexities by up to around 20% in terms of GFLOPs, helping them achieve state-of-the-art performance more efficiently.

    "abstract": "Complex networks are common in physics, biology, computer science, and social science. Quantifying the relations between complex networks paves the way for understanding the latent information shared across networks. However, fundamental metrics of relations, such as information divergence, mutual information, Fisher information, and causality, are not well-defined between complex networks. As a compromise, commonly used strategies (e.g., network embedding, matching, and kernel approaches) measure network relations in data-driven ways. These approaches are computation-oriented and inapplicable to analytic derivations in mathematics and physics. To resolve these issues, we present a theory to derive an optimal characterization of network topological properties. Our theory shows that a complex network can be fully represented by a Gaussian Markov random field defined by the discrete Schr\\\"{o}dinger operator, which simultaneously satisfies desired smoothness and maximum entropy properties. Based on this characterization, we can analytically measure diverse relations between networks in terms of topology properties. As illustrations, we primarily show how to define encoding (e.g., information divergence and mutual information), decoding (e.g., Fisher information), and causality (e.g., transfer entropy and Granger causality) between complex networks. We validate our framework on representative complex networks (e.g., evolutionary random network models, protein-protein interaction network, and chemical compound networks), and demonstrate that a series of science and engineering challenges (e.g., network evolution, clustering, and classification) can be tackled from a new perspective.

Existing image-level approaches often focus on single frame and ignore the spatiotemporal cues hidden in deepfake videos, resulting in poor generalization and robustness. The key of a video-level detector is to fully exploit the spatiotemporal inconsistency distributed in local facial regions across different frames in deepfake videos. Inspired by that, this paper proposes a simple yet effective patch-level approach to facilitate deepfake video detection via spatiotemporal dropout transformer. The approach reorganizes each input video into bag of patches that is then fed into a vision transformer to achieve robust representation. Specifically, a spatiotemporal dropout operation is proposed to fully explore patch-level spatiotemporal cues and serve as effective data augmentation to further enhance model's robustness and generalization ability. The operation is flexible and can be easily plugged into existing vision transformers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach against 25 state-of-the-arts with impressive robustness, generalizability, and representation ability. ",

However, the capabilities of tinyML are restricted by strict power and compute constraints. The majority of the contemporary research in tinyML focuses on model compression techniques such as model pruning and quantization to fit ML models on low-end devices. Nevertheless, the improvements in energy consumption and inference time obtained by existing techniques are limited because aggressive compression quickly shrinks model capacity and accuracy. Another approach to improve inference time and/or reduce power while preserving its model capacity is through early-exit networks. These networks place intermediate classifiers along a baseline neural network that facilitate early exit from neural network computation if an intermediate classifier exhibits sufficient confidence in its prediction. Previous work on early-exit networks have focused on large networks, beyond what would typically be used for tinyML applications. In this paper, we discuss the challenges of adding early-exits to state-of-the-art tiny-CNNs and devise an early-exit architecture, T-RECX, that addresses these challenges. In addition, we develop a method to alleviate the effect of network overthinking at the final exit by leveraging the high-level representations learned by the early-exit. We evaluate T-RECX on three CNNs from the MLPerf tiny benchmark suite for image classification, keyword spotting and visual wake word detection tasks. Our results demonstrate that T-RECX improves the accuracy of baseline network and significantly reduces the average inference time of tiny-CNNs. T-RECX achieves 32.58% average reduction in FLOPS in exchange for 1% accuracy across all evaluated models.

    "abstract": "A covert attack method often used by APT organizations is the DNS tunnel, which is used to pass information by constructing C2 networks. And they often use the method of frequently changing domain names and server IP addresses to evade monitoring, which makes it extremely difficult to detect them. However, they carry DNS tunnel information traffic in normal DNS communication, which inevitably brings anomalies in some statistical characteristics of DNS traffic, so that it would provide security personnel with the opportunity to find them. Based on the above considerations, this paper studies the statistical discovery methodology of typical DNS tunnel high-frequency query behavior. Firstly, we analyze the distribution of the DNS domain name length and times and finds that the DNS domain name length and times follow the normal distribution law. Secondly, based on this distribution law, we propose a method for detecting and discovering high-frequency DNS query behaviors of non-single domain names based on the statistical rules of domain name length and frequency and we also give three theorems as theoretical support. Thirdly, we design a sliding window difference scheme based on the above method. Experimental results show that our method has a higher detection rate. At the same time, since our method does not need to construct a data set, it has better practicability in detecting unknown DNS tunnels. This also shows that our detection method based on mathematical models can effectively avoid the dilemma for machine learning methods that must have useful training data sets, and has strong practical significance.

    "abstract": "Modern deep neural networks require a significant amount of computing time and power to train and deploy, which limits their usage on edge devices. Inspired by the iterative weight pruning in the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, we propose DropNet, an iterative pruning method which prunes nodes/filters to reduce network complexity. DropNet iteratively removes nodes/filters with the lowest average post-activation value across all training samples. Empirically, we show that DropNet is robust across diverse scenarios, including MLPs and CNNs using the MNIST, CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets. We show that up to 90% of the nodes/filters can be removed without any significant loss of accuracy. The final pruned network performs well even with reinitialization of the weights and biases. DropNet also has similar accuracy to an oracle which greedily removes nodes/filters one at a time to minimise training loss, highlighting its effectiveness. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose the physics informed adversarial training (PIAT) of neural networks for solving nonlinear differential equations (NDE). It is well-known that the standard training of neural networks results in non-smooth functions. Adversarial training (AT) is an established defense mechanism against adversarial attacks, which could also help in making the solution smooth. AT include augmenting the training mini-batch with a perturbation that makes the network output mismatch the desired output adversarially. Unlike formal AT, which relies only on the training data, here we encode the governing physical laws in the form of nonlinear differential equations using automatic differentiation in the adversarial network architecture. We compare PIAT with PINN to indicate the effectiveness of our method in solving NDEs for up to 10 dimensions. Moreover, we propose weight decay and Gaussian smoothing to demonstrate the PIAT advantages. The code repository is available at https://github.com/rohban-lab/PIAT. ",

    "abstract": "User embeddings (vectorized representations of a user) are essential in recommendation systems. Numerous approaches have been proposed to construct a representation for the user in order to find similar items for retrieval tasks, and they have been proven effective in industrial recommendation systems as well. Recently people have discovered the power of using multiple embeddings to represent a user, with the hope that each embedding represents the user's interest in a certain topic. With multi-interest representation, it's important to model the user's preference over the different topics and how the preference change with time. However, existing approaches either fail to estimate the user's affinity to each interest or unreasonably assume every interest of every user fades with an equal rate with time, thus hurting the recall of candidate retrieval. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Interest Preference (MIP) model, an approach that not only produces multi-interest for users by using the user's sequential engagement more effectively but also automatically learns a set of weights to represent the preference over each embedding so that the candidates can be retrieved from each interest proportionally. Extensive experiments have been done on various industrial-scale datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ",

    "abstract": "Indian vehicle number plates have wide variety in terms of size, font, script and shape. Development of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) solutions is therefore challenging, necessitating a diverse dataset to serve as a collection of examples. However, a comprehensive dataset of Indian scenario is missing, thereby, hampering the progress towards publicly available and reproducible ANPR solutions. Many countries have invested efforts to develop comprehensive ANPR datasets like Chinese City Parking Dataset (CCPD) for China and Application-oriented License Plate (AOLP) dataset for US. In this work, we release an expanding dataset presently consisting of 1.5k images and a scalable and reproducible procedure of enhancing this dataset towards development of ANPR solution for Indian conditions. We have leveraged this dataset to explore an End-to-End (E2E) ANPR architecture for Indian scenario which was originally proposed for Chinese Vehicle number-plate recognition based on the CCPD dataset. As we customized the architecture for our dataset, we came across insights, which we have discussed in this paper. We report the hindrances in direct reusability of the model provided by the authors of CCPD because of the extreme diversity in Indian number plates and differences in distribution with respect to the CCPD dataset. An improvement of 42.86% was observed in LP detection after aligning the characteristics of Indian dataset with Chinese dataset. In this work, we have also compared the performance of the E2E number-plate detection model with YOLOv5 model, pre-trained on COCO dataset and fine-tuned on Indian vehicle images. Given that the number Indian vehicle images used for fine-tuning the detection module and yolov5 were same, we concluded that it is more sample efficient to develop an ANPR solution for Indian conditions based on COCO dataset rather than CCPD dataset.

In this work, we design a novel data augmentation strategy called \"Universal Adaptive Data Augmentation\" (UADA). Different from existing methods, UADA would adaptively update DA's parameters according to the target model's gradient information during training: given a pre-defined set of DA operations, we randomly decide types and magnitudes of DA operations for every data batch during training, and adaptively update DA's parameters along the gradient direction of the loss concerning DA's parameters. In this way, UADA can increase the training loss of the target networks, and the target networks would learn features from harder samples to improve the generalization. Moreover, UADA is very general and can be utilized in numerous tasks, e.g., image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection. Extensive experiments with various models are conducted on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, tiny-ImageNet, Cityscapes, and VOC07+12 to prove the significant performance improvements brought by our proposed adaptive augmentation.

    "abstract": "With video-level labels, weakly supervised temporal action localization (WTAL) applies a localization-by-classification paradigm to detect and classify the action in untrimmed videos. Due to the characteristic of classification, class-specific background snippets are inevitably mis-activated to improve the discriminability of the classifier in WTAL. To alleviate the disturbance of background, existing methods try to enlarge the discrepancy between action and background through modeling background snippets with pseudo-snippet-level annotations, which largely rely on artificial hypotheticals. Distinct from the previous works, we present an adversarial learning strategy to break the limitation of mining pseudo background snippets. Concretely, the background classification loss forces the whole video to be regarded as the background by a background gradient reinforcement strategy, confusing the recognition model. Reversely, the foreground(action) loss guides the model to focus on action snippets under such conditions. As a result, competition between the two classification losses drives the model to boost its ability for action modeling. Simultaneously, a novel temporal enhancement network is designed to facilitate the model to construct temporal relation of affinity snippets based on the proposed strategy, for further improving the performance of action localization. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "The globalization of the Integrated Circuit (IC) supply chain has moved most of the design, fabrication, and testing process from a single trusted entity to various untrusted third-party entities worldwide. The risk of using untrusted third-Party Intellectual Property (3PIP) is the possibility for adversaries to insert malicious modifications known as Hardware Trojans (HTs). These HTs can compromise the integrity, deteriorate the performance, deny the service, and alter the functionality of the design. While numerous HT detection methods have been proposed in the literature, the crucial task of HT localization is overlooked. Moreover, a few existing HT localization methods have several weaknesses: reliance on a golden reference, inability to generalize for all types of HT, lack of scalability, low localization resolution, and manual feature engineering/property definition. To overcome their shortcomings, we propose a novel, golden reference-free HT localization method at the pre-silicon stage by leveraging Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). In this work, we convert the circuit design to its intrinsic data structure, graph and extract the node attributes. Afterward, the graph convolution performs automatic feature extraction for nodes to classify the nodes as Trojan or benign. Our automated approach does not burden the designer with manual code review. It locates the Trojan signals with 99.6% accuracy, 93.1% F1-score, and a false-positive rate below 0.009%. ",

Despite the benefits of reusing established libraries (e.g., time savings, high quality), developers may diverge from the API's intended usage; potentially causing bugs or, more specifically, API misuses. Recent research focuses on developing techniques to automatically detect API misuses, but many suffer from a high false-positive rate. In this article, we improve on this situation by proposing ChaRLI (Change RuLe Inference), a technique for automatically inferring change rules from developers' fixes of API misuses based on API Usage Graphs (AUGs). By subsequently applying graph-distance algorithms, we use change rules to discriminate API misuses from correct usages. This allows developers to reuse others' fixes of an API misuse at other code locations in the same or another project. We evaluated the ability of change rules to detect API misuses based on three datasets and found that the best mean relative precision (i.e., for testable usages) ranges from 77.1 % to 96.1 % while the mean recall ranges from 0.007 % to 17.7 % for individual change rules. These results underpin that ChaRLI and our misuse detection are helpful complements to existing API misuse detectors. ",

In addition, it is difficult to afford long training time and inference time of big models even in high performance servers, as well. As an efficient approach to compress a large deep model (a teacher model) to a compact model (a student model), knowledge distillation emerges as a promising approach to deal with the big models. Existing knowledge distillation methods cannot exploit the elastic available computing resources and correspond to low efficiency. In this paper, we propose an Elastic Deep Learning framework for knowledge Distillation, i.e., EDL-Dist. The advantages of EDL-Dist are three-fold. First, the inference and the training process is separated. Second, elastic available computing resources can be utilized to improve the efficiency. Third, fault-tolerance of the training and inference processes is supported. We take extensive experimentation to show that the throughput of EDL-Dist is up to 3.125 times faster than the baseline method (online knowledge distillation) while the accuracy is similar or higher.

However, higher-order relations in practice contain complex patterns and are often highly irregular. So, it is often challenging to design an HNN that suffices to express those relations while keeping computational efficiency. Inspired by hypergraph diffusion algorithms, this work proposes a new HNN architecture named ED-HNN, which provably represents any continuous equivariant hypergraph diffusion operators that can model a wide range of higher-order relations. ED-HNN can be implemented efficiently by combining star expansions of hypergraphs with standard message passing neural networks. ED-HNN further shows great superiority in processing heterophilic hypergraphs and constructing deep models. We evaluate ED-HNN for node classification on nine real-world hypergraph datasets. ED-HNN uniformly outperforms the best baselines over these nine datasets and achieves more than 2\\%$\\uparrow$ in prediction accuracy over four datasets therein. ",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a systematic and novel mechanism for devising a security attack in the WCN (Wireless Communication Network). The proposed model involves the implementation of the AD (Artificial Dust) by the intruder, followed by the execution of the HD (Half-Duplex) attack. The communication network is based on the deployment of urban and rural scenarios with an unknown CSI (Channel State Information). Depending on the achieved path loss based on the distance of the user from the BS, the user with the highest path loss is particularized for the attack. The formulation of AD divulges the increased susceptibilities of the secure network specifically for the selected legitimate user. The parameter of visibility defines the amount of AD present in the communication channel. Based on the enumerated attenuation created by the artificial dust, the parameter of secrecy rate is evaluated with varying distance of the user from the BS and the operating frequency. Furthermore, the proposed scheme of the HD attack is initiated by the intruder at the specified valid user. The strategy of the attack focuses on the continuous monitor of the uplink and attempts the spoofing attack on the downlink wherein the allocation of the resources takes place. The efficacy of the proposed approach is corroborated through the examination of simulation results. The assessment of the proposed mechanism highlights notable characteristics as compared to the conventional methodology of the FD (Full- Duplex) attack. ",

The importance of automatic detection of threatening and abusive language can not be overestimated.

In this paper, we present two shared tasks of abusive and threatening language detection for the Urdu language which has more than 170 million speakers worldwide. Both are posed as binary classification tasks where participating systems are required to classify tweets in Urdu into two classes, namely: (i) Abusive and Non-Abusive for the first task, and (ii) Threatening and Non-Threatening for the second. We present two manually annotated datasets containing tweets labelled as (i) Abusive and Non-Abusive, and (ii) Threatening and Non-Threatening. The abusive dataset contains 2400 annotated tweets in the train part and 1100 annotated tweets in the test part. The threatening dataset contains 6000 annotated tweets in the train part and 3950 annotated tweets in the test part.

In the context of bag of words visual SLAM, vector quantization (VQ) is considered as the most time-consuming part of the SLAM procedure, which is usually performed in the offline phase of the SLAM algorithm using unsupervised algorithms such as Kmeans++. We have addressed the loop closure detection part of the BoW-based SLAM methods in a self-supervised manner, by integrating an autoencoder for doing vector quantization. This approach can increase the accuracy of large-scale SLAM, where plenty of unlabeled data is available. The main advantage of using a self-supervised is that it can help reducing the amount of labeling. Furthermore, experiments show that autoencoders are far more efficient than semi-supervised methods like graph convolutional neural networks, in terms of speed and memory consumption. We integrated this method into the state of the art long range appearance based visual bag of word SLAM, FABMAP2, also in ORB-SLAM. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of this approach in indoor and outdoor datasets over regular FABMAP2 in all cases, and it achieves higher accuracy in loop closure detection and trajectory generation.

Despite the extensive benchmarks in natural images for dense tasks, such studies are, unfortunately, absent in current works for pathology. Our paper intends to narrow this gap. We first benchmark representative SSL methods for dense prediction tasks in pathology images. Then, we propose concept contrastive learning (ConCL), an SSL framework for dense pre-training. We explore how ConCL performs with concepts provided by different sources and end up with proposing a simple dependency-free concept generating method that does not rely on external segmentation algorithms or saliency detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ConCL over previous state-of-the-art SSL methods across different settings. Along our exploration, we distll several important and intriguing components contributing to the success of dense pre-training for pathology images. We hope this work could provide useful data points and encourage the community to conduct ConCL pre-training for problems of interest. Code is available. ",

    "abstract": "The rising popularity of neural networks (NNs) in recent years and their increasing prevalence in real-world applications have drawn attention to the importance of their verification. While verification is known to be computationally difficult theoretically, many techniques have been proposed for solving it in practice. It has been observed in the literature that by default neural networks rarely satisfy logical constraints that we want to verify. A good course of action is to train the given NN to satisfy said constraint prior to verifying them. This idea is sometimes referred to as continuous verification, referring to the loop between training and verification. Usually training with constraints is implemented by specifying a translation for a given formal logic language into loss functions. These loss functions are then used to train neural networks. Because for training purposes these functions need to be differentiable, these translations are called differentiable logics (DL). This raises several research questions. What kind of differentiable logics are possible? What difference does a specific choice of DL make in the context of continuous verification? What are the desirable criteria for a DL viewed from the point of view of the resulting loss function? In this extended abstract we will discuss and answer these questions. ",

    "abstract": "Expandable networks have demonstrated their advantages in dealing with catastrophic forgetting problem in incremental learning. Considering that different tasks may need different structures, recent methods design dynamic structures adapted to different tasks via sophisticated skills. Their routine is to search expandable structures first and then train on the new tasks, which, however, breaks tasks into multiple training stages, leading to suboptimal or overmuch computational cost. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end trainable adaptively expandable network named E2-AEN, which dynamically generates lightweight structures for new tasks without any accuracy drop in previous tasks. Specifically, the network contains a serial of powerful feature adapters for augmenting the previously learned representations to new tasks, and avoiding task interference. These adapters are controlled via an adaptive gate-based pruning strategy which decides whether the expanded structures can be pruned, making the network structure dynamically changeable according to the complexity of the new tasks. Moreover, we introduce a novel sparsity-activation regularization to encourage the model to learn discriminative features with limited parameters. E2-AEN reduces cost and can be built upon any feed-forward architectures in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on both classification (i.e., CIFAR and VDD) and detection (i.e., COCO, VOC and ICCV2021 SSLAD challenge) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves the new remarkable results.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we put forward secure network function computation over a directed acyclic network. In such a network, a sink node is required to compute with zero error a target function of which the inputs are generated as source messages at multiple source nodes, while a wiretapper, who can access any one but not more than one wiretap set in a given collection of wiretap sets, is not allowed to obtain any information about a security function of the source messages. The secure computing capacity for the above model is defined as the maximum average number of times that the target function can be securely computed with zero error at the sink node with the given collection of wiretap sets and security function for one use of the network. The characterization of this capacity is in general overwhelmingly difficult. In the current paper, we consider securely computing linear functions with a wiretapper who can eavesdrop any subset of edges up to a certain size r, referred to as the security level, with the security function being the identity function. We first prove an upper bound on the secure computing capacity, which is applicable to arbitrary network topologies and arbitrary security levels. When the security level r is equal to 0, our upper bound reduces to the computing capacity without security consideration. We discover the surprising fact that for some models, there is no penalty on the secure computing capacity compared with the computing capacity without security consideration. We further obtain an equivalent expression of the upper bound by using a graph-theoretic approach, and accordingly we develop an efficient approach for computing this bound. Furthermore, we present a construction of linear function-computing secure network codes and obtain a lower bound on the secure computing capacity. ",

We explore this open space of research and check ways to bridge the gap between existing DNN verification methods by extending existing robustness analysis methods for such autoencoder networks. While classification models using autoencoders work more or less similar to image classification NNs, the functionality of regression models is distinctly different. We introduce two definitions of robustness evaluation metrics for autoencoder-based regression models, specifically the percentage robustness and un-robustness grade. We also modified the existing Imagestar approach, adjusting the variables to take care of the specific input types for regression networks. The approach is implemented as an extension of NNV, then applied and evaluated on a dataset, with a case study experiment shown using the same dataset.

This balance of learnt components with inductive biases based on physical image formation models allows us to extrapolate far from the light source and viewer directions observed during training.

GNNs are a deep learning approach for graph-based data that incorporate graph structures into learning to generalise graph representations and output embeddings.

The majority of current implementations of GNN-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) rely heavily on labelled network traffic which can not only restrict the amount and structure of input traffic, but also the NIDSs potential to adapt to unseen attacks. To overcome these restrictions, we present Anomal-E, a GNN approach to intrusion and anomaly detection that leverages edge features and graph topological structure in a self-supervised process. This approach is, to the best our knowledge, the first successful and practical approach to network intrusion detection that utilises network flows in a self-supervised, edge leveraging GNN. Experimental results on two modern benchmark NIDS datasets not only clearly display the improvement of using Anomal-E embeddings rather than raw features, but also the potential Anomal-E has for detection on wild network traffic.

In this paper, we attribute such a large performance gap to the failure of generating high-quality proposal bags which are crucial for multiple instance learning (MIL). To address this problem, we introduce a lightweight alternative to the off-the-shelf proposal (OTSP) method and thereby create the Point-to-Box Network (P2BNet), which can construct an inter-objects balanced proposal bag by generating proposals in an anchor-like way. By fully investigating the accurate position information, P2BNet further constructs an instance-level bag, avoiding the mixture of multiple objects. Finally, a coarse-to-fine policy in a cascade fashion is utilized to improve the IoU between proposals and ground-truth (GT). Benefiting from these strategies, P2BNet is able to produce high-quality instance-level bags for object detection. P2BNet improves the mean average precision (AP) by more than 50% relative to the previous best PSOD method on the MS COCO dataset. It also demonstrates the great potential to bridge the performance gap between point supervised and bounding-box supervised detectors. The code will be released at github.com/ucas-vg/P2BNet. ",

This study aims to answer this question by comparing a data-to-text system only supplemented with a language model, to two data-to-text systems that are additionally enriched by a data augmentation or a pseudo-labeling semi-supervised learning approach. Results show that semi-supervised learning results in higher scores on diversity metrics. In terms of output quality, extending the training set of a data-to-text system with a language model using the pseudo-labeling approach did increase text quality scores, but the data augmentation approach yielded similar scores to the system without training set extension.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is seen as a very promising approach with high performance for several speech downstream tasks. Since the parameters of SSL models are generally so large that training and inference require a lot of memory and computational cost, it is desirable to produce compact SSL models without a significant performance degradation by applying compression methods such as knowledge distillation (KD). Although the KD approach is able to shrink the depth and/or width of SSL model structures, there has been little research on how varying the depth and width impacts the internal representation of the small-footprint model. This paper provides an empirical study that addresses the question. We investigate the performance on SUPERB while varying the structure and KD methods so as to keep the number of parameters constant; this allows us to analyze the contribution of the representation introduced by varying the model architecture. Experiments demonstrate that a certain depth is essential for solving content-oriented tasks (e.g. automatic speech recognition) accurately, whereas a certain width is necessary for achieving high performance on several speaker-oriented tasks (e.g. speaker identification). Based on these observations, we identify, for SUPERB, a more compressed model with better performance than previous studies. ",

While Bayesian deep learning techniques allow uncertainty estimation, training them with large-scale datasets is an expensive process that does not always yield models competitive with non-Bayesian counterparts. Moreover, many of the high-performing deep learning models that are already trained and deployed are non-Bayesian in nature and do not provide uncertainty estimates. To address these issues, we propose BayesCap that learns a Bayesian identity mapping for the frozen model, allowing uncertainty estimation. BayesCap is a memory-efficient method that can be trained on a small fraction of the original dataset, enhancing pretrained non-Bayesian computer vision models by providing calibrated uncertainty estimates for the predictions without (i) hampering the performance of the model and (ii) the need for expensive retraining the model from scratch. The proposed method is agnostic to various architectures and tasks. We show the efficacy of our method on a wide variety of tasks with a diverse set of architectures, including image super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, and crucial application such as medical image translation. Moreover, we apply the derived uncertainty estimates to detect out-of-distribution samples in critical scenarios like depth estimation in autonomous driving.

    "abstract": "Expanding an existing tourist photo from a partially captured scene to a full scene is one of the desired experiences for photography applications. Although photo extrapolation has been well studied, it is much more challenging to extrapolate a photo (i.e., selfie) from a narrow field of view to a wider one while maintaining a similar visual style. In this paper, we propose a factorized neural re-rendering model to produce photorealistic novel views from cluttered outdoor Internet photo collections, which enables the applications including controllable scene re-rendering, photo extrapolation and even extrapolated 3D photo generation. Specifically, we first develop a novel factorized re-rendering pipeline to handle the ambiguity in the decomposition of geometry, appearance and illumination. We also propose a composited training strategy to tackle the unexpected occlusion in Internet images. Moreover, to enhance photo-realism when extrapolating tourist photographs, we propose a novel realism augmentation process to complement appearance details, which automatically propagates the texture details from a narrow captured photo to the extrapolated neural rendered image. The experiments and photo editing examples on outdoor scenes demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in both photo-realism and downstream applications. ",

    "abstract": "Personalized PageRank (PPR) is a fundamental tool in unsupervised learning of graph representations such as node ranking, labeling, and graph embedding. However, while data privacy is one of the most important recent concerns, existing PPR algorithms are not designed to protect user privacy. PPR is highly sensitive to the input graph edges: the difference of only one edge may cause a big change in the PPR vector, potentially leaking private user data. In this work, we propose an algorithm which outputs an approximate PPR and has provably bounded sensitivity to input edges. In addition, we prove that our algorithm achieves similar accuracy to non-private algorithms when the input graph has large degrees. Our sensitivity-bounded PPR directly implies private algorithms for several tools of graph learning, such as, differentially private (DP) PPR ranking, DP node classification, and DP node embedding. To complement our theoretical analysis, we also empirically verify the practical performances of our algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "Demystifying the delay propagation mechanisms among multiple airports is fundamental to precise and interpretable delay prediction, which is crucial during decision-making for all aviation industry stakeholders. The principal challenge lies in effectively leveraging the spatiotemporal dependencies and exogenous factors related to the delay propagation. However, previous works only consider limited spatiotemporal patterns with few factors. To promote more comprehensive propagation modeling for delay prediction, we propose SpatioTemporal Propagation Network (STPN), a space-time separable graph convolutional network, which is novel in spatiotemporal dependency capturing. From the aspect of spatial relation modeling, we propose a multi-graph convolution model considering both geographic proximity and airline schedule. From the aspect of temporal dependency capturing, we propose a multi-head self-attentional mechanism that can be learned end-to-end and explicitly reason multiple kinds of temporal dependency of delay time series. We show that the joint spatial and temporal learning models yield a sum of the Kronecker product, which factors the spatiotemporal dependence into the sum of several spatial and temporal adjacency matrices. By this means, STPN allows cross-talk of spatial and temporal factors for modeling delay propagation. Furthermore, a squeeze and excitation module is added to each layer of STPN to boost meaningful spatiotemporal features. To this end, we apply STPN to multi-step ahead arrival and departure delay prediction in large-scale airport networks. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we experiment with two real-world delay datasets, including U.S and China flight delays; and we show that STPN outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, counterfactuals produced by STPN show that it learns explainable delay propagation patterns. ",

The state-of-the-art approaches apply a two-stage learning framework to alleviate the class-imbalance issue, where the first stage focuses on training of a general feature extractor and the second stage focuses on fine-tuning the classifier head for class rebalancing. However, existing two-stage approaches do not consider the fine-grained property between different diseases, often causing the first stage less effective for medical image classification than for natural image classification tasks. In this study, we propose embedding metric learning into the first stage of the two-stage framework specially to help the feature extractor learn to extract more discriminative feature representations. Extensive experiments mainly on three medical image datasets show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms existing onestage and two-stage approaches, suggesting that metric learning can be used as an effective plug-in component in the two-stage framework for fine-grained class-imbalanced image classification tasks.

We show that different attacks on model-based controllers can increase control costs, activate constraints, or even make the control optimization problem infeasible. We use the linear quadratic regulator and convex model predictive controllers as examples of how adversarial attacks succeed and demonstrate the impact of adversarial attacks on a battery storage control task for power grid operators.

As opposed to both existing anchor-based and anchor-free detectors, which are more biased toward specific object scales in their label assignments, we use only object center locations as positive samples and treat all objects equally in different feature levels regardless of the objects' sizes or shapes. Specifically, our label assignment strategy considers the object center locations as shape- and size-agnostic anchors in an anchor-free fashion, and allows learning to occur at all scales for every object. To support this, we define new regression targets as the distances from two corners of the center cell location to the four sides of the bounding box. Moreover, to handle scale-variant objects, we propose a tailored IoU loss to deal with boxes with different sizes. As a result, our proposed object detector does not need any dataset-dependent hyperparameters to be tuned across datasets. We evaluate our method on MS-COCO 2017 and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets, and compare our results to state-of-the-art methods. We observe that ObjectBox performs favorably in comparison to prior works.

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient detection of ovarian cancer at early stages is critical to ensure proper treatments for patients. Among the first-line modalities investigated in studies of early diagnosis are features distilled from protein mass spectra. This method, however, considers only a specific subset of spectral responses and ignores the interplay among protein expression levels, which can also contain diagnostic information. We propose a new modality that automatically searches protein mass spectra for discriminatory features by considering the self-similar nature of the spectra. Self-similarity is assessed by taking a wavelet decomposition of protein mass spectra and estimating the rate of level-wise decay in the energies of the resulting wavelet coefficients. Level-wise energies are estimated in a robust manner using distance variance, and rates are estimated locally via a rolling window approach. This results in a collection of rates that can be used to characterize the interplay among proteins, which can be indicative of cancer presence. Discriminatory descriptors are then selected from these evolutionary rates and used as classifying features. The proposed wavelet-based features are used in conjunction with features proposed in the existing literature for early stage diagnosis of ovarian cancer using two datasets published by the American National Cancer Institute. Including the wavelet-based features from the new modality results in improvements in diagnostic performance for early-stage ovarian cancer detection. This demonstrates the ability of the proposed modality to characterize new ovarian cancer diagnostic information. ",

While studies evaluating the impact of adversarial attacks on monocular depth estimation exist, a systematic demonstration and analysis of adversarial perturbations against pose estimation are lacking. We show how additive imperceptible perturbations can not only change predictions to increase the trajectory drift but also catastrophically alter its geometry. We also study the relation between adversarial perturbations targeting monocular depth and pose estimation networks, as well as the transferability of perturbations to other networks with different architectures and losses. Our experiments show how the generated perturbations lead to notable errors in relative rotation and translation predictions and elucidate vulnerabilities of the networks. ",

    "abstract": "The pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has been widely adopted in computer vision. But as the size of Vision Transformer (ViT) grows exponentially, the full finetuning becomes prohibitive in view of the heavier storage overhead. Motivated by parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) on language transformers, recent studies attempt to insert lightweight adaptation modules (e.g., adapter layers or prompt tokens) to pretrained ViT and only finetune these modules while the pretrained weights are frozen. However, these modules were originally proposed to finetune language models. Although ported well to ViT, their design lacks prior knowledge for visual tasks. In this paper, we propose to construct Convolutional Bypasses (Convpass) in ViT as adaptation modules, introducing only a small amount (less than 0.5% of model parameters) of trainable parameters to adapt the large ViT. Different from other PETL methods, Convpass benefits from the hard-coded inductive bias of convolutional layers and thus is more suitable for visual tasks, especially in the low-data regime. Experimental results on VTAB-1k benchmark and few-shot learning datasets demonstrate that Convpass outperforms current language-oriented adaptation modules, demonstrating the necessity to tailor vision-oriented adaptation modules for vision models.

    "abstract": "The 6th generation of wireless communication (6G) is envisioned to give rise to various technologies for improving the end-to-end communication performance, where the communication is envisioned to utilize wireless signals in the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies and above. Among others, these technologies comprise Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (IRSs) and Mobile Relays (MRs), whose envisaged roles include mitigating the negative effects of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) connectivity, in particular at mmWave and higher frequencies. The core idea behind these technologies is to use cooperative networking where the source sends a signal to a repeater, in this case the IRS or the MR, which is upon reception forwarded to the destination. When comparing the two technologies, it is important to realize that the IRSs are primarily envisioned to be static entities attached to various objects in the environment such as walls and furniture. In contrast, the MRs will feature a higher degree of freedom, as they will be able to position themselves seamlessly in the environment. Based on the above assumptions, we derive an approach for determining the optimal position of the IRS and MR in indoor environments, i.e., the one that maximizes the end-to-end link quality between the source and the destination. We follow by capturing the communication quality indicators for both IRS- and MR-supported NLoS avoidance in indoor mmWave communication in a number of scenarios. Our results show that, from the end-to-end link quality perspective, the MRs generally outperform the IRSs, suggesting their utilization potential for throughput-optimized NLoS avoidance scenarios.

Collecting and annotating such a training set is thus highly expensive and unscalable. Semi-supervised TAD (SS-TAD) alleviates this problem by leveraging unlabeled videos freely available at scale. However, SS-TAD is also a much more challenging problem than supervised TAD, and consequently much under-studied. Prior SS-TAD methods directly combine an existing proposal-based TAD method and a SSL method. Due to their sequential localization (e.g, proposal generation) and classification design, they are prone to proposal error propagation. To overcome this limitation, in this work we propose a novel Semi-supervised Temporal action detection model based on PropOsal-free Temporal mask (SPOT) with a parallel localization (mask generation) and classification architecture. Such a novel design effectively eliminates the dependence between localization and classification by cutting off the route for error propagation in-between. We further introduce an interaction mechanism between classification and localization for prediction refinement, and a new pretext task for self-supervised model pre-training.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a low-cost and highly accurate ECG-monitoring system intended for personalized early arrhythmia detection for wearable mobile sensors. Earlier supervised approaches for personalized ECG monitoring require both abnormal and normal heartbeats for the training of the dedicated classifier. However, in a real-world scenario where the personalized algorithm is embedded in a wearable device, such training data is not available for healthy people with no cardiac disorder history. In this study, (i) we propose a null space analysis on the healthy signal space obtained via sparse dictionary learning, and investigate how a simple null space projection or alternatively regularized least squares-based classification methods can reduce the computational complexity, without sacrificing the detection accuracy, when compared to sparse representation-based classification. (ii) Then we introduce a sparse representation-based domain adaptation technique in order to project other existing users' abnormal and normal signals onto the new user's signal space, enabling us to train the dedicated classifier without having any abnormal heartbeat of the new user. Therefore, zero-shot learning can be achieved without the need for synthetic abnormal heartbeat generation. An extensive set of experiments performed on the benchmark MIT-BIH ECG dataset shows that when this domain adaptation-based training data generator is used with a simple 1-D CNN classifier, the method outperforms the prior work by a significant margin. (iii) Then, by combining (i) and (ii), we propose an ensemble classifier that further improves the performance. This approach for zero-shot arrhythmia detection achieves an average accuracy level of 98.2% and an F1-Score of 92.8%. Finally, a personalized energy-efficient ECG monitoring scheme is proposed using the above-mentioned innovations. ",

The source updates itself with a Poisson process and also sends updates to the nodes as Poisson arrivals. Upon receiving the updates, the nodes update their knowledge about the source. The nodes gossip the data among themselves in the form of Poisson arrivals to disperse their knowledge about the source. The total gossiping rate is bounded by a constraint. The goal of the network is to be as timely as possible with the source. In this work, we propose ASUMAN, a distributed opportunistic gossiping scheme, where after each time the source updates itself, each node waits for a time proportional to its current age and broadcasts a signal to the other nodes of the network. This allows the nodes in the network which have higher age to remain silent and only the low-age nodes to gossip, thus utilizing a significant portion of the constrained total gossip rate. We calculate the average age for a typical node in such a network with symmetric settings and show that the theoretical upper bound on the age scales as $O(1)$. ASUMAN, with an average age of $O(1)$, offers significant gains compared to a system where the nodes just gossip blindly with a fixed update rate in which case the age scales as $O(\\log n)$. ",

    "abstract": "This work aims at advancing temporal action detection (TAD) using an encoder-decoder framework with action queries, similar to DETR, which has shown great success in object detection. However, the framework suffers from several problems if directly applied to TAD: the insufficient exploration of inter-query relation in the decoder, the inadequate classification training due to a limited number of training samples, and the unreliable classification scores at inference. To this end, we first propose a relational attention mechanism in the decoder, which guides the attention among queries based on their relations. Moreover, we propose two losses to facilitate and stabilize the training of action classification. Lastly, we propose to predict the localization quality of each action query at inference in order to distinguish high-quality queries. The proposed method, named ReAct, achieves the state-of-the-art performance on THUMOS14, with much lower computational costs than previous methods. Besides, extensive ablation studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of each proposed component. The code is available at https://github.com/sssste/React. ",

    "abstract": "Human relighting is a highly desirable yet challenging task. Existing works either require expensive one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) captured data using light stage or cannot freely change the viewpoints of the rendered body. In this work, we propose a principled framework, Relighting4D, that enables free-viewpoints relighting from only human videos under unknown illuminations. Our key insight is that the space-time varying geometry and reflectance of the human body can be decomposed as a set of neural fields of normal, occlusion, diffuse, and specular maps. These neural fields are further integrated into reflectance-aware physically based rendering, where each vertex in the neural field absorbs and reflects the light from the environment. The whole framework can be learned from videos in a self-supervised manner, with physically informed priors designed for regularization. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our framework is capable of relighting dynamic human actors with free-viewpoints. ",

    "abstract": "Though impressive performance has been achieved in specific visual realms (e.g. faces, dogs, and places), an omni-vision representation generalizing to many natural visual domains is highly desirable. But, existing benchmarks are biased and inefficient to evaluate the omni-vision representation -- these benchmarks either only include several specific realms, or cover most realms at the expense of subsuming numerous datasets that have extensive realm overlapping. In this paper, we propose Omni-Realm Benchmark (OmniBenchmark). It includes 21 realm-wise datasets with 7,372 concepts and 1,074,346 images. Without semantic overlapping, these datasets cover most visual realms comprehensively and meanwhile efficiently. In addition, we propose a new supervised contrastive learning framework, namely Relational Contrastive learning (ReCo), for a better omni-vision representation. Beyond pulling two instances from the same concept closer -- the typical supervised contrastive learning framework -- ReCo also pulls two instances from the same semantic realm closer, encoding the semantic relation between concepts, and facilitating omni-vision representation learning. We benchmark ReCo and other advances in omni-vision representation studies that are different in architectures (from CNNs to transformers) and in learning paradigms (from supervised learning to self-supervised learning) on OmniBenchmark. We illustrate the superior of ReCo to other supervised contrastive learning methods and reveal multiple practical observations to facilitate future research. ",

Abnormal heart rhythms can be a precursor to more serious conditions including sudden cardiac death. Classifying abnormal rhythms is a laborious process prone to error. Therefore, tools that perform automated classification with high accuracy are highly desirable. The work presented classifies five different types of ECG arrhythmia based on AAMI EC57 standard and using the MIT-BIH data set. These include non-ectopic (normal), supraventricular, ventricular, fusion, and unknown beat. By appropriately transforming pre-processed ECG waveforms into a rich feature space along with appropriate post-processing and utilizing deep convolutional neural networks post fine-tuning and hyperparameter selection, it is shown that highly accurate classification for the five waveform types can be obtained. Performance on the test set indicated higher overall accuracy (98.62%), as well as better performance in classifying each of the five waveforms than hitherto reported in literature. ",

    "abstract": "Microstructures, i.e., architected materials, are designed today, typically, by maximizing an objective, such as bulk modulus, subject to a volume constraint. However, in many applications, it is often more appropriate to impose constraints on other physical quantities of interest. In this paper, we consider such generalized microstructural optimization problems where any of the microstructural quantities, namely, bulk, shear, Poisson ratio, or volume, can serve as the objective, while the remaining can serve as constraints. In particular, we propose here a neural-network (NN) framework to solve such problems. The framework relies on the classic density formulation of microstructural optimization, but the density field is represented through the NN's weights and biases. The main characteristics of the proposed NN framework are: (1) it supports automatic differentiation, eliminating the need for manual sensitivity derivations, (2) smoothing filters are not required due to implicit filtering, (3) the framework can be easily extended to multiple-materials, and (4) a high-resolution microstructural topology can be recovered through a simple post-processing step. The framework is illustrated through a variety of microstructural optimization problems. ",

    "abstract": "Pathological diagnosis relies on the visual inspection of histologically stained thin tissue specimens, where different types of stains are applied to bring contrast to and highlight various desired histological features. However, the destructive histochemical staining procedures are usually irreversible, making it very difficult to obtain multiple stains on the same tissue section. Here, we demonstrate a virtual stain transfer framework via a cascaded deep neural network (C-DNN) to digitally transform hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained tissue images into other types of histological stains. Unlike a single neural network structure which only takes one stain type as input to digitally output images of another stain type, C-DNN first uses virtual staining to transform autofluorescence microscopy images into H&E and then performs stain transfer from H&E to the domain of the other stain in a cascaded manner. This cascaded structure in the training phase allows the model to directly exploit histochemically stained image data on both H&E and the target special stain of interest. This advantage alleviates the challenge of paired data acquisition and improves the image quality and color accuracy of the virtual stain transfer from H&E to another stain. We validated the superior performance of this C-DNN approach using kidney needle core biopsy tissue sections and successfully transferred the H&E-stained tissue images into virtual PAS (periodic acid-Schiff) stain. This method provides high-quality virtual images of special stains using existing, histochemically stained slides and creates new opportunities in digital pathology by performing highly accurate stain-to-stain transformations.

This paper defines the relevant standard mechanisms and algorithms to use the carrier phase cellular-based measurements as a potential solution to achieve a high-precision positioning estimation accuracy in 5G-advanced NR networks. The presented positioning technique is evaluated using high-fidelity system-level simulations for indoor factory (InF) deployment scenarios. The numerical results demonstrate that the presented technique can significantly improve the positioning accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art NR positioning methods. Our findings in this paper also show that the carrier phase method not only provides an indoor complement to the outdoor satellite positioning but also provides an outdoor alternative to the high-precision satellite methods.

This landmark heuristic makes L-hydra applicable to large-scale graphs and improves upon previously introduced methods. As a mathematical justification, we show that a point configuration in d-dimensional hyperbolic space can be perfectly recovered (up to isometry) from distance measurements to just d+1 landmarks. We also show that L-hydra solves a two-stage strain-minimization problem, similar to our previous (unlandmarked) method 'hydra'. Testing on real network data, we show that L-hydra is an order of magnitude faster than existing hyperbolic embedding methods and scales linearly in the number of nodes. While the embedding error of L-hydra is higher than the error of existing methods, we introduce an extension, L-hydra+, which outperforms existing methods in both runtime and embedding quality. ",

Both mechanisms naturally create shortcuts and hubs, which enhance network's navigability. They also tend to be overused during geodesic navigational processes, making the networks fragile against jamming. Why, then, networks with complex topologies are ubiquitous? Here we show that these models entropically generate network bypasses: alternative routes to shortest paths which are topologically longer but easier to navigate. We develop a mathematical theory that elucidates the emergence and consolidation of network bypasses and measures their navigability gain. We apply our theory to a wide range of real-world networks and find that they sustain complexity by different amounts of network bypasses. At the top of this complexity ranking we found the human brain, what points out the importance of these results to understand the plasticity of complex systems. ",

    "abstract": "There is abundant medical data on the internet, most of which are unlabeled. Traditional supervised learning algorithms are often limited by the amount of labeled data, especially in the medical domain, where labeling is costly in terms of human processing and specialized experts needed to label them. They are also prone to human error and biased as a select few expert annotators label them. These issues are mitigated by Self-supervision, where we generate pseudo-labels from unlabelled data by seeing the data itself. This paper presents various self-supervision strategies to enhance the performance of a time-series based Diffusion convolution recurrent neural network (DCRNN) model. The learned weights in the self-supervision pretraining phase can be transferred to the supervised training phase to boost the model's prediction capability. Our techniques are tested on an extension of a Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural network (DCRNN) model, an RNN with graph diffusion convolutions, which models the spatiotemporal dependencies present in EEG signals. When the learned weights from the pretraining stage are transferred to a DCRNN model to determine whether an EEG time window has a characteristic seizure signal associated with it, our method yields an AUROC score $1.56\\%$ than the current state-of-the-art models on the TUH EEG seizure corpus.

To obtain time diversity within the channel coherence time, we first put forward a random repetition scheme that randomizes the interference power. Then, we optimize the number of reserved slots and the number of repetitions for each packet to minimize the QoS violation probability, defined as the percentage of users that cannot achieve URLLC. We build a cascaded Random Edge Graph Neural Network (REGNN) to represent the repetition scheme and develop a model-free unsupervised learning method to train it. We analyze the QoS violation probability using stochastic geometry in a symmetric scenario and apply a model-based Exhaustive Search (ES) method to find the optimal solution. Simulation results show that in the symmetric scenario, the QoS violation probabilities achieved by the model-free learning method and the model-based ES method are nearly the same. In more general scenarios, the cascaded REGNN generalizes very well in wireless networks with different scales, network topologies, cell densities, and frequency reuse factors. It outperforms the model-based ES method in the presence of the model mismatch. ",

We show that up to multiplicative constants: the cover time is $n(\\log n)^2$, the maximum hitting time is $n\\log n$, and the average hitting time is $n$. The first two results hold in expectation and a.a.s. and the last in expectation (with respect to the HRG). We prove these results by determining the effective resistance either between an average vertex and the well-connected \"center\" of HRGs or between an appropriately chosen collection of extremal vertices.
