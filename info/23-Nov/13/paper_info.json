    "abstract": "The identification of essential proteins can help in understanding the minimum requirements for cell survival and development. Network-based centrality approaches are commonly used to identify essential proteins from protein-protein interaction networks (PINs). Unfortunately, these approaches are limited by the poor quality of the underlying PIN data. To overcome this problem, researchers have focused on the prediction of essential proteins by combining PINs with other biological data. In this paper, we proposed a network refinement method based on module discovery and biological information to obtain a higher quality PIN. First, to extract the maximal connected subgraph in the PIN and to divide it into different modules by using Fast-unfolding algorithm; then, to detect critical modules based on the homology information, subcellular localization information and topology information within each module, and to construct a more refined network (CM-PIN). To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we used 10 typical network-based centrality methods (LAC, DC, DMNC, NC, TP, LID, CC, BC, PR, LR) to compare the overall performance of the CM-PIN with those the refined dynamic protein network (RD-PIN). The experimental results showed that the CM-PIN was optimal in terms of precision-recall curve, jackknife curve and other criteria, and can help to identify essential proteins more accurately. ",

    "abstract": "Cervical spine fractures constitute a critical medical emergency, with the potential for lifelong paralysis or even fatality if left untreated or undetected. Over time, these fractures can deteriorate without intervention. To address the lack of research on the practical application of deep learning techniques for the detection of spine fractures, this study leverages a dataset containing both cervical spine fractures and non-fractured computed tomography images. This paper introduces a two-stage pipeline designed to identify the presence of cervical vertebrae in each image slice and pinpoint the location of fractures. In the first stage, a multi-input network, incorporating image and image metadata, is trained. This network is based on the Global Context Vision Transformer, and its performance is benchmarked against popular deep learning image classification model. In the second stage, a YOLOv8 model is trained to detect fractures within the images, and its effectiveness is compared to YOLOv5. The obtained results indicate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces the workload of radiologists and enhances the accuracy of fracture detection. ",

We first pre-train it by self-supervised masked training, followed by sequential training for the different tasks. We train the network on all major modalities, e.g.\\ visual, audio, text and 3D, and report results on $22$ diverse and challenging public benchmarks. We demonstrate empirically that, using a joint network to train across modalities leads to meaningful information sharing and this allows us to achieve state-of-the-art results on most of the benchmarks.

    "abstract": "In this study, the Active Control in an Intelligent and Distributed Environment (ACIDE) media distribution model solution and algorithms are proposed for livestreaming in capacity efficient mobile wireless networks. The elements of the ACIDE model are a base station and a cluster formed by a number of peers able to establish peer to peer communications. The cluster peers are selected from a group of users interested in livestreaming the same media. The ACIDE model solution minimizes the bandwidth allocated to a cluster of n peers such that an uninterrupted media play for all peers is guaranteed. The livestream media is sent to the peers in packages and every media package is divided into n blocks. The blocks are distributed to the n peers of a cluster in two phases, such that the base station bandwidth is utilized during first phase only. The allocated bandwidth, the amount of bandwidth the base station has to allocate to a cluster, is minimized and its lower bound is equal to the bandwidth required for multicasting. In this study, the ACIDE model is used to address the problem of how to find the maximum number of peers n, chosen from a group of N users, that can be admitted to a cluster knowing the given allocated bandwidth, the amount of bandwidth that a base station allocates to a cluster in advance, prior to admitting users. When users become peers of an ACIDE cluster, the network capacity, the total number of users who are able to access live media, increases meaning that network resources are used more efficiently. The problem of finding the maximum number of peers n is addressed as an optimization problem, with the objective of having the entire given allocated bandwidth used by the peers admitted to the cluster. This problem is NP-complete and a non-optimal solution is proposed for peers selection such that all admitted peers play media continuously. ",

    "abstract": "Cyber attacks are often identified using system and network logs. There have been significant prior works that utilize provenance graphs and ML techniques to detect attacks, specifically advanced persistent threats, which are very difficult to detect. Lately, there have been studies where transformer-based language models are being used to detect various types of attacks from system logs. However, no such attempts have been made in the case of APTs. In addition, existing state-of-the-art techniques that use system provenance graphs, lack a data processing framework generalized across datasets for optimal performance. For mitigating this limitation as well as exploring the effectiveness of transformer-based language models, this paper proposes LogShield, a framework designed to detect APT attack patterns leveraging the power of self-attention in transformers. We incorporate customized embedding layers to effectively capture the context of event sequences derived from provenance graphs. While acknowledging the computational overhead associated with training transformer networks, our framework surpasses existing LSTM and Language models regarding APT detection. We integrated the model parameters and training procedure from the RoBERTa model and conducted extensive experiments on well-known APT datasets (DARPA OpTC and DARPA TC E3). Our framework achieved superior F1 scores of 98% and 95% on the two datasets respectively, surpassing the F1 scores of 96% and 94% obtained by LSTM models. Our findings suggest that LogShield's performance benefits from larger datasets and demonstrates its potential for generalization across diverse domains. These findings contribute to the advancement of APT attack detection methods and underscore the significance of transformer-based architectures in addressing security challenges in computer systems.

    "abstract": "Programming-by-example is the task of synthesizing a program that is consistent with a set of user-provided input-output examples. As examples are often an under-specification of one's intent, a good synthesizer must choose the intended program from the many that are consistent with the given set of examples. Prior work frames program synthesis as a cooperative game between a listener (that synthesizes programs) and a speaker (a user choosing examples), and shows that models of computational pragmatic inference are effective in choosing the user intended programs. However, these models require counterfactual reasoning over a large set of programs and examples, which is infeasible in realistic program spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel way to amortize this search with neural networks. We sample pairs of programs and examples via self-play between listener and speaker models, and use pragmatic inference to choose informative training examples from this sample.We then use the informative dataset to train models to improve the synthesizer's ability to disambiguate user-provided examples without human supervision. We validate our method on the challenging task of synthesizing regular expressions from example strings, and find that our method (1) outperforms models trained without choosing pragmatic examples by 23% (a 51% relative increase) (2) matches the performance of supervised learning on a dataset of pragmatic examples provided by humans, despite using no human data in training.

    "abstract": "We propose a general method to break down a main complex task into a set of intermediary easier sub-tasks, which are formulated in natural language as binary questions related to the final target task. Our method allows for representing each example by a vector consisting of the answers to these questions. We call this representation Natural Language Learned Features (NLLF). NLLF is generated by a small transformer language model (e.g., BERT) that has been trained in a Natural Language Inference (NLI) fashion, using weak labels automatically obtained from a Large Language Model (LLM). We show that the LLM normally struggles for the main task using in-context learning, but can handle these easiest subtasks and produce useful weak labels to train a BERT. The NLI-like training of the BERT allows for tackling zero-shot inference with any binary question, and not necessarily the ones seen during the training. We show that this NLLF vector not only helps to reach better performances by enhancing any classifier, but that it can be used as input of an easy-to-interpret machine learning model like a decision tree. This decision tree is interpretable but also reaches high performances, surpassing those of a pre-trained transformer in some cases.We have successfully applied this method to two completely different tasks: detecting incoherence in students' answers to open-ended mathematics exam questions, and screening abstracts for a systematic literature review of scientific papers on climate change and agroecology.

    "abstract": "Graph convolutions have been a pivotal element in learning graph representations. However, recursively aggregating neighboring information with graph convolutions leads to indistinguishable node features in deep layers, which is known as the over-smoothing issue. The performance of graph neural networks decays fast as the number of stacked layers increases, and the Dirichlet energy associated with the graph decreases to zero as well. In this work, we introduce a framelet system into the analysis of Dirichlet energy and take a multi-scale perspective to leverage the Dirichlet energy and alleviate the over-smoothing issue. Specifically, we develop a Framelet Augmentation strategy by adjusting the update rules with positive and negative increments for low-pass and high-passes respectively. Based on that, we design the Energy Enhanced Convolution (EEConv), which is an effective and practical operation that is proved to strictly enhance Dirichlet energy. From a message-passing perspective, EEConv inherits multi-hop aggregation property from the framelet transform and takes into account all hops in the multi-scale representation, which benefits the node classification tasks over heterophilous graphs. Experiments show that deep GNNs with EEConv achieve state-of-the-art performance over various node classification datasets, especially for heterophilous graphs, while also lifting the Dirichlet energy as the network goes deeper.

    "abstract": "Dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and surface normal prediction, can be easily formulated as per-pixel classification (discrete outputs) or regression (continuous outputs). This per-pixel prediction paradigm has remained popular due to the prevalence of fully convolutional networks. However, on the recent frontier of segmentation task, the community has been witnessing a shift of paradigm from per-pixel prediction to cluster-prediction with the emergence of transformer architectures, particularly the mask transformers, which directly predicts a label for a mask instead of a pixel. Despite this shift, methods based on the per-pixel prediction paradigm still dominate the benchmarks on the other dense prediction tasks that require continuous outputs, such as depth estimation and surface normal prediction. Motivated by the success of DORN and AdaBins in depth estimation, achieved by discretizing the continuous output space, we propose to generalize the cluster-prediction based method to general dense prediction tasks. This allows us to unify dense prediction tasks with the mask transformer framework. Remarkably, the resulting model PolyMaX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks of NYUD-v2 dataset. We hope our simple yet effective design can inspire more research on exploiting mask transformers for more dense prediction tasks. Code and model will be made available. ",

While this problem can be posed as a linear program that optimizes flows over a space-charge-time graph, the size of the resulting optimization problem does not allow for real-time implementation in realistic settings. In this work, we present the E-AMoD control problem through the lens of reinforcement learning and propose a graph network-based framework to achieve drastically improved scalability and superior performance over heuristics. Specifically, we adopt a bi-level formulation where we (1) leverage a graph network-based RL agent to specify a desired next state in the space-charge graph, and (2) solve more tractable linear programs to best achieve the desired state while ensuring feasibility. Experiments using real-world data from San Francisco and New York City show that our approach achieves up to 89% of the profits of the theoretically-optimal solution while achieving more than a 100x speedup in computational time. Furthermore, our approach outperforms the best domain-specific heuristics with comparable runtimes, with an increase in profits by up to 3x.

    "abstract": "In a data-centric era, concerns regarding privacy and ethical data handling grow as machine learning relies more on personal information. This empirical study investigates the privacy, generalization, and stability of deep learning models in the presence of additive noise in federated learning frameworks. Our main objective is to provide strategies to measure the generalization, stability, and privacy-preserving capabilities of these models and further improve them. To this end, five noise infusion mechanisms at varying noise levels within centralized and federated learning settings are explored. As model complexity is a key component of the generalization and stability of deep learning models during training and evaluation, a comparative analysis of three Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures is provided. The paper introduces Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) as a quantitative measure of the trade-off between privacy and training accuracy of noise-infused models, aiming to find the noise level that yields optimal privacy and accuracy. Moreover, the Price of Stability and Price of Anarchy are defined in the context of privacy-preserving deep learning, contributing to the systematic investigation of the noise infusion strategies to enhance privacy without compromising performance. Our research sheds light on the delicate balance between these critical factors, fostering a deeper understanding of the implications of noise-based regularization in machine learning.

    "abstract": "Federated learning is known for its capability to safeguard participants' data privacy. However, recently emerged model inversion attacks (MIAs) have shown that a malicious parameter server can reconstruct individual users' local data samples through model updates. The state-of-the-art attacks either rely on computation-intensive search-based optimization processes to recover each input batch, making scaling difficult, or they involve the malicious parameter server adding extra modules before the global model architecture, rendering the attacks too conspicuous and easily detectable. To overcome these limitations, we propose Scale-MIA, a novel MIA capable of efficiently and accurately recovering training samples of clients from the aggregated updates, even when the system is under the protection of a robust secure aggregation protocol. Unlike existing approaches treating models as black boxes, Scale-MIA recognizes the importance of the intricate architecture and inner workings of machine learning models. It identifies the latent space as the critical layer for breaching privacy and decomposes the complex recovery task into an innovative two-step process to reduce computation complexity. The first step involves reconstructing the latent space representations (LSRs) from the aggregated model updates using a closed-form inversion mechanism, leveraging specially crafted adversarial linear layers. In the second step, the whole input batches are recovered from the LSRs by feeding them into a fine-tuned generative decoder. We implemented Scale-MIA on multiple commonly used machine learning models and conducted comprehensive experiments across various settings. The results demonstrate that Scale-MIA achieves excellent recovery performance on different datasets, exhibiting high reconstruction rates, accuracy, and attack efficiency on a larger scale compared to state-of-the-art MIAs.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a promising technology that enables multiple actors to build a joint model without sharing their raw data. The distributed nature makes FL vulnerable to various poisoning attacks, including model poisoning attacks and data poisoning attacks. Today, many byzantine-resilient FL methods have been introduced to mitigate the model poisoning attack, while the effectiveness when defending against data poisoning attacks still remains unclear. In this paper, we focus on the most representative data poisoning attack - \"label flipping attack\" and monitor its effectiveness when attacking the existing FL methods. The results show that the existing FL methods perform similarly in Independent and identically distributed (IID) settings but fail to maintain the model robustness in Non-IID settings. To mitigate the weaknesses of existing FL methods in Non-IID scenarios, we introduce the Honest Score Client Selection (HSCS) scheme and the corresponding HSCSFL framework. In the HSCSFL, The server collects a clean dataset for evaluation. Under each iteration, the server collects the gradients from clients and then perform HSCS to select aggregation candidates. The server first evaluates the performance of each class of the global model and generates the corresponding risk vector to indicate which class could be potentially attacked. Similarly, the server evaluates the client's model and records the performance of each class as the accuracy vector. The dot product of each client's accuracy vector and global risk vector is generated as the client's host score; only the top p\\% host score clients are included in the following aggregation. Finally, server aggregates the gradients and uses the outcome to update the global model. The comprehensive experimental results show our HSCSFL effectively enhances the FL robustness and defends against the \"label flipping attack.\" ",

    "title": "Robust Constant-Time Cryptography",
    "abstract": "The constant-time property is considered the security standard for cryptographic code. Code following the constant-time discipline is free from secret-dependent branches and memory accesses, and thus avoids leaking secrets through cache and timing side-channels. The constant-time property makes a number of implicit assumptions that are fundamentally at odds with the reality of cryptographic code. Constant-time is not robust. The first issue with constant-time is that it is a whole-program property: It relies on the entirety of the code base being constant-time. But, cryptographic developers do not generally write whole programs; rather, they provide libraries and specific algorithms for other application developers to use. As such, developers of security libraries must maintain their security guarantees even when their code is operating within (potentially untrusted) application contexts. Constant-time requires memory safety. The whole-program nature of constant-time also leads to a second issue: constant-time requires memory safety of all the running code. Any memory safety bugs, whether in the library or the application, will wend their way back to side-channel leaks of secrets if not direct disclosure. And although cryptographic libraries should (and are) written to be memory-safe, it is unfortunately unrealistic to expect the same from every application that uses each library. We formalize robust constant-time and build a RobustIsoCrypt compiler that transforms the library code and protects the secrets even when they are linked with untrusted code. Our evaluation with SUPERCOP benchmarking framework shows that the performance overhead is less than five percent on average. ",

    "title": "Watermarking Vision-Language Pre-trained Models for Multi-modal  Embedding as a Service",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in vision-language pre-trained models (VLPs) have significantly increased visual understanding and cross-modal analysis capabilities. Companies have emerged to provide multi-modal Embedding as a Service (EaaS) based on VLPs (e.g., CLIP-based VLPs), which cost a large amount of training data and resources for high-performance service. However, existing studies indicate that EaaS is vulnerable to model extraction attacks that induce great loss for the owners of VLPs. Protecting the intellectual property and commercial ownership of VLPs is increasingly crucial yet challenging. A major solution of watermarking model for EaaS implants a backdoor in the model by inserting verifiable trigger embeddings into texts, but it is only applicable for large language models and is unrealistic due to data and model privacy. In this paper, we propose a safe and robust backdoor-based embedding watermarking method for VLPs called VLPMarker. VLPMarker utilizes embedding orthogonal transformation to effectively inject triggers into the VLPs without interfering with the model parameters, which achieves high-quality copyright verification and minimal impact on model performance. To enhance the watermark robustness, we further propose a collaborative copyright verification strategy based on both backdoor trigger and embedding distribution, enhancing resilience against various attacks. We increase the watermark practicality via an out-of-distribution trigger selection approach, removing access to the model training data and thus making it possible for many real-world scenarios. Our extensive experiments on various datasets indicate that the proposed watermarking approach is effective and safe for verifying the copyright of VLPs for multi-modal EaaS and robust against model extraction attacks.

    "abstract": "Learning feature interaction is the critical backbone to building recommender systems. In web-scale applications, learning feature interaction is extremely challenging due to the sparse and large input feature space; meanwhile, manually crafting effective feature interactions is infeasible because of the exponential solution space. We propose to leverage a Transformer-based architecture with attention layers to automatically capture feature interactions. Transformer architectures have witnessed great success in many domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. However, there has not been much adoption of Transformer architecture for feature interaction modeling in industry. We aim at closing the gap. We identify two key challenges for applying the vanilla Transformer architecture to web-scale recommender systems: (1) Transformer architecture fails to capture the heterogeneous feature interactions in the self-attention layer; (2) The serving latency of Transformer architecture might be too high to be deployed in web-scale recommender systems. We first propose a heterogeneous self-attention layer, which is a simple yet effective modification to the self-attention layer in Transformer, to take into account the heterogeneity of feature interactions. We then introduce \\textsc{Hiformer} (\\textbf{H}eterogeneous \\textbf{I}nteraction Trans\\textbf{former}) to further improve the model expressiveness. With low-rank approximation and model pruning, \\hiformer enjoys fast inference for online deployment. Extensive offline experiment results corroborates the effectiveness and efficiency of the \\textsc{Hiformer} model. We have successfully deployed the \\textsc{Hiformer} model to a real world large scale App ranking model at Google Play, with significant improvement in key engagement metrics (up to +2.66\\%). ",

    "abstract": "The recently proposed tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA) methods based on tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) have achieved numerous successes in many fields. However, most of these methods are only applicable to third-order tensors, whereas the data obtained in practice are often of higher order, such as fourth-order color videos, fourth-order hyperspectral videos, and fifth-order light-field images. Additionally, in the t-SVD framework, the multi-rank of a tensor can describe more fine-grained low-rank structure in the tensor compared with the tubal rank. However, determining the multi-rank of a tensor is a much more difficult problem than determining the tubal rank. Moreover, most of the existing TRPCA methods do not explicitly model the noises except the sparse noise, which may compromise the accuracy of estimating the low-rank tensor. In this work, we propose a novel high-order TRPCA method, named as Low-Multi-rank High-order Bayesian Robust Tensor Factorization (LMH-BRTF), within the Bayesian framework. Specifically, we decompose the observed corrupted tensor into three parts, i.e., the low-rank component, the sparse component, and the noise component. By constructing a low-rank model for the low-rank component based on the order-$d$ t-SVD and introducing a proper prior for the model, LMH-BRTF can automatically determine the tensor multi-rank. Meanwhile, benefiting from the explicit modeling of both the sparse and noise components, the proposed method can leverage information from the noises more effectivly, leading to an improved performance of TRPCA. Then, an efficient variational inference algorithm is established for parameters estimation. Empirical studies on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of both qualitative and quantitative results. ",

Leveraging object information within scenes to enhance the distinguishability of feature representations has emerged as a key approach in this domain. Currently, most object-assisted methods use a separate branch to process object information, combining object and scene features heuristically. However, few of them pay attention to interpretably handle the hidden discriminative knowledge within object information. In this paper, we propose to leverage discriminative object knowledge to enhance scene feature representations. Initially, we capture the object-scene discriminative relationships from a probabilistic perspective, which are transformed into an Inter-Object Discriminative Prototype (IODP). Given the abundant prior knowledge from IODP, we subsequently construct a Discriminative Graph Network (DGN), in which pixel-level scene features are defined as nodes and the discriminative relationships between node features are encoded as edges. DGN aims to incorporate inter-object discriminative knowledge into the image representation through graph convolution. With the proposed IODP and DGN, we obtain state-of-the-art results on several widely used scene datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ",

Previous sperm assessment studies with deep learning have used datasets comprising images that include only sperm heads, which cannot consider motility and other morphologies of sperm. Furthermore, the labels of the dataset are one-hot, which provides insufficient support for experts, because assessment results are inconsistent between experts, and they have no absolute answer. Therefore, we constructed the video dataset for sperm assessment whose videos include sperm head as well as neck and tail, and its labels were annotated with soft-label. Furthermore, we proposed the sperm assessment framework and the neural network, RoSTFine, for sperm video recognition. Experimental results showed that RoSTFine could improve the sperm assessment performances compared to existing video recognition models and focus strongly on important sperm parts (i.e., head and neck).

In safety-critical applications, these predictions are only meaningful when complemented with reliable uncertainty estimates.

We show that standard uncertainty quantification techniques, like Bayesian methods or conformal prediction, can lead to inconsistency across exits. We address this problem by applying anytime-valid confidence sequences (AVCSs) to the exits of EENNs. By design, AVCSs maintain consistency across exits. We examine the theoretical and practical challenges of applying AVCSs to EENNs and empirically validate our approach on both regression and classification tasks. ",

Exploiting the structured nature of such problems, we introduce a consistent truncation method that effectively reduces the problem to a finite-dimensional convex optimization problem. By consistent we mean that the solution to this finite-dimensional problem allows to closely approximate the infinite-dimensional solution with arbitrary precision. Furthermore, we establish a link between the harmonic framework and the time domain setting, emphasizing the advantages over Periodic Differential LMIs (PDLMIs). We illustrate that our proposed framework is not only theoretically sound but also practically applicable to solving H 2 and H$\\infty$ harmonic control design problems. To enable this, we extend the definitions of H 2 and H$\\infty$ norms into the harmonic space, leveraging the concepts of the harmonic transfer function and the average trace operator for Toeplitz Block operators.

    "abstract": "There has been a growing interest in realizing the resilient consensus of the multi-agent system (MAS) under cyber-attacks, which aims to achieve the consensus of normal agents (i.e., agents without attacks) in a network, depending on the neighboring information. The literature has developed mean-subsequence-reduced (MSR) algorithms for the MAS with F adversarial attacks and has shown that the consensus is achieved for the normal agents when the communication network is at least (2F+1)-robust. However, such a stringent requirement on the communication network needs to be relaxed to enable more practical applications. Our objective is, for the first time, to achieve less stringent conditions on the network, while ensuring the resilient consensus for the general linear MAS subject to control input constraints. In this work, we propose a distributed resilient consensus framework, consisting of a pre-designed consensus protocol and distributed model predictive control (DMPC) optimization, which can help significantly reduce the requirement on the network robustness and effectively handle the general linear constrained MAS under adversarial attacks. By employing a novel distributed adversarial attack detection mechanism based on the history information broadcast by neighbors and a convex set (i.e., resilience set), we can evaluate the reliability of communication links. Moreover, we show that the recursive feasibility of the associated DMPC optimization problem can be guaranteed. The proposed consensus protocol features the following properties: 1) by minimizing a group of control variables, the consensus performance is optimized; 2) the resilient consensus of the general linear constrained MAS subject to F-locally adversarial attacks is achieved when the communication network is (F+1)-robust. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to verify the theoretical results. ",

In this paper, we revisit the value of ID embeddings for multimodal recommendation and conduct a thorough study regarding its semantics, which we recognize as subtle features of content and structures. Then, we propose a novel recommendation model by incorporating ID embeddings to enhance the semantic features of both content and structures. Specifically, we put forward a hierarchical attention mechanism to incorporate ID embeddings in modality fusing, coupled with contrastive learning, to enhance content representations. Meanwhile, we propose a lightweight graph convolutional network for each modality to amalgamate neighborhood and ID embeddings for improving structural representations. Finally, the content and structure representations are combined to form the ultimate item embedding for recommendation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (Baby, Sports, and Clothing) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art multimodal recommendation methods and the effectiveness of fine-grained ID embeddings.

It uses a structural analysis technique to identify promising protected input patterns and explores them using the oracle under the OG model.

In this work, we propose a novel approach for adversarial attack detection for deep neural network-based relative pose estimation schemes based on the explainability concept. We develop for an orbital rendezvous scenario an innovative relative pose estimation technique adopting our proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which takes an image from the chaser's onboard camera and outputs accurately the target's relative position and rotation. We perturb seamlessly the input images using adversarial attacks that are generated by the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM). The adversarial attack detector is then built based on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network which takes the explainability measure namely SHapley Value from the CNN-based pose estimator and flags the detection of adversarial attacks when acting. Simulation results show that the proposed adversarial attack detector achieves a detection accuracy of 99.21%. Both the deep relative pose estimator and adversarial attack detector are then tested on real data captured from our laboratory-designed setup. The experimental results from our laboratory-designed setup demonstrate that the proposed adversarial attack detector achieves an average detection accuracy of 96.29%. ",

    "abstract": "Learning the causes of time-series data is a fundamental task in many applications, spanning from finance to earth sciences or bio-medical applications. Common approaches for this task are based on vector auto-regression, and they do not take into account unknown confounding between potential causes. However, in settings with many potential causes and noisy data, these approaches may be substantially biased. Furthermore, potential causes may be correlated in practical applications. Moreover, existing algorithms often do not work with cyclic data. To address these challenges, we propose a new doubly robust method for Structure Identification from Temporal Data ( SITD ). We provide theoretical guarantees, showing that our method asymptotically recovers the true underlying causal structure. Our analysis extends to cases where the potential causes have cycles and they may be confounded. We further perform extensive experiments to showcase the superior performance of our method. ",

Although some impressive progress has been made in walking stability and skill learning in the field of legged robots, their ability to fast adaptation is still inferior to that of animals in nature. Animals are born with massive skills needed to survive, and can quickly acquire new ones, by composing fundamental skills with limited experience. Inspired by this, we propose a novel framework, named Robot Skill Graph (RSG) for organizing massive fundamental skills of robots and dexterously reusing them for fast adaptation. Bearing a structure similar to the Knowledge Graph (KG), RSG is composed of massive dynamic behavioral skills instead of static knowledge in KG and enables discovering implicit relations that exist in be-tween of learning context and acquired skills of robots, serving as a starting point for understanding subtle patterns existing in robots' skill learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RSG can provide rational skill inference upon new tasks and environments and enable quadruped robots to adapt to new scenarios and learn new skills rapidly.

The resulting problem structure remains identical to a standard network flow model, a linear problem, which can be solved in polynomial time for a given ride-pooling request assignment. In order to compute such a ride-pooling assignment, we devise a polynomial-time knapsack-like algorithm that is optimal w.r.t. the minimum user travel time instance of the original problem. Finally, we conduct two case studies of Sioux Falls and Manhattan, where we validate our models against state-of-the-art time-varying results, and we quantitatively highlight the effects that maximum waiting time and maximum delay thresholds have on the vehicle hours traveled, overall pooled rides and actual delay experienced. We show that for a sufficient number of requests, with a maximum waiting time and delay of 5 minutes, it is possible to ride-pool more than 80% of the requests for both case studies. Last, allowing for four people ride-pooling can significantly boost the performance of the system. ",

However, there exists an inescapable risk of privacy leakage in the fine-grained user mobility trajectories required by individual-level infection prediction. In this paper, we focus on developing a framework of privacy-preserving individual-level infection prediction based on federated learning (FL) and graph neural networks (GNN). We propose Falcon, a Federated grAph Learning method for privacy-preserving individual-level infeCtion predictiON. It utilizes a novel hypergraph structure with spatio-temporal hyperedges to describe the complex interactions between individuals and locations in the contagion process. By organically combining the FL framework with hypergraph neural networks, the information propagation process of the graph machine learning is able to be divided into two stages distributed on the server and the clients, respectively, so as to effectively protect user privacy while transmitting high-level information. Furthermore, it elaborately designs a differential privacy perturbation mechanism as well as a plausible pseudo location generation approach to preserve user privacy in the graph structure. Besides, it introduces a cooperative coupling mechanism between the individual-level prediction model and an additional region-level model to mitigate the detrimental impacts caused by the injected obfuscation mechanisms. Extensive experimental results show that our methodology outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and is able to protect user privacy against actual privacy attacks.

    "abstract": "Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) aim to infer whether a target data record has been utilized for model training or not. Prior attempts have quantified the privacy risks of language models (LMs) via MIAs, but there is still no consensus on whether existing MIA algorithms can cause remarkable privacy leakage on practical Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing MIAs designed for LMs can be classified into two categories: reference-free and reference-based attacks. They are both based on the hypothesis that training records consistently strike a higher probability of being sampled. Nevertheless, this hypothesis heavily relies on the overfitting of target models, which will be mitigated by multiple regularization methods and the generalization of LLMs. The reference-based attack seems to achieve promising effectiveness in LLMs, which measures a more reliable membership signal by comparing the probability discrepancy between the target model and the reference model. However, the performance of reference-based attack is highly dependent on a reference dataset that closely resembles the training dataset, which is usually inaccessible in the practical scenario. Overall, existing MIAs are unable to effectively unveil privacy leakage over practical fine-tuned LLMs that are overfitting-free and private. We propose a Membership Inference Attack based on Self-calibrated Probabilistic Variation (SPV-MIA). Specifically, since memorization in LLMs is inevitable during the training process and occurs before overfitting, we introduce a more reliable membership signal, probabilistic variation, which is based on memorization rather than overfitting. Furthermore, we introduce a self-prompt approach, which constructs the dataset to fine-tune the reference model by prompting the target LLM itself. In this manner, the adversary can collect a dataset with a similar distribution from public APIs. ",

A major benefit of the approach is that both the lidar imagery and the base map for the labels have free and open access.

To describe objects with similar overall appearance but subtle differences, more and more studies focus on hashing-based fine-grained image retrieval. Existing hashing networks usually generate both local and global features through attention guidance on the same deep activation tensor, which limits the diversity of feature representations. To handle this limitation, we substitute convolutional descriptors for attention-guided features and propose an Attributes Grouping and Mining Hashing (AGMH), which groups and embeds the category-specific visual attributes in multiple descriptors to generate a comprehensive feature representation for efficient fine-grained image retrieval. Specifically, an Attention Dispersion Loss (ADL) is designed to force the descriptors to attend to various local regions and capture diverse subtle details. Moreover, we propose a Stepwise Interactive External Attention (SIEA) to mine critical attributes in each descriptor and construct correlations between fine-grained attributes and objects. The attention mechanism is dedicated to learning discrete attributes, which will not cost additional computations in hash codes generation. Finally, the compact binary codes are learned by preserving pairwise similarities. Experimental results demonstrate that AGMH consistently yields the best performance against state-of-the-art methods on fine-grained benchmark datasets. ",

TransU-Net, incorporating Transformer structures, demonstrated superior segmentation accuracy and IoU metrics, outperforming both U-Net and Attention-U-net.

To enhance the security of data transmission, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS, i.e., firewalls) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS, i.e., packet sniffers) are used to detect potential threats in the exchanged data. IPSs and IDSs are usually designed as software programs running on a server machine. However, when the speed of exchanged data is too high, this solution can become unreliable. In this case, IPSs and IDSs designed on a real hardware platform, such as ASICs and FPGAs, represent a more reliable solution. This paper presents a packet sniffer that was designed using a commercial FPGA development board. The system can support a data throughput of 10 Gbit/s with preliminary results showing that the speed of data transmission can be reliably extended to 100 Gbit/s. The designed system is highly configurable by the user and can enhance the data protection of information transmitted using the Ethernet protocol. It is particularly suited for the security of universities and research centers, where point-to-point network connections are dominant and large amount of sensitive data are shared among different hosts.

We rethink the stereo or the structure-from-motion paradigms used to train unsupervised monocular depth models as a probabilistic problem. Within a single forward pass inference, this model provides a depth prediction and a measure of its confidence, without increasing the inference time. We then improve the performance on depth and uncertainty with a novel self-distillation loss for which a student is supervised by a pseudo ground truth that is a probability distribution on depth output by a teacher.

    "abstract": "The concept of Rao-Blackwellization is employed to improve predictions of artificial neural networks by physical information. The error norm and the proof of improvement are transferred from the original statistical concept to a deterministic one, using sufficient information on physics-based conditions. The proposed strategy is applied to material modeling and illustrated by examples of the identification of a yield function, elasto-plastic steel simulations, the identification of driving forces for quasi-brittle damage and rubber experiments. Sufficient physical information is employed, e.g., in the form of invariants, parameters of a minimization problem, dimensional analysis, isotropy and differentiability. It is proven how intuitive accretion of information can yield improvement if it is physically sufficient, but also how insufficient or superfluous information can cause impairment. Opportunities for the improvement of artificial neural networks are explored in terms of the training data set, the networks' structure and output filters. Even crude initial predictions are remarkably improved by reducing noise, overfitting and data requirements. ",

However, existing methods often face challenges in consistently achieving satisfactory performance and lack interpretability, which hinders our understanding of anomaly detection decisions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to graph anomaly detection that leverages the power of interpretability to enhance performance. Specifically, our method extracts an attention map derived from gradients of graph neural networks, which serves as a basis for scoring anomalies. In addition, we conduct theoretical analysis using synthetic data to validate our method and gain insights into its decision-making process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we extensively evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art graph anomaly detection techniques.

Instantiation control, enforced with TEE-supported leases, mitigates Sybil/Fork Attacks without incurring the high costs of solving crypto-puzzles.

Next, we propose random access protocols for a cell-free wireless network, ensuring successful transmission for multiple users with limited delay and energy loss, exploiting the combined effect of random atmospheric absorption, non-linearity of fading, hardware impairments, and antenna misalignment errors. We consider two schemes: a fixed transmission probability (FTP) scheme where the transmission probability (TP) of each user is updated at the beginning of the data transmission and an adaptive transmission probability (ATP) scheme where the TP is updated with each successful reception of the data. We analyze the performance of both protocols using delay, energy consumption, and outage probability with scaling laws for the transmission of a data frame consisting of a single packet from users at a predefined quality of service (QoS).

We present a minimal, computationally efficient Time Scale Network combining the translation and dilation sequence used in discrete wavelet transforms with traditional convolutional neural networks and back-propagation. The network simultaneously learns features at many time scales for sequence classification with significantly reduced parameters and operations. We demonstrate advantages in Atrial Dysfunction detection including: superior accuracy-per-parameter and accuracy-per-operation, fast training and inference speeds, and visualization and interpretation of learned patterns in atrial dysfunction detection on ECG signals. We also demonstrate impressive performance in seizure prediction using EEG signals. Our network isolated a few time scales that could be strategically selected to achieve 90.9% accuracy using only 1,133 active parameters and consistently converged on pulsatile waveform shapes. This method does not rest on any constraints or assumptions regarding signal content and could be leveraged in any area of time series analysis dealing with signals containing features at many time scales.

Out of it, 80% of the data are unstructured and remaining 20% are structured and semi-structured. The produced data are in heterogeneous format and without following any standards. Among heterogeneous (structured, semi-structured and unstructured) data, textual data are nowadays used by industries for prediction and visualization of future challenges. Extracting useful information from it is really challenging for stakeholders due to lexical and semantic matching. Few studies have been solving this issue by using ontologies and semantic tools, but the main limitations of proposed work were the less coverage of multidimensional terms. To solve this problem, this study aims to produce a novel multidimensional reference model using linguistics categories for heterogeneous textual datasets. The categories such context, semantic and syntactic clues are focused along with their score. The main contribution of MRM is that it checks each tokens with each term based on indexing of linguistic categories such as synonym, antonym, formal, lexical word order and co-occurrence. The experiments show that the percentage of MRM is better than the state-of-the-art single dimension reference model in terms of more coverage, linguistics categories and heterogeneous datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting has shown great importance in numerous industries. Current state-of-the-art graph neural network (GNN)-based forecasting methods usually require both graph networks (e.g., GCN) and temporal networks (e.g., LSTM) to capture inter-series (spatial) dynamics and intra-series (temporal) dependencies, respectively. However, the uncertain compatibility of the two networks puts an extra burden on handcrafted model designs. Moreover, the separate spatial and temporal modeling naturally violates the unified spatiotemporal inter-dependencies in real world, which largely hinders the forecasting performance. To overcome these problems, we explore an interesting direction of directly applying graph networks and rethink MTS forecasting from a pure graph perspective. We first define a novel data structure, hypervariate graph, which regards each series value (regardless of variates or timestamps) as a graph node, and represents sliding windows as space-time fully-connected graphs. This perspective considers spatiotemporal dynamics unitedly and reformulates classic MTS forecasting into the predictions on hypervariate graphs. Then, we propose a novel architecture Fourier Graph Neural Network (FourierGNN) by stacking our proposed Fourier Graph Operator (FGO) to perform matrix multiplications in Fourier space. FourierGNN accommodates adequate expressiveness and achieves much lower complexity, which can effectively and efficiently accomplish the forecasting. Besides, our theoretical analysis reveals FGO's equivalence to graph convolutions in the time domain, which further verifies the validity of FourierGNN. Extensive experiments on seven datasets have demonstrated our superior performance with higher efficiency and fewer parameters compared with state-of-the-art methods. ",

However, most of the current few-shot action recognition methods still rely on 2D frame-level representations, often require additional components to model temporal relations, and employ complex distance functions to achieve accurate alignment of these representations. In addition, existing methods struggle to effectively integrate textual semantics, some resorting to concatenation or addition of textual and visual features, and some using text merely as an additional supervision without truly achieving feature fusion and information transfer from different modalities. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective Semantic-Aware Few-Shot Action Recognition (SAFSAR) model to address these issues. We show that directly leveraging a 3D feature extractor combined with an effective feature-fusion scheme, and a simple cosine similarity for classification can yield better performance without the need of extra components for temporal modeling or complex distance functions. We introduce an innovative scheme to encode the textual semantics into the video representation which adaptively fuses features from text and video, and encourages the visual encoder to extract more semantically consistent features. In this scheme, SAFSAR achieves alignment and fusion in a compact way. Experiments on five challenging few-shot action recognition benchmarks under various settings demonstrate that the proposed SAFSAR model significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance. ",

In this study, we investigate how neural networks exhibit shape bias during training on synthetic datasets, serving as an indicator of the synthetic data quality. Specifically, our findings indicate three key points: (1) Shape bias varies across network architectures and types of supervision, casting doubt on its reliability as a predictor for generalization and its ability to explain differences in model recognition compared to human capabilities. (2) Relying solely on shape bias to estimate generalization is unreliable, as it is entangled with diversity and naturalism. (3) We propose a novel interpretation of shape bias as a tool for estimating the diversity of samples within a dataset. Our research aims to clarify the implications of using synthetic data and its associated shape bias in deep learning, addressing concerns regarding generalization and dataset quality. ",

However, it has recently been utilized to secure machine learning (ML) models from poisoning attacks, with DP-SGD receiving substantial attention. Nevertheless, a thorough investigation is required to assess the effectiveness of different DP techniques in preventing backdoor attacks in practice. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of DP-SGD and, for the first time in literature, examine PATE in the context of backdoor attacks. We also explore the role of different components of DP algorithms in defending against backdoor attacks and will show that PATE is effective against these attacks due to the bagging structure of the teacher models it employs. Our experiments reveal that hyperparameters and the number of backdoors in the training dataset impact the success of DP algorithms. Additionally, we propose Label-DP as a faster and more accurate alternative to DP-SGD and PATE. We conclude that while Label-DP algorithms generally offer weaker privacy protection, accurate hyper-parameter tuning can make them more effective than DP methods in defending against backdoor attacks while maintaining model accuracy.

Directed Laplacian linear system solvers are crucial algorithmic primitives to fast computation of fundamental problems on random walks, such as computing stationary distribution, hitting and commute time, and personalized PageRank vectors. While spectral sparsification is well understood for undirected graphs and it is known that for every graph $G,$ $(1+\\varepsilon)$-sparsifiers with $O(n\\varepsilon^{-2})$ edges exist [Batson-Spielman-Srivastava, STOC '09] (which is optimal), the best known constructions of Eulerian sparsifiers require $\\Omega(n\\varepsilon^{-2}\\log^4 n)$ edges and are based on short-cycle decompositions [Chu et al., FOCS '18]. In this paper, we give improved constructions of Eulerian sparsifiers, specifically: 1.

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) presents a critical global health challenge, and early detection is crucial for improving the 5-year survival rate. Recent medical imaging and computational algorithm advances offer potential solutions for early diagnosis. Deep learning, particularly in the form of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has demonstrated success in medical image analysis tasks, including classification and segmentation. However, the limited availability of clinical data for training purposes continues to provide a significant obstacle. Data augmentation, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and cross-validation are potential techniques to address this limitation and improve model performance, but effective solutions are still rare for 3D PDAC, where contrast is especially poor owing to the high heterogeneity in both tumor and background tissues. In this study, we developed a new GAN-based model, named 3DGAUnet, for generating realistic 3D CT images of PDAC tumors and pancreatic tissue, which can generate the interslice connection data that the existing 2D CT image synthesis models lack. Our innovation is to develop a 3D U-Net architecture for the generator to improve shape and texture learning for PDAC tumors and pancreatic tissue. Our approach offers a promising path to tackle the urgent requirement for creative and synergistic methods to combat PDAC. The development of this GAN-based model has the potential to alleviate data scarcity issues, elevate the quality of synthesized data, and thereby facilitate the progression of deep learning models to enhance the accuracy and early detection of PDAC tumors, which could profoundly impact patient outcomes. Furthermore, this model has the potential to be adapted to other types of solid tumors, hence making significant contributions to the field of medical imaging in terms of image processing models. ",

    "abstract": "Typically, multi-armed bandit (MAB) experiments are analyzed at the end of the study and thus require the analyst to specify a fixed sample size in advance. However, in many online learning applications, it is advantageous to continuously produce inference on the average treatment effect (ATE) between arms as new data arrive and determine a data-driven stopping time for the experiment. Existing work on continuous inference for adaptive experiments assumes that the treatment assignment probabilities are bounded away from zero and one, thus excluding nearly all standard bandit algorithms. In this work, we develop the Mixture Adaptive Design (MAD), a new experimental design for multi-armed bandits that enables continuous inference on the ATE with guarantees on statistical validity and power for nearly any bandit algorithm. On a high level, the MAD \"mixes\" a bandit algorithm of the user's choice with a Bernoulli design through a tuning parameter $\\delta_t$, where $\\delta_t$ is a deterministic sequence that controls the priority placed on the Bernoulli design as the sample size grows. We show that for $\\delta_t = o\\left(1/t^{1/4}\\right)$, the MAD produces a confidence sequence that is asymptotically valid and guaranteed to shrink around the true ATE. We empirically show that the MAD improves the coverage and power of ATE inference in MAB experiments without significant losses in finite-sample reward. ",

Diverse, extensive datasets are needed but are challenging to compile because of privacy, data collection limitations, and the progressive nature of KOA. However, a model capable of projecting genuine radiographs into different OA stages could augment data pools, enhance algorithm training, and offer pre-emptive prognostic insights. In this study, we trained a CycleGAN model to synthesize past and future stages of KOA on any genuine radiograph. The model was validated using a Convolutional Neural Network that was deceived into misclassifying disease stages in transformed images, demonstrating the CycleGAN's ability to effectively transform disease characteristics forward or backward in time. The model was particularly effective in synthesizing future disease states and showed an exceptional ability to retroactively transition late-stage radiographs to earlier stages by eliminating osteophytes and expanding knee joint space, signature characteristics of None or Doubtful KOA. The model's results signify a promising potential for enhancing diagnostic models, data augmentation, and educational and prognostic usage in healthcare. Nevertheless, further refinement, validation, and a broader evaluation process encompassing both CNN-based assessments and expert medical feedback are emphasized for future research and development.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the well-posedness and regularity of safe stabilizing optimization-based controllers for control-affine systems in the presence of model uncertainty. When the system dynamics contain unknown parameters, a finite set of samples can be used to formulate distributionally robust versions of control barrier function and control Lyapunov function constraints. Control synthesis with such distributionally robust constraints can be achieved by solving a (convex) second-order cone program (SOCP). We provide one necessary and two sufficient conditions to check the feasibility of such optimization problems, characterize their computational complexity and numerically show that they are significantly faster to check than direct use of SOCP solvers. Finally, we also analyze the regularity of the resulting control laws. ",

    "title": "Recurrent Dynamic Message Passing with Loops for Epidemics on Networks",
    "abstract": "Several theoretical methods have been developed to approximate prevalence and threshold of epidemics on networks. Among them, the recurrent dynamic message-passing (rDMP) theory offers a state-of-the-art performance by preventing the echo chamber effect in network edges. However, the rDMP theory was derived in an intuitive \\textit{ad-hoc} way, lacking a solid theoretical foundation and resulting in a probabilistic inconsistency flaw. Furthermore, real-world networks are clustered and full of local loops like triangles, whereas rDMP is based on the assumption of a locally tree-like network structure, which makes rDMP potentially inefficient on real applications. In this work, for the recurrent-state epidemics, we first demonstrate that the echo chamber effect exits not only in edges but also in local loops, which rDMP-like method can not avoid. We then correct the deficiency of rDMP in a principled manner, leading to the natural introduction of new \\textit{higher-order} dynamic messages, extending rDMP to handle local loops. By linearizing the extended message-passing equations, a new epidemic threshold estimation is given by the inverse of the leading eigenvalue of a matrix named \\textit{triangular non-backtracking} matrix. Numerical experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world networks to evaluate our method, the efficacy of which is validated in epidemic prevalence and threshold prediction tasks. In addition, our method has the potential to speed up the solution of the immunization, influence maximization, and robustness optimization problems in the networks. ",

Compared with X-ray images, CT images can provide more information, including multi-planar slices and three-dimensional structures for clinical diagnosis. However, CT imaging requires patients to be exposed to large doses of ionizing radiation for a long time, which may cause irreversible physical harm. In this paper, we propose an Uncertainty-aware MedNeRF (UMedNeRF) network based on generated radiation fields. The network can learn a continuous representation of CT projections from 2D X-ray images by obtaining the internal structure and depth information and using adaptive loss weights to ensure the quality of the generated images. Our model is trained on publicly available knee and chest datasets, and we show the results of CT projection rendering with a single X-ray and compare our method with other methods based on generated radiation fields.

    "abstract": "Predicting plasma evolution within a Tokamak reactor is crucial to realizing the goal of sustainable fusion. Capabilities in forecasting the spatio-temporal evolution of plasma rapidly and accurately allow us to quickly iterate over design and control strategies on current Tokamak devices and future reactors. Modelling plasma evolution using numerical solvers is often expensive, consuming many hours on supercomputers, and hence, we need alternative inexpensive surrogate models. We demonstrate accurate predictions of plasma evolution both in simulation and experimental domains using deep learning-based surrogate modelling tools, viz., Fourier Neural Operators (FNO). We show that FNO has a speedup of six orders of magnitude over traditional solvers in predicting the plasma dynamics simulated from magnetohydrodynamic models, while maintaining a high accuracy (MSE $\\approx$ $10^{-5}$). Our modified version of the FNO is capable of solving multi-variable Partial Differential Equations (PDE), and can capture the dependence among the different variables in a single model. FNOs can also predict plasma evolution on real-world experimental data observed by the cameras positioned within the MAST Tokamak, i.e., cameras looking across the central solenoid and the divertor in the Tokamak. We show that FNOs are able to accurately forecast the evolution of plasma and have the potential to be deployed for real-time monitoring. We also illustrate their capability in forecasting the plasma shape, the locations of interactions of the plasma with the central solenoid and the divertor for the full duration of the plasma shot within MAST. The FNO offers a viable alternative for surrogate modelling as it is quick to train and infer, and requires fewer data points, while being able to do zero-shot super-resolution and getting high-fidelity solutions.

    "abstract": "Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is a promising tool for detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) by imaging the retinal microvasculature. Ophthalmologists commonly use region-based analysis, such as the ETDRS grid, to study OCTA image biomarkers and understand the correlation with AD. However, existing studies have used general deep computer vision methods, which present challenges in providing interpretable results and leveraging clinical prior knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep-learning framework called Polar-Net. Our approach involves mapping OCTA images from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates, which allows for the use of approximate sector convolution and enables the implementation of the ETDRS grid-based regional analysis method commonly used in clinical practice. Furthermore, Polar-Net incorporates clinical prior information of each sector region into the training process, which further enhances its performance. Additionally, our framework adapts to acquire the importance of the corresponding retinal region, which helps researchers and clinicians understand the model's decision-making process in detecting AD and assess its conformity to clinical observations. Through evaluations on private and public datasets, we have demonstrated that Polar-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and provides more valuable pathological evidence for the association between retinal vascular changes and AD. In addition, we also show that the two innovative modules introduced in our framework have a significant impact on improving overall performance. ",

    "abstract": "Endoscopic imaging is commonly used to diagnose Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and classify its severity. It has been shown that deep learning based methods are effective in automated analysis of these images and can potentially be used to aid medical doctors. Unleashing the full potential of these methods depends on the availability of large amount of labeled images; however, obtaining and labeling these images are quite challenging. In this paper, we propose a active learning based generative augmentation method. The method involves generating a large number of synthetic samples by training using a small dataset consisting of real endoscopic images. The resulting data pool is narrowed down by using active learning methods to select the most informative samples, which are then used to train a classifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on a publicly available endoscopic image dataset. The results show that using synthesized samples in conjunction with active learning leads to improved classification performance compared to using only the original labeled examples and the baseline classification performance of 68.1% increases to 74.5% in terms of Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) Score. Another observation is that, attaining equivalent performance using only real data necessitated three times higher number of images. ",

    "abstract": "Diagnosing knee joint osteoarthritis (KOA), a major cause of disability worldwide, is challenging due to subtle radiographic indicators and the varied progression of the disease. Using deep learning for KOA diagnosis requires broad, comprehensive datasets. However, obtaining these datasets poses significant challenges due to patient privacy concerns and data collection restrictions. Additive data augmentation, which enhances data variability, emerges as a promising solution. Yet, it's unclear which augmentation techniques are most effective for KOA. This study explored various data augmentation methods, including adversarial augmentations, and their impact on KOA classification model performance. While some techniques improved performance, others commonly used underperformed. We identified potential confounding regions within the images using adversarial augmentation. This was evidenced by our models' ability to classify KL0 and KL4 grades accurately, with the knee joint omitted. This observation suggested a model bias, which might leverage unrelated features for classification currently present in radiographs. Interestingly, removing the knee joint also led to an unexpected improvement in KL1 classification accuracy. To better visualize these paradoxical effects, we employed Grad-CAM, highlighting the associated regions. Our study underscores the need for careful technique selection for improved model performance and identifying and managing potential confounding regions in radiographic KOA deep learning. ",

    "abstract": "Given the complex geometry of white matter streamlines, Autoencoders have been proposed as a dimension-reduction tool to simplify the analysis streamlines in a low-dimensional latent spaces. However, despite these recent successes, the majority of encoder architectures only perform dimension reduction on single streamlines as opposed to a full bundle of streamlines. This is a severe limitation of the encoder architecture that completely disregards the global geometric structure of streamlines at the expense of individual fibers. Moreover, the latent space may not be well structured which leads to doubt into their interpretability. In this paper we propose a novel Differentiable Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder, which are engineered to ingest entire bundles of streamlines as single data-point and provides reliable trustworthy encodings that can then be later used to analyze streamlines in the latent space. Comparisons with several state of the art Autoencoders demonstrate superior performance in both encoding and synthesis. ",
