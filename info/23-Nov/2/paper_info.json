    "abstract": "Tabular data is prevalent across various machine learning domains. Yet, the inherent heterogeneities in attribute and class spaces across different tabular datasets hinder the effective sharing of knowledge, limiting a tabular model to benefit from other datasets. In this paper, we propose Tabular data Pre-Training via Meta-representation (TabPTM), which allows one tabular model pre-training on a set of heterogeneous datasets. Then, this pre-trained model can be directly applied to unseen datasets that have diverse attributes and classes without additional training. Specifically, TabPTM represents an instance through its distance to a fixed number of prototypes, thereby standardizing heterogeneous tabular datasets. A deep neural network is then trained to associate these meta-representations with dataset-specific classification confidences, endowing TabPTM with the ability of training-free generalization. Experiments validate that TabPTM achieves promising performance in new datasets, even under few-shot scenarios. ",

Application marketplaces have introduced mechanisms to conform to regulations and provide individuals with control over their data.

In response to this challenge, this paper introduces a privacy quantification framework. The purpose of this framework is to systematically evaluate the level of privacy risk when using particular Android applications. The main goal is to provide individuals with qualitative labels to make informed decisions about their privacy.

Automated localization and classification of heart valves enables automatic extraction of quantities associated with heart mechanical function and related blood flow measurements. We propose a machine learning pipeline that uses deep neural networks for separate classification and localization steps. As the first step in the pipeline, we apply view classification to echocardiograms with ten unique anatomic views of the heart. In the second step, we apply deep learning-based object detection to both localize and identify the valves. Image segmentation based object detection in echocardiography has been shown in many earlier studies but, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that predicts the bounding boxes around the valves along with classification from 2D ultrasound images with the help of deep neural networks. Our object detection experiments applied to the Apical views suggest that it is possible to localize and identify multiple valves precisely. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have exhibited remarkable performance in various domains. However, the reliance of these models on spurious features has raised concerns about their reliability. A promising solution to this problem is last-layer retraining, which involves retraining the linear classifier head on a small subset of data without spurious cues. Nevertheless, selecting this subset requires human supervision, which reduces its scalability. Moreover, spurious cues may still exist in the selected subset. As a solution to this problem, we propose a novel ranking framework that leverages an open vocabulary object detection technique to identify images without spurious cues. More specifically, we use the object detector as a measure to score the presence of the target object in the images. Next, the images are sorted based on this score, and the last-layer of the model is retrained on a subset of the data with the highest scores. Our experiments on the ImageNet-1k dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of this ranking framework in sorting images based on spuriousness and using them for last-layer retraining. ",

Here we propose the multiscale causal backbone (MCB) of brain dynamics shared by a set of individuals across multiple temporal scales, and devise a principled methodology to extract it. Our approach leverages recent advances in multiscale causal structure learning and optimizes the trade-off between the model fitting and its complexity. Empirical assessment on synthetic data shows the superiority of our methodology over a baseline based on canonical functional connectivity networks. When applied to resting-state fMRI data, we find sparse MCBs for both the left and right brain hemispheres. Thanks to its multiscale nature, our approach shows that at low-frequency bands, causal dynamics are driven by brain regions associated with high-level cognitive functions; at higher frequencies instead, nodes related to sensory processing play a crucial role. Finally, our analysis of individual multiscale causal structures confirms the existence of a causal fingerprint of brain connectivity, thus supporting from a causal perspective the existing extensive research in brain connectivity fingerprinting.

    "abstract": "In elections around the world, the candidates may turn their campaigns toward negativity due to the prospect of failure and time pressure. In the digital age, social media platforms such as Twitter are rich sources of political discourse. Therefore, despite the large amount of data that is published on Twitter, the automatic system for campaign negativity detection can play an essential role in understanding the strategy of candidates and parties in their campaigns. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model for detecting campaign negativity consisting of a two-stage classifier that combines the strengths of two machine learning models. Here, we have collected Persian tweets from 50 political users, including candidates and government officials. Then we annotated 5,100 of them that were published during the year before the 2021 presidential election in Iran. In the proposed model, first, the required datasets of two classifiers based on the cosine similarity of tweet embeddings with axis embeddings (which are the average of embedding in positive and negative classes of tweets) from the training set (85\\%) are made, and then these datasets are considered the training set of the two classifiers in the hybrid model. Finally, our best model (RF-RF) was able to achieve 79\\% for the macro F1 score and 82\\% for the weighted F1 score. By running the best model on the rest of the tweets of 50 political users that were published one year before the election and with the help of statistical models, we find that the publication of a tweet by a candidate has nothing to do with the negativity of that tweet, and the presence of the names of political persons and political organizations in the tweet is directly related to its negativity.

However, the integration of FM in FL presents a new challenge, exposing the FL systems to potential threats. This paper investigates the robustness of FL incorporating FMs by assessing their susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Contrary to classic backdoor attacks against FL, the proposed attack (1) does not require the attacker fully involved in the FL process; (2) poses a significant risk in practical FL scenarios; (3) is able to evade existing robust FL frameworks/ FL backdoor defenses; (4) underscores the researches on the robustness of FL systems integrated with FMs. The effectiveness of the proposed attack is demonstrated by extensive experiments with various well-known models and benchmark datasets encompassing both text and image classification domains.

Our proposed models achieve good performance on the language modeling task, considerably surpassing the baseline model. In addition, we find that, interestingly, the fixation duration predicted by neural networks bears some resemblance to humans' fixation. Without any explicit guidance, the model makes similar choices to humans. We also investigate the reasons for the differences between them, which explain why \"model fixations\" are often more suitable than human fixations, when used to guide language models. ",

Previous works have designed various deep-learning methods using historical records to predict traffic accident occurrences. However, there is a lack of consensus on how accurate existing methods are, and a fundamental issue is the lack of public accident datasets for comprehensive evaluations. This paper constructs a large-scale, unified dataset of traffic accident records from official reports of various states in the US, totaling 9 million records, accompanied by road networks and traffic volume reports. Using this new dataset, we evaluate existing deep-learning methods for predicting the occurrence of accidents on road networks. Our main finding is that graph neural networks such as GraphSAGE can accurately predict the number of accidents on roads with less than 22% mean absolute error (relative to the actual count) and whether an accident will occur or not with over 87% AUROC, averaged over states. We achieve these results by using multitask learning to account for cross-state variabilities (e.g., availability of accident labels) and transfer learning to combine traffic volume with accident prediction. Ablation studies highlight the importance of road graph-structural features, amongst other features. Lastly, we discuss the implications of the analysis and develop a package for easily using our new dataset. ",

Given that physical sea ice models require high computational costs with complex parameterization, deep learning techniques can effectively replace the physical model and improve the performance of sea ice prediction. This study proposes a novel multi-task fully conventional network architecture named hierarchical information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) to predict daily SIC and SID. Instead of learning SIC and SID separately at each branch, we allow the SIC and SID layers to share their information and assist each other's prediction through the weighting attention modules (WAMs). Consequently, our HIS-Unet outperforms other statistical approaches, sea ice physical models, and neural networks without such information-sharing units. The improvement of HIS-Unet is obvious both for SIC and SID prediction when and where sea ice conditions change seasonally, which implies that the information sharing through WAMs allows the model to learn the sudden changes of SIC and SID. The weight values of the WAMs imply that SIC information plays a more critical role in SID prediction, compared to that of SID information in SIC prediction, and information sharing is more active in sea ice edges (seasonal sea ice) than in the central Arctic (multi-year sea ice).

Additionally, we propose novel strategies for autonomously generating adversarial training datasets, named Bot Adversarial Noisy Dialogue (BAND) datasets. These datasets are designed to fortify the safety classifier's robustness, and we investigate the consequences of incorporating adversarial examples into the training process. Through evaluations involving Large Language Models, we demonstrate that our classifier has the potential to decrease the attack success rate resulting from adversarial attacks by up to 60%.

We observe that existing object-based video recognition frameworks either assume the existence of in-domain supervised object detectors or follow a fully weakly-supervised pipeline to infer object locations from action labels. We propose to build object-centric video representations by leveraging visual-language pretrained models. This is achieved by \"object prompts\", an approach to extract task-specific object-centric representations from general-purpose pretrained models without finetuning. To recognize and predict human-object interactions, we use a Transformer-based neural architecture which allows the \"retrieval\" of relevant objects for action anticipation at various time scales.

We further introduce new objectives for adversarial attacks on ML-based downstream applications. The resilience of the attack to the existing widely used defense methods of adversarial training and perturbation signal subtraction is experimentally verified. For proof-of-concept evaluation, we build a real-time wireless attack platform using a software-defined radio system. Experimental results demonstrate that Magmaw causes significant performance degradation even in the presence of the defense mechanisms.

This paper explores the use of the Schwarz alternating method as a means to couple PINNs with each other and with conventional numerical models (i.e., full order models, or FOMs, obtained via the finite element, finite difference or finite volume methods) following a decomposition of the physical domain. It is well-known that training a PINN can be difficult when the PDE solution has steep gradients. We investigate herein the use of domain decomposition and the Schwarz alternating method as a means to accelerate the PINN training phase. Within this context, we explore different approaches for imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions within each subdomain PINN: weakly through the loss and/or strongly through a solution transformation. As a numerical example, we consider the one-dimensional steady state advection-diffusion equation in the advection-dominated (high Peclet) regime. Our results suggest that the convergence of the Schwarz method is strongly linked to the choice of boundary condition implementation within the PINNs being coupled. Surprisingly, strong enforcement of the Schwarz boundary conditions does not always lead to a faster convergence of the method. While it is not clear from our preliminary study that the PINN-PINN coupling via the Schwarz alternating method accelerates PINN convergence in the advection-dominated regime, it reveals that PINN training can be improved substantially for Peclet numbers as high as 1e6 by performing a PINN-FOM coupling.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the multi-agent cooperative exploration problem, which requires multiple agents to explore an unseen environment via sensory signals in a limited time. A popular approach to exploration tasks is to combine active mapping with planning. Metric maps capture the details of the spatial representation, but are with high communication traffic and may vary significantly between scenarios, resulting in inferior generalization. Topological maps are a promising alternative as they consist only of nodes and edges with abstract but essential information and are less influenced by the scene structures. However, most existing topology-based exploration tasks utilize classical methods for planning, which are time-consuming and sub-optimal due to their handcrafted design. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential for learning (near) optimal policies through fast end-to-end inference. In this paper, we propose Multi-Agent Neural Topological Mapping (MANTM) to improve exploration efficiency and generalization for multi-agent exploration tasks. MANTM mainly comprises a Topological Mapper and a novel RL-based Hierarchical Topological Planner (HTP). The Topological Mapper employs a visual encoder and distance-based heuristics to construct a graph containing main nodes and their corresponding ghost nodes. The HTP leverages graph neural networks to capture correlations between agents and graph nodes in a coarse-to-fine manner for effective global goal selection. Extensive experiments conducted in a physically-realistic simulator, Habitat, demonstrate that MANTM reduces the steps by at least 26.40% over planning-based baselines and by at least 7.63% over RL-based competitors in unseen scenarios.

However, MCE is very challenging as the number of maximal cliques may grow exponentially with the number of vertices. The state-of-the-art methods adopt a recursive paradigm to enumerate maximal cliques exhaustively, suffering from a large amount of redundant computation. In this paper, we propose a novel reduction-based framework for MCE, namely RMCE, that aims to reduce the search space and minimize unnecessary computations. The proposed framework RMCE incorporates three kinds of powerful reduction techniques including global reduction, dynamic reduction, and maximality check reduction. Global dynamic reduction techniques effectively reduce the size of the input graph and dynamically constructed subgraphs during the recursive subtasks, respectively. The maximality check reduction minimizes the computation for ensuring maximality by utilizing neighborhood dominance between visited vertices. Extensive experiments on 18 real graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Notably, it achieves speedups up to 4.81x compared to state-of-the-art approaches. ",

Most existing OSDA approaches, depending on the final image feature space of deep models, require manually-tuned thresholds, and may easily misclassify unknown samples as known classes. Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) could be a remedy. Within an MoE, different experts address different input features, producing unique expert routing patterns for different classes in a routing feature space. As a result, unknown class samples may also display different expert routing patterns to known classes. This paper proposes Dual-Space Detection, which exploits the inconsistencies between the image feature space and the routing feature space to detect unknown class samples without any threshold. Graph Router is further introduced to better make use of the spatial information among image patches.

    "abstract": "Infrared and visible image fusion aims to extract complementary features to synthesize a single fused image. Many methods employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract local features due to its translation invariance and locality. However, CNNs fail to consider the image's non-local self-similarity (NLss), though it can expand the receptive field by pooling operations, it still inevitably leads to information loss. In addition, the transformer structure extracts long-range dependence by considering the correlativity among all image patches, leading to information redundancy of such transformer-based methods. However, graph representation is more flexible than grid (CNN) or sequence (transformer structure) representation to address irregular objects, and graph can also construct the relationships among the spatially repeatable details or texture with far-space distance. Therefore, to address the above issues, it is significant to convert images into the graph space and thus adopt graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to extract NLss. This is because the graph can provide a fine structure to aggregate features and propagate information across the nearest vertices without introducing redundant information. Concretely, we implement a cascaded NLss extraction pattern to extract NLss of intra- and inter-modal by exploring interactions of different image pixels in intra- and inter-image positional distance. We commence by preforming GCNs on each intra-modal to aggregate features and propagate information to extract independent intra-modal NLss. Then, GCNs are performed on the concatenate intra-modal NLss features of infrared and visible images, which can explore the cross-domain NLss of inter-modal to reconstruct the fused image. Ablation studies and extensive experiments illustrates the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method on three datasets. ",

One of the main approaches to address this problem is to modify the loss function, often using regularization terms in addition to changing the type of adversarial losses. This paper focuses on directly regularizing the adversarial loss function. We propose a method that applies flooding, an overfitting suppression method in supervised learning, to GANs to directly prevent the discriminator's loss from becoming excessively low. Flooding requires tuning the flood level, but when applied to GANs, we propose that the appropriate range of flood level settings is determined by the adversarial loss function, supported by theoretical analysis of GANs using the binary cross entropy loss. We experimentally verify that flooding stabilizes GAN training and can be combined with other stabilization techniques. We also reveal that by restricting the discriminator's loss to be no greater than flood level, the training proceeds stably even when the flood level is somewhat high. ",

Graph clustering (i.e., dividing nodes into groups of similar ones) is a fundamental problem in graph analysis with applications in various fields. Recent studies have demonstrated that graph neural network (GNN) based approaches yield promising results for graph clustering. However, we observe that their performance degenerates significantly on graphs with noise edges, which are prevalent in practice. In this work, we propose MetaGC for robust GNN-based graph clustering. MetaGC employs a decomposable clustering loss function, which can be rephrased as a sum of losses over node pairs. We add a learnable weight to each node pair, and MetaGC adaptively adjusts the weights of node pairs using meta-weighting so that the weights of meaningful node pairs increase and the weights of less-meaningful ones (e.g., noise edges) decrease. We show empirically that MetaGC learns weights as intended and consequently outperforms the state-of-the-art GNN-based competitors, even when they are equipped with separate denoising schemes, on five real-world graphs under varying levels of noise.

    "abstract": "We study the distributed tracking model, also known as distributed functional monitoring. This model involves $k$ sites each receiving a stream of items and communicating with the central server. The server's task is to track a function of all items received thus far continuously, with minimum communication cost. For count tracking, it is known that there is a $\\sqrt{k}$ gap in communication between deterministic and randomized algorithms. However, existing randomized algorithms assume an \"oblivious adversary\" who constructs the entire input streams before the algorithm starts. Here we consider adaptive adversaries who can choose new items based on previous answers from the algorithm. Deterministic algorithms are trivially robust to adaptive adversaries, while randomized ones may not. Therefore, we investigate whether the $\\sqrt{k}$ advantage of randomized algorithms is from randomness itself or the oblivious adversary assumption. We provide an affirmative answer to this question by giving a robust algorithm with optimal communication. Existing robustification techniques do not yield optimal bounds due to the inherent challenges of the distributed nature of the problem. To address this, we extend the differential privacy framework by introducing \"partial differential privacy\" and proving a new generalization theorem. This theorem may have broader applications beyond robust count tracking, making it of independent interest. ",

In this paper, we rethink how to mine samples in contrastive learning, unlike other methods, our approach is more comprehensive, taking into account both positive and negative samples, and mining potential samples from two aspects: First, for positive samples, we consider both the augmented sample views obtained by data augmentation and the mined sample views through data mining. Then, we weight and combine them using both soft and hard weighting strategies. Second, considering the existence of uninformative negative samples and false negative samples in the negative samples, we analyze the negative samples from the gradient perspective and finally mine negative samples that are neither too hard nor too easy as potential negative samples, i.e., those negative samples that are close to positive samples. The experiments show the obvious advantages of our method compared with some traditional self-supervised methods. Our method achieves 88.57%, 61.10%, and 36.69% top-1 accuracy on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and TinyImagenet, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease is a global health challenge that requires early and accurate detection to improve patient outcomes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) holds significant diagnostic potential, but its effective analysis remains a formidable task. This study introduces a groundbreaking decentralized expert system that cleverly combines blockchain technology with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to integrate robust anomaly detection for patient-submitted data. Traditional diagnostic methods often lead to delayed and imprecise predictions, especially in the early stages of the disease. Centralized data repositories struggle to manage the immense volumes of MRI data, and persistent privacy concerns hinder collaborative efforts. Our innovative solution harnesses decentralization to protect data integrity and patient privacy, facilitated by blockchain technology. It not only emphasizes AI-driven MRI analysis but also incorporates a sophisticated data anomaly detection architecture. These mechanisms scrutinize patient-contributed data for various issues, including data quality problems and atypical findings within MRI images. Conducting an exhaustive check of MRI image correctness and quality directly on the blockchain is impractical due to computational complexity and cost constraints. Typically, such checks are performed off-chain, and the blockchain securely records the results. This comprehensive approach empowers our decentralized app to provide more precise early-stage Alzheimer's Disease predictions. By merging the strengths of blockchain, AI, and anomaly detection, our system represents a pioneering step towards revolutionizing disease diagnostics. ",

The method builds on recent developments in deep uncertainty quantification and generative modeling with normalizing flows. We apply our method to a synthetic data set that has been simulated using a mechanistic model from the mobility literature and several data sets simulated from interventional distributions induced by soft and atomic interventions on that model, and demonstrate that our method can reliably discern out-of-distribution data from in-distribution data. We compare the surjective flow model to a Dirichlet process mixture model and a bijective flow and find that the surjections are a crucial component to reliably distinguish in-distribution from out-of-distribution data.

We posit the \"generative shift hypothesis\": that generative AI will create qualitative and quantitative expansions in the traditional scope of end-user programming. We outline some reasons that traditional programming languages may still be relevant and useful for end-user programmers. We speculate whether each of these reasons might be fundamental and enduring, or whether they may disappear with further improvements and innovations in generative AI. Finally, we articulate a set of implications for end-user programming research, including the possibility of needing to revisit many well-established core concepts, such as Ko's learning barriers and Blackwell's attention investment model.

    "abstract": "Normal estimation for 3D point clouds is a fundamental task in 3D geometry processing. The state-of-the-art methods rely on priors of fitting local surfaces learned from normal supervision. However, normal supervision in benchmarks comes from synthetic shapes and is usually not available from real scans, thereby limiting the learned priors of these methods. In addition, normal orientation consistency across shapes remains difficult to achieve without a separate post-processing procedure. To resolve these issues, we propose a novel method for estimating oriented normals directly from point clouds without using ground truth normals as supervision. We achieve this by introducing a new paradigm for learning neural gradient functions, which encourages the neural network to fit the input point clouds and yield unit-norm gradients at the points. Specifically, we introduce loss functions to facilitate query points to iteratively reach the moving targets and aggregate onto the approximated surface, thereby learning a global surface representation of the data. Meanwhile, we incorporate gradients into the surface approximation to measure the minimum signed deviation of queries, resulting in a consistent gradient field associated with the surface. These techniques lead to our deep unsupervised oriented normal estimator that is robust to noise, outliers and density variations. Our excellent results on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method can learn more accurate normals for both unoriented and oriented normal estimation tasks than the latest methods.

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have shown to be amongst the most important artificial intelligence (AI) techniques in educational applications, providing adaptive educational services. However, their educational potential is limited in practice due to three major challenges: i) difficulty in incorporating symbolic educational knowledge (e.g., causal relationships, and practitioners' knowledge) in their development, ii) learning and reflecting biases, and iii) lack of interpretability. Given the high-risk nature of education, the integration of educational knowledge into ANNs becomes crucial for developing AI applications that adhere to essential educational restrictions, and provide interpretability over the predictions. This research argues that the neural-symbolic family of AI has the potential to address the named challenges. To this end, it adapts a neural-symbolic AI framework and accordingly develops an approach called NSAI, that injects and extracts educational knowledge into and from deep neural networks, for modelling learners computational thinking. Our findings reveal that the NSAI approach has better generalizability compared to deep neural networks trained merely on training data, as well as training data augmented by SMOTE and autoencoder methods. More importantly, unlike the other models, the NSAI approach prioritises robust representations that capture causal relationships between input features and output labels, ensuring safety in learning to avoid spurious correlations and control biases in training data. Furthermore, the NSAI approach enables the extraction of rules from the learned network, facilitating interpretation and reasoning about the path to predictions, as well as refining the initial educational knowledge. These findings imply that neural-symbolic AI can overcome the limitations of ANNs in education, enabling trustworthy and interpretable applications. ",

However, this approach often introduces side effects such as noise, availability issues, and low data quality, which in turn hinder the accurate modeling of user preferences and adversely impact recommendation performance. In light of the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), which possess extensive knowledge bases and strong reasoning capabilities, we propose a novel framework called LLMRec that enhances recommender systems by employing three simple yet effective LLM-based graph augmentation strategies. Our approach leverages the rich content available within online platforms (e.g., Netflix, MovieLens) to augment the interaction graph in three ways: (i) reinforcing user-item interaction egde, (ii) enhancing the understanding of item node attributes, and (iii) conducting user node profiling, intuitively from the natural language perspective. By employing these strategies, we address the challenges posed by sparse implicit feedback and low-quality side information in recommenders. Besides, to ensure the quality of the augmentation, we develop a denoised data robustification mechanism that includes techniques of noisy implicit feedback pruning and MAE-based feature enhancement that help refine the augmented data and improve its reliability. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis to support the effectiveness of LLMRec and clarify the benefits of our method in facilitating model optimization. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our LLM-based augmentation approach over state-of-the-art techniques.

    "abstract": "While multi-exit neural networks are regarded as a promising solution for making efficient inference via early exits, combating adversarial attacks remains a challenging problem. In multi-exit networks, due to the high dependency among different submodels, an adversarial example targeting a specific exit not only degrades the performance of the target exit but also reduces the performance of all other exits concurrently. This makes multi-exit networks highly vulnerable to simple adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose NEO-KD, a knowledge-distillation-based adversarial training strategy that tackles this fundamental challenge based on two key contributions. NEO-KD first resorts to neighbor knowledge distillation to guide the output of the adversarial examples to tend to the ensemble outputs of neighbor exits of clean data. NEO-KD also employs exit-wise orthogonal knowledge distillation for reducing adversarial transferability across different submodels. The result is a significantly improved robustness against adversarial attacks. Experimental results on various datasets/models show that our method achieves the best adversarial accuracy with reduced computation budgets, compared to the baselines relying on existing adversarial training or knowledge distillation techniques for multi-exit networks.

Using a simple word error rate (WER) heuristic, we select only the highest quality pseudo-labels for training. The distilled model is 5.8 times faster with 51% fewer parameters, while performing to within 1% WER on out-of-distribution test data in a zero-shot transfer setting.

To address this issue, we introduce bio-inspired event cameras and propose a novel Structure-aware Fusion Network (SFNet) that extracts sharp and complete object structures from the event stream to compensate for the lost information in images through cross-modality fusion, enabling the network to obtain illumination-robust representations for traffic object detection. Specifically, to mitigate the sparsity or blurriness issues arising from diverse motion states of traffic objects in fixed-interval event sampling methods, we propose the Reliable Structure Generation Network (RSGNet) to generate Speed Invariant Frames (SIF), ensuring the integrity and sharpness of object structures. Next, we design a novel Adaptive Feature Complement Module (AFCM) which guides the adaptive fusion of two modality features to compensate for the information loss in the images by perceiving the global lightness distribution of the images, thereby generating illumination-robust representations. Finally, considering the lack of large-scale and high-quality annotations in the existing event-based object detection datasets, we build a DSEC-Det dataset, which consists of 53 sequences with 63,931 images and more than 208,000 labels for 8 classes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SFNet can overcome the perceptual boundaries of conventional cameras and outperform the frame-based method by 8.0% in mAP50 and 5.9% in mAP50:95.

We provide an algorithm to decide whether such a drawing can be untangled, namely, if one can slide the vertices and edges of the graph on the surface (avoiding the obstacles) to remove all crossings; in other words, whether the drawing is homotopic to an embedding. While the problem boils down to planarity testing when the surface is the sphere or the disk (or equivalently the plane without any obstacle), the other cases have never been studied before, except when the input graph is a cycle, in an abundant literature in topology and more recently by Despr\\'e and Lazarus [SoCG 2017, J.

Our algorithm runs in O(m + poly(g+b) n log n) time, where g >= 0 and b >= 0 are the genus and the number of boundary components of the input orientable surface S, and n is the size of the input graph drawing, lying on some fixed graph of size m cellularly embedded on S. We use various techniques from two-dimensional computational topology and from the theory of hyperbolic surfaces. Most notably, we introduce reducing triangulations, a novel discrete analog of hyperbolic surfaces in the spirit of systems of quads by Lazarus and Rivaud [FOCS 2012] and Erickson and Whittlesey [SODA 2013], which have the additional benefit that reduced paths are unique and stable upon reversal; they are likely of independent interest.

Yet, this new type of deep neural network architecture is vulnerable to adversarial attacks limiting its capabilities in terms of robustness. This article presents a novel contribution aimed at further improving the accuracy and robustness of ViT, particularly in the face of adversarial attacks. We propose an augmentation technique called `Dynamic Scanning Augmentation' that leverages dynamic input sequences to adaptively focus on different patches, thereby maintaining performance and robustness. Our detailed investigations reveal that this adaptability to the input sequence induces significant changes in the attention mechanism of ViT, even for the same image. We introduce four variations of Dynamic Scanning Augmentation, outperforming ViT in terms of both robustness to adversarial attacks and accuracy against natural images, with one variant showing comparable results. By integrating our augmentation technique, we observe a substantial increase in ViT's robustness, improving it from $17\\%$ to $92\\%$ measured across different types of adversarial attacks. These findings, together with other comprehensive tests, indicate that Dynamic Scanning Augmentation enhances accuracy and robustness by promoting a more adaptive type of attention. In conclusion, this work contributes to the ongoing research on Vision Transformers by introducing Dynamic Scanning Augmentation as a technique for improving the accuracy and robustness of ViT. The observed results highlight the potential of this approach in advancing computer vision tasks and merit further exploration in future studies. ",

We pose the problem as a text-to-text generation problem and focus on the approach of fine-tuning a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate graphs. We propose an inductive bias which incorporates information about the structure of the graph into the LLM's generation process by incorporating message passing layers into an LLM's architecture. To evaluate our proposed method, we design a novel set of experiments using publicly available and widely studied molecule and knowledge graph data sets.

    "abstract": "This study delves into the intricate dynamics of trained deep neural networks and their relationships with network parameters. Trained networks predominantly continue training in a single direction, known as the drift mode. This drift mode can be explained by the quadratic potential model of the loss function, suggesting a slow exponential decay towards the potential minima. We unveil a correlation between Hessian eigenvectors and network weights. This relationship, hinging on the magnitude of eigenvalues, allows us to discern parameter directions within the network. Notably, the significance of these directions relies on two defining attributes: the curvature of their potential wells (indicated by the magnitude of Hessian eigenvalues) and their alignment with the weight vectors. Our exploration extends to the decomposition of weight matrices through singular value decomposition. This approach proves practical in identifying critical directions within the Hessian, considering both their magnitude and curvature. Furthermore, our examination showcases the applicability of principal component analysis in approximating the Hessian, with update parameters emerging as a superior choice over weights for this purpose. Remarkably, our findings unveil a similarity between the largest Hessian eigenvalues of individual layers and the entire network. Notably, higher eigenvalues are concentrated more in deeper layers. Leveraging these insights, we venture into addressing catastrophic forgetting, a challenge of neural networks when learning new tasks while retaining knowledge from previous ones. By applying our discoveries, we formulate an effective strategy to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, offering a possible solution that can be applied to networks of varying scales, including larger architectures.

Specifically, we employ a language-guided strategy and propose a simple-yet-effective architecture CLIP-AD, leveraging the superior zero-shot classification capabilities of the large vision-language model CLIP. A natural idea for anomaly segmentation is to directly calculate the similarity between text/image features, but we observe opposite predictions and irrelevant highlights in the results. Inspired by the phenomena, we introduce a Staged Dual-Path model (SDP) that effectively uses features from various levels and applies architecture and feature surgery to address these issues. Furthermore, delving beyond surface phenomena, we identify the problem arising from misalignment of text/image features in the joint embedding space. Thus, we introduce a fine-tuning strategy by adding linear layers and construct an extended model SDP+, further enhancing the performance. Abundant experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, e.g., on VisA, SDP outperforms SOTA by +1.0/+1.2 in classification/segmentation F1 scores, while SDP+ achieves +1.9/+11.7 improvements.

Most existing deep learning-based approaches attempt to remove the shadow directly, which can not deal with the shadow well. To handle this issue, we consider removing the shadow in a coarse-to-fine fashion and propose a simple but effective Progressive Recurrent Network (PRNet). The network aims to remove the shadow progressively, enabing us to flexibly adjust the number of iterations to strike a balance between performance and time. Our network comprises two parts: shadow feature extraction and progressive shadow removal. Specifically, the first part is a shallow ResNet which constructs the representations of the input shadow image on its original size, preventing the loss of high-frequency details caused by the downsampling operation. The second part has two critical components: the re-integration module and the update module. The proposed re-integration module can fully use the outputs of the previous iteration, providing input for the update module for further shadow removal. In this way, the proposed PRNet makes the whole process more concise and only uses 29% network parameters than the best published method. Extensive experiments on the three benchmarks, ISTD, ISTD+, and SRD, demonstrate that our method can effectively remove shadows and achieve superior performance. ",

In this paper, inspired by distributionally robust optimization (DRO) techniques, we address this shortcoming by proposing a group-aware distillation loss. During optimization, a set of weights is updated based on the per-group losses at a given iteration. This way, our method can dynamically focus on groups that have low performance during training. We empirically validate our method, GroupDistil on two benchmark datasets (natural images and cardiac MRIs) and show consistent improvement in terms of worst-group accuracy. ",

Part of the success has been attributed in prior work to their capability to model supra-segmental temporal information (SST), i.e., learn rhythmic-prosodic characteristics of speech in addition to spectral features. In this paper, we (i) present and apply a novel test to quantify to what extent the performance of state-of-the-art neural networks for speaker recognition can be explained by modeling SST; and (ii) present several means to force respective nets to focus more on SST and evaluate their merits. We find that a variety of CNN- and RNN-based neural network architectures for speaker recognition do not model SST to any sufficient degree, even when forced. The results provide a highly relevant basis for impactful future research into better exploitation of the full speech signal and give insights into the inner workings of such networks, enhancing explainability of deep learning for speech technologies.

    "abstract": "POI recommendation is practically important to facilitate various Location-Based Social Network services, and has attracted rising research attention recently. Existing works generally assume the available POI check-ins reported by users are the ground-truth depiction of user behaviors. However, in real application scenarios, the check-in data can be rather unreliable due to both subjective and objective causes including positioning error and user privacy concerns, leading to significant negative impacts on the performance of the POI recommendation. To this end, we investigate a novel problem of robust POI recommendation by considering the uncertainty factors of the user check-ins, and proposes a Bayes-enhanced Multi-view Attention Network. Specifically, we construct personal POI transition graph, the semantic-based POI graph and distance-based POI graph to comprehensively model the dependencies among the POIs. As the personal POI transition graph is usually sparse and sensitive to noise, we design a Bayes-enhanced spatial dependency learning module for data augmentation from the local view. A Bayesian posterior guided graph augmentation approach is adopted to generate a new graph with collaborative signals to increase the data diversity. Then both the original and the augmented graphs are used for POI representation learning to counteract the data uncertainty issue. Next, the POI representations of the three view graphs are input into the proposed multi-view attention-based user preference learning module. By incorporating the semantic and distance correlations of POIs, the user preference can be effectively refined and finally robust recommendation results are achieved. The results of extensive experiments show that BayMAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in POI recommendation when the available check-ins are incomplete and noisy. ",

However, the problem of false neighbors (i.e., neighbors that do not belong to the same category as the positive sample) is an objective but often overlooked challenge due to the query of neighbor samples without human supervision. In this paper, we present a simple Self-supervised learning framework called Mixed Nearest-Neighbors for Self-Supervised Learning (MNN). MNN optimizes the influence of neighbor samples on the semantics of positive samples through an intuitive weighting approach and image mixture operations. The results of our study demonstrate that MNN exhibits exceptional generalization performance and training efficiency on four benchmark datasets. ",

A causality-respecting PINN loss function is employed to overcome this limitation, effectively capturing the underlying physics.

We propose using solutions to similar problems instead of training from scratch by employing transfer learning while adhering to causality to accelerate convergence and ensure accurate results across diverse scenarios. Numerical experiments on the Euler-Bernoulli beam highlight the efficacy of the proposed approach for various initial conditions, including those with noise in the initial data. Furthermore, the potential of the proposed method is demonstrated for the Timoshenko beam in an extended spatial and temporal domain.

Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC), a second-order optimisation method, has shown promise to speed up neural network training and thereby reduce computational costs. However, there is currently no framework to apply it to generic architectures, specifically ones with linear weight-sharing layers. In this work, we identify two different settings of linear weight-sharing layers which motivate two flavours of K-FAC -- $\\textit{expand}$ and $\\textit{reduce}$.

Notably, K-FAC-reduce is generally faster than K-FAC-expand, which we leverage to speed up automatic hyperparameter selection via optimising the marginal likelihood for a Wide ResNet. Finally, we observe little difference between these two K-FAC variations when using them to train both a graph neural network and a vision transformer. However, both variations are able to reach a fixed validation metric target in $50$-$75\\%$ of the number of steps of a first-order reference run, which translates into a comparable improvement in wall-clock time.

We first introduce a Triangular Probability Similarity (TPS) constraint to guide the generated images toward clear and rainy images in the discriminator manifold, thereby minimizing artifacts and distortions during rain generation. Unlike conventional contrastive learning approaches, which indiscriminately push negative samples away from the anchors, we propose a Semantic Noise Contrastive Estimation (SeNCE) strategy and reassess the pushing force of negative samples based on the semantic similarity between the clear and the rainy images and the feature similarity between the anchor and the negative samples. Experiments demonstrate realistic rain generation with minimal artifacts and distortions, which benefits image deraining and object detection in rain. Furthermore, the method can be used to generate realistic snowy and night images, underscoring its potential for broader applicability. Code is available at https://github.com/ShenZheng2000/TPSeNCE.

    "abstract": "Convex function chasing (CFC) is an online optimization problem in which during each round $t$, a player plays an action $x_t$ in response to a hitting cost $f_t(x_t)$ and an additional cost of $c(x_t,x_{t-1})$ for switching actions. We study the CFC problem in stochastic and adversarial environments, giving algorithms that achieve performance guarantees simultaneously in both settings. Specifically, we consider the squared $\\ell_2$-norm switching costs and a broad class of quadratic hitting costs for which the sequence of minimizers either forms a martingale or is chosen adversarially. This is the first work that studies the CFC problem using a stochastic framework. We provide a characterization of the optimal stochastic online algorithm and, drawing a comparison between the stochastic and adversarial scenarios, we demonstrate that the adversarial-optimal algorithm exhibits suboptimal performance in the stochastic context. Motivated by this, we provide a best-of-both-worlds algorithm that obtains robust adversarial performance while simultaneously achieving near-optimal stochastic performance. ",

    "abstract": "To enable closed form conditioning, a common assumption in Gaussian process (GP) regression is independent and identically distributed Gaussian observation noise. This strong and simplistic assumption is often violated in practice, which leads to unreliable inferences and uncertainty quantification. Unfortunately, existing methods for robustifying GPs break closed-form conditioning, which makes them less attractive to practitioners and significantly more computationally expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate how to perform provably robust and conjugate Gaussian process (RCGP) regression at virtually no additional cost using generalised Bayesian inference. RCGP is particularly versatile as it enables exact conjugate closed form updates in all settings where standard GPs admit them. To demonstrate its strong empirical performance, we deploy RCGP for problems ranging from Bayesian optimisation to sparse variational Gaussian processes. ",

    "abstract": "The spatial and quantitative parameters of macular holes are vital for diagnosis, surgical choices, and post-op monitoring. Macular hole diagnosis and treatment rely heavily on spatial and quantitative data, yet the scarcity of such data has impeded the progress of deep learning techniques for effective segmentation and real-time 3D reconstruction. To address this challenge, we assembled the world's largest macular hole dataset, Retinal OCTfor Macular Hole Enhancement (ROME-3914), and a Comprehensive Archive for Retinal Segmentation (CARS-30k), both expertly annotated. In addition, we developed an innovative 3D segmentation network, the Dual-Encoder FuGH Network (DEFN), which integrates three innovative modules: Fourier Group Harmonics (FuGH), Simplified 3D Spatial Attention (S3DSA) and Harmonic Squeeze-and-Excitation Module (HSE). These three modules synergistically filter noise, reduce computational complexity, emphasize detailed features, and enhance the network's representation ability. We also proposed a novel data augmentation method, Stochastic Retinal Defect Injection (SRDI), and a network optimization strategy DynamicWeightCompose (DWC), to further improve the performance of DEFN. Compared with 13 baselines, our DEFN shows the best performance. We also offer precise 3D retinal reconstruction and quantitative metrics, bringing revolutionary diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making tools for ophthalmologists, and is expected to completely reshape the diagnosis and treatment patterns of difficult-to-treat macular degeneration.

    "title": "A Robust Deep Learning Method with Uncertainty Estimation for the  Pathological Classification of Renal Cell Carcinoma based on CT Images",
    "abstract": "Objectives To develop and validate a deep learning-based diagnostic model incorporating uncertainty estimation so as to facilitate radiologists in the preoperative differentiation of the pathological subtypes of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) based on CT images. Methods Data from 668 consecutive patients, pathologically proven RCC, were retrospectively collected from Center 1. By using five-fold cross-validation, a deep learning model incorporating uncertainty estimation was developed to classify RCC subtypes into clear cell RCC (ccRCC), papillary RCC (pRCC), and chromophobe RCC (chRCC). An external validation set of 78 patients from Center 2 further evaluated the model's performance. Results In the five-fold cross-validation, the model's area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the classification of ccRCC, pRCC, and chRCC was 0.868 (95% CI: 0.826-0.923), 0.846 (95% CI: 0.812-0.886), and 0.839 (95% CI: 0.802-0.88), respectively. In the external validation set, the AUCs were 0.856 (95% CI: 0.838-0.882), 0.787 (95% CI: 0.757-0.818), and 0.793 (95% CI: 0.758-0.831) for ccRCC, pRCC, and chRCC, respectively. Conclusions The developed deep learning model demonstrated robust performance in predicting the pathological subtypes of RCC, while the incorporated uncertainty emphasized the importance of understanding model confidence, which is crucial for assisting clinical decision-making for patients with renal tumors. Clinical relevance statement Our deep learning approach, integrated with uncertainty estimation, offers clinicians a dual advantage: accurate RCC subtype predictions complemented by diagnostic confidence references, promoting informed decision-making for patients with RCC.

When there are latent variables, the problem becomes even more difficult. In this paper, we first propose a DAG structure recovering algorithm, which is based on the Cholesky factorization of the covariance matrix of the observed data. The algorithm is fast and easy to implement and has theoretical grantees for exact recovery. On synthetic and real-world datasets, the algorithm is significantly faster than previous methods and achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, under the equal error variances assumption, we incorporate an optimization procedure into the Cholesky factorization based algorithm to handle the DAG recovering problem with latent variables. Numerical simulations show that the modified \"Cholesky + optimization\" algorithm is able to recover the ground truth graph in most cases and outperforms existing algorithms. ",

In this paper, we introduce nonlinear solver strategies to more robustly and efficiently compute high-speed viscous flows. Specifically, we incorporate an anisotropic grid regularization based on the mesh-implied metric into the nonlinear least-squares solver that inhibits grid motion in directions with small element length scales. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive elementwise regularization strategy that locally scales the regularization terms as needed to maintain grid validity. We apply the proposed MDG-ICE formulation to test cases involving viscous shocks and/or boundary layers, including Mach 17.6 hypersonic viscous flow over a circular cylinder and Mach 5 hypersonic viscous flow over a sphere, which are very challenging test cases for conventional numerical schemes on simplicial grids. Even without artificial dissipation, the computed solutions are free from spurious oscillations and yield highly symmetric surface heat-flux profiles. ",
