    "abstract": "The strength of a supply chain is an important measure of a country's or region's technical advancement and overall competitiveness. Establishing supply chain risk assessment models for effective management and mitigation of potential risks has become increasingly crucial. As the number of businesses grows, the important relationships become more complicated and difficult to measure. This emphasizes the need of extracting relevant information from graph data. Previously, academics mostly employed knowledge inference to increase the visibility of links between nodes in the supply chain. However, they have not solved the data hunger problem of single node feature characteristics. We propose a hierarchical knowledge transferable graph neural network-based (HKTGNN) supply chain risk assessment model to address these issues. Our approach is based on current graph embedding methods for assessing corporate investment risk assessment. We embed the supply chain network corresponding to individual goods in the supply chain using the graph embedding module, resulting in a directed homogeneous graph with just product nodes. This reduces the complicated supply chain network into a basic product network. It addresses difficulties using the domain difference knowledge transferable module based on centrality, which is presented by the premise that supply chain feature characteristics may be biased in the actual world. Meanwhile, the feature complement and message passing will alleviate the data hunger problem, which is driven by domain differences. Our model outperforms in experiments on a real-world supply chain dataset. We will give an equation to prove that our comparative experiment is both effective and fair. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a rapid development of spatio-temporal prediction techniques in response to the increasing demands of traffic management and travel planning. While advanced end-to-end models have achieved notable success in improving predictive performance, their integration and expansion pose significant challenges. This work aims to address these challenges by introducing a spatio-temporal pre-training framework that seamlessly integrates with downstream baselines and enhances their performance. The framework is built upon two key designs: (i) We propose a spatio-temporal mask autoencoder as a pre-training model for learning spatio-temporal dependencies. The model incorporates customized parameter learners and hierarchical spatial pattern encoding networks. These modules are specifically designed to capture spatio-temporal customized representations and intra- and inter-cluster region semantic relationships, which have often been neglected in existing approaches. (ii) We introduce an adaptive mask strategy as part of the pre-training mechanism. This strategy guides the mask autoencoder in learning robust spatio-temporal representations and facilitates the modeling of different relationships, ranging from intra-cluster to inter-cluster, in an easy-to-hard training manner. Extensive experiments conducted on representative benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We have made our model implementation publicly available at https://github.com/HKUDS/GPT-ST. ",

    "abstract": "The goal of knowledge graph completion (KGC) is to predict missing links in a KG using trained facts that are already known. In recent, pre-trained language model (PLM) based methods that utilize both textual and structural information are emerging, but their performances lag behind state-of-the-art (SOTA) structure-based methods or some methods lose their inductive inference capabilities in the process of fusing structure embedding to text encoder. In this paper, we propose a novel method to effectively unify structure information and language semantics without losing the power of inductive reasoning. We adopt entity anchors and these anchors and textual description of KG elements are fed together into the PLM-based encoder to learn unified representations. In addition, the proposed method utilizes additional random negative samples which can be reused in the each mini-batch during contrastive learning to learn a generalized entity representations. We verify the effectiveness of the our proposed method through various experiments and analysis. The experimental results on standard benchmark widely used in link prediction task show that the proposed model outperforms existing the SOTA KGC models. Especially, our method show the largest performance improvement on FB15K-237, which is competitive to the SOTA of structure-based KGC methods. ",

    "abstract": "Most deep neural networks are trained under fixed network architectures and require retraining when the architecture changes. If expanding the network's size is needed, it is necessary to retrain from scratch, which is expensive. To avoid this, one can grow from a small network by adding random weights over time to gradually achieve the target network size. However, this naive approach falls short in practice as it brings too much noise to the growing process. Prior work tackled this issue by leveraging the already learned weights and training data for generating new weights through conducting a computationally expensive analysis step. In this paper, we introduce MixtureGrowth, a new approach to growing networks that circumvents the initialization overhead in prior work. Before growing, each layer in our model is generated with a linear combination of parameter templates. Newly grown layer weights are generated by using a new linear combination of existing templates for a layer. On one hand, these templates are already trained for the task, providing a strong initialization. On the other, the new coefficients provide flexibility for the added layer weights to learn something new. We show that our approach boosts top-1 accuracy over the state-of-the-art by 2-2.5% on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, while achieving comparable performance with fewer FLOPs to a larger network trained from scratch.

It aligns with predictive maintenance in modern industry, minimizing downtime and costs by addressing potential structural issues. Various machine learning techniques have been used to extract valuable information from vibration data, often relying on prior structural knowledge. This research introduces an innovative approach to structural damage detection, utilizing a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm. In order to extract deep spatial features from time series data, CNNs are taught to recognize long-term temporal connections. This methodology combines spatial and temporal features, enhancing discrimination capabilities when compared to methods solely reliant on deep spatial features. Time series data are divided into two categories using the proposed neural network: undamaged and damaged. To validate its efficacy, the method's accuracy was tested using a benchmark dataset derived from a three-floor structure at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The outcomes show that the new CNN algorithm is very accurate in spotting structural degradation in the examined structure. ",

While existing foundation models yield impressive results in many NLP tasks requiring reasoning, it is unclear whether they understand the complexity of the underlying network of causal relationships of events in narratives. In this work, we present CRAB, a new Causal Reasoning Assessment Benchmark designed to evaluate causal understanding of events in real-world narratives. CRAB contains fine-grained, contextual causality annotations for ~2.7K pairs of real-world events that describe various newsworthy event timelines (e.g., the acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk). Using CRAB, we measure the performance of several large language models, demonstrating that most systems achieve poor performance on the task. Motivated by classical causal principles, we also analyze the causal structures of groups of events in CRAB, and find that models perform worse on causal reasoning when events are derived from complex causal structures compared to simple linear causal chains.

However, despite their potential, their integration into neural solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) remains largely unexplored. We explore the integration of PDE symmetries, known as Lie point symmetries, in a major family of neural solvers known as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We propose a loss function that informs the network about Lie point symmetries in the same way that PINN models try to enforce the underlying PDE through a loss function. Intuitively, our symmetry loss ensures that the infinitesimal generators of the Lie group conserve the PDE solutions. Effectively, this means that once the network learns a solution, it also learns the neighbouring solutions generated by Lie point symmetries. Empirical evaluations indicate that the inductive bias introduced by the Lie point symmetries of the PDEs greatly boosts the sample efficiency of PINNs. ",

Swiftly identifying tumor tissue for removal could increase surgical outcomes. The TumorID is a laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy device that utilizes endogenous fluorophores such as NADH and FAD to detect tumor regions. With the goal of creating an endoscopic tool for intraoperative tumor detection in mind, a study of the TumorID was conducted to assess how the angle of incidence (AoI) affects the collected spectral response of the scanned tumor. For this study, flat and convex NADH/FAD gellan gum phantoms were scanned at various AoI (a range of 36 degrees) to observe the spectral behavior. Results showed that spectral signature did not change significantly across flat and convex phantoms, and the Area under Curve (AUC) values calculated for each spectrum had a standard deviation of 0.02 and 0.01 for flat and convex phantoms, respectively. Therefore, the study showed that AoI will affect the intensity of the spectral response, but the peaks representative of the endogenous fluorophores are still observable and similar. Future work includes conducting an AoI study with a longer working-distance lens, then incorporating said lens to design an endoscopic, intraoperative tumor detection device for minimally invasive surgery, with first applications in endonasal endoscopic approaches for pituitary tumors.

    "abstract": "The densest subgraph problem has received significant attention, both in theory and in practice, due to its applications in problems such as community detection, social network analysis, and spam detection. Due to the high cost of obtaining exact solutions, much attention has focused on designing approximate densest subgraph algorithms. However, existing approaches are not able to scale to massive graphs with billions of edges. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that combines approximate densest subgraph algorithms with a pruning optimization. We design new parallel variants of the state-of-the-art sequential Greedy++ algorithm, and plug it into our framework in conjunction with a parallel pruning technique based on $k$-core decomposition to obtain parallel $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate densest subgraph algorithms. On a single thread, our algorithms achieve $2.6$--$34\\times$ speedup over Greedy++, and obtain up to $22.37\\times$ self relative parallel speedup on a 30-core machine with two-way hyper-threading. Compared with the state-of-the-art parallel algorithm by Harb et al. [NeurIPS'22], we achieve up to a $114\\times$ speedup on the same machine. Finally, against the recent sequential algorithm of Xu et al. [PACMMOD'23], we achieve up to a $25.9\\times$ speedup. The scalability of our algorithms enables us to obtain near-optimal density statistics on the hyperlink2012 (with roughly 113 billion edges) and clueweb (with roughly 37 billion edges) graphs for the first time in the literature.

FedL ignores two important characteristics of contemporary wireless networks, however: (i) the network may contain heterogeneous communication/computation resources, and (ii) there may be significant overlaps in devices' local data distributions. In this work, we develop a novel optimization methodology that jointly accounts for these factors via intelligent device sampling complemented by device-to-device (D2D) offloading. Our optimization methodology aims to select the best combination of sampled nodes and data offloading configuration to maximize FedL training accuracy while minimizing data processing and D2D communication resource consumption subject to realistic constraints on the network topology and device capabilities. Theoretical analysis of the D2D offloading subproblem leads to new FedL convergence bounds and an efficient sequential convex optimizer. Using these results, we develop a sampling methodology based on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) which learns the relationship between network attributes, sampled nodes, and D2D data offloading to maximize FedL accuracy. Through evaluation on popular datasets and real-world network measurements from our edge testbed, we find that our methodology outperforms popular device sampling methodologies from literature in terms of ML model performance, data processing overhead, and energy consumption.

We propose a new analysis technique -- circuit probing -- that automatically uncovers low-level circuits that compute hypothesized intermediate variables. This enables causal analysis through targeted ablation at the level of model parameters. We apply this method to models trained on simple arithmetic tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness at (1) deciphering the algorithms that models have learned, (2) revealing modular structure within a model, and (3) tracking the development of circuits over training. We compare circuit probing to other methods across these three experiments, and find it on par or more effective than existing analysis methods.

The use and collection of users' data in experiments often involve sensitive personal information, so additional measures to protect individual privacy are required during data collection, storage, and usage. In this work, we focus on the rigorous protection of users' privacy (under the notion of differential privacy (DP)) while minimizing the trust toward service providers. Specifically, we consider the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE) under DP, while only allowing the analyst to collect population-level statistics via secure aggregation, a distributed protocol enabling a service provider to aggregate information without accessing individual data. Although a vital component in modern A/B testing workflows, private distributed experimentation has not previously been studied. To achieve DP, we design local privatization mechanisms that are compatible with secure aggregation and analyze the utility, in terms of the width of confidence intervals, both asymptotically and non-asymptotically. We show how these mechanisms can be scaled up to handle the very large number of participants commonly found in practice. In addition, when introducing DP noise, it is imperative to cleverly split privacy budgets to estimate both the mean and variance of the outcomes and carefully calibrate the confidence intervals according to the DP noise. Last, we present comprehensive experimental evaluations of our proposed schemes and show the privacy-utility trade-offs in experiment design. ",

Annotating large-scale image data for 3D detection is resource-intensive and time-consuming. Recently, pretrained large image diffusion models have become prominent as effective feature extractors for 2D perception tasks. However, these features are initially trained on paired text and image data, which are not optimized for 3D tasks, and often exhibit a domain gap when applied to the target data. Our approach bridges these gaps through two specialized tuning strategies: geometric and semantic. For geometric tuning, we fine-tune a diffusion model to perform novel view synthesis conditioned on a single image, by introducing a novel epipolar warp operator. This task meets two essential criteria: the necessity for 3D awareness and reliance solely on posed image data, which are readily available (e.g., from videos) and does not require manual annotation. For semantic refinement, we further train the model on target data with detection supervision. Both tuning phases employ ControlNet to preserve the integrity of the original feature capabilities. In the final step, we harness these enhanced capabilities to conduct a test-time prediction ensemble across multiple virtual viewpoints. Through our methodology, we obtain 3D-aware features that are tailored for 3D detection and excel in identifying cross-view point correspondences. Consequently, our model emerges as a powerful 3D detector, substantially surpassing previous benchmarks, e.g., Cube-RCNN, a precedent in single-view 3D detection by 9.43\\% in AP3D on the Omni3D-ARkitscene dataset.

    "abstract": "Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) protocols enable secure evaluation of a circuit by several parties, even in the presence of an adversary who maliciously corrupts all but one of the parties. These MPC protocols are constructed using the well-known secret-sharing-based paradigm (SPDZ and SPDZ2k), where the protocols ensure security against a malicious adversary by computing Message Authentication Code (MAC) tags on the input shares and then evaluating the circuit with these input shares and tags. However, this tag computation adds a significant runtime overhead, particularly for machine learning (ML) applications with numerous linear computation layers such as convolutions and fully connected layers. To alleviate the tag computation overhead, we introduce CompactTag, a lightweight algorithm for generating MAC tags specifically tailored for linear layers in ML. Linear layer operations in ML, including convolutions, can be transformed into Toeplitz matrix multiplications. For the multiplication of two matrices with dimensions T1 x T2 and T2 x T3 respectively, SPDZ2k required O(T1 x T2 x T3) local multiplications for the tag computation. In contrast, CompactTag only requires O(T1 x T2 + T1 x T3 + T2 x T3) local multiplications, resulting in a substantial performance boost for various ML models. We empirically compared our protocol to the SPDZ2k protocol for various ML circuits, including ResNet Training-Inference, Transformer Training-Inference, and VGG16 Training-Inference. SPDZ2k dedicated around 30% of its online runtime for tag computation. CompactTag speeds up this tag computation bottleneck by up to 23x, resulting in up to 1.47x total online phase runtime speedups for various ML workloads. ",

    "title": "Reusing Convolutional Neural Network Models through Modularization and  Composition",
    "abstract": "With the widespread success of deep learning technologies, many trained deep neural network (DNN) models are now publicly available. However, directly reusing the public DNN models for new tasks often fails due to mismatching functionality or performance. Inspired by the notion of modularization and composition in software reuse, we investigate the possibility of improving the reusability of DNN models in a more fine-grained manner. Specifically, we propose two modularization approaches named CNNSplitter and GradSplitter, which can decompose a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model for $N$-class classification into $N$ small reusable modules. Each module recognizes one of the $N$ classes and contains a part of the convolution kernels of the trained CNN model. Then, the resulting modules can be reused to patch existing CNN models or build new CNN models through composition. The main difference between CNNSplitter and GradSplitter lies in their search methods: the former relies on a genetic algorithm to explore search space, while the latter utilizes a gradient-based search method. Our experiments with three representative CNNs on three widely-used public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Compared with CNNSplitter, GradSplitter incurs less accuracy loss, produces much smaller modules (19.88% fewer kernels), and achieves better results on patching weak models. In particular, experiments on GradSplitter show that (1) by patching weak models, the average improvement in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score is 17.13%, 4.95%, and 11.47%, respectively, and (2) for a new task, compared with the models trained from scratch, reusing modules achieves similar accuracy (the average loss of accuracy is only 2.46%) without a costly training process. Our approaches provide a viable solution to the rapid development and improvement of CNN models. ",

    "abstract": "Resource leaks, caused by resources not being released after acquisition, often lead to performance issues and system crashes. Existing static detection techniques rely on mechanical matching of predefined resource acquisition/release APIs, posing challenges to their effectiveness, including completeness of predefined APIs, identification of reachability validation, and analysis complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose InferROI, a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to directly infer resource-oriented intentions (acquisition, release, and reachability validation) in code, based on resource management knowledge and code context understanding, rather than mechanical API matching. InferROI uses a prompt to instruct the LLM in inferring involved intentions from a given code snippet, which are then translated into formal expressions. By aggregating these inferred intentions, InferROI utilizes a lightweight static-analysis based algorithm to analyze control-flow paths extracted from the code, thereby detecting resource leaks. We evaluate InferROI on Java program and investigate its effectiveness in both resource-oriented intention inference and resource leak detection. Experimental results demonstrate that InferROI achieves a precision of 74.6% and a recall of 81.8% in intention inference on 172 code snippets from the DroidLeaks dataset. Additionally, InferROI covers a significant portion of concerned Android resources listed in the dataset. When applied to 86 bugs from the DroidLeaks dataset, InferROI exhibits a high bug detection rate (53.5%) and a low false alarm rate (8.1%) compared to eight baseline detectors. Moreover, we apply InferROI to resource leak detection in 100 methods from real-world open-source projects, where it identifies 12 unknown resource leak bugs, with 7 of them being confirmed by developers.

Any technological interventions to address these common occurrences need to be built on an understanding of the nature of social discomfort in vehicles. This paper contributes fine-grained empirical analysis and a proposed definition and categorization of the problem of social discomfort in cars to the HCI literature. We recorded nine families going on drives and performed interaction analysis on this data. Discomfort in the car could be divided into (1) local and full-body physical discomfort and (2) individual, social, or cognitive-load-related psychological discomfort. We define three strategies to address discomfort: contextual mediation, social mediation, and social support. We discuss three video excerpts in detail to illustrate the mitigation strategies. This work lays the foundation for the design of interactive vehicular systems for mitigating social discomfort. ",

    "abstract": "The accessibility of spatially distributed data, enabled by affordable sensors, field, and numerical experiments, has facilitated the development of data-driven solutions for scientific problems, including climate change, weather prediction, and urban planning. Neural Partial Differential Equations (Neural PDEs), which combine deep learning (DL) techniques with domain expertise (e.g., governing equations) for parameterization, have proven to be effective in capturing valuable correlations within spatiotemporal datasets. However, sparse and noisy measurements coupled with modeling approximation introduce aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Therefore, quantifying uncertainties propagated from model inputs to outputs remains a challenge and an essential goal for establishing the trustworthiness of Neural PDEs. This work evaluates various Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) approaches for both Forward and Inverse Problems in scientific applications. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of Bayesian methods, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and a more conventional approach, Deep Ensembles (DE). To illustrate their performance, we take two canonical PDEs: Burger's equation and the Navier-Stokes equation. Our results indicate that Neural PDEs can effectively reconstruct flow systems and predict the associated unknown parameters. However, it is noteworthy that the results derived from Bayesian methods, based on our observations, tend to display a higher degree of certainty in their predictions as compared to those obtained using the DE. This elevated certainty in predictions suggests that Bayesian techniques might underestimate the true underlying uncertainty, thereby appearing more confident in their predictions than the DE approach.

Employing graph neural networks to capture structural patterns from syntactic dependency parsing has been confirmed as an effective approach for boosting ABSA. In most works, the topology of dependency trees or dependency-based attention coefficients is often loosely regarded as edges between aspects and opinions, which can result in insufficient and ambiguous syntactic utilization. To address these problems, we propose a new reinforced dependency graph convolutional network (RDGCN) that improves the importance calculation of dependencies in both distance and type views. Initially, we propose an importance calculation criterion for the minimum distances over dependency trees. Under the criterion, we design a distance-importance function that leverages reinforcement learning for weight distribution search and dissimilarity control. Since dependency types often do not have explicit syntax like tree distances, we use global attention and mask mechanisms to design type-importance functions. Finally, we merge these weights and implement feature aggregation and classification. Comprehensive experiments on three popular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the criterion and importance functions. RDGCN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN-based baselines in all validations.

In order to enhance the level of visual comprehension, recent studies have equipped LMMs with region-level understanding capabilities by representing object bounding box coordinates as a series of text sequences (pixel2seq). In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm for object location modeling called pixel2emb method, where we ask the LMM to output the location embeddings and then decoded by different decoders. This paradigm allows for different location formats (such as bounding boxes and masks) to be used in multimodal conversations Furthermore, this kind of embedding based location modeling enables the utilization of existing practices in localization tasks, such as detection and segmentation. In scenarios with limited resources, our pixel2emb demonstrates superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in both the location input and output tasks under fair comparison. Leveraging the proposed pixel2emb method, we train an LMM named NExT-Chat and demonstrate its capability of handling multiple tasks like visual grounding, region caption, and grounded reasoning. ",

However, the robustness of these models remains scarcely explored. Contrary to computer vision, there is to date no realistic protocol to properly evaluate the adversarial robustness of deep tabular models due to intrinsic properties of tabular data such as categorical features, immutability, and feature relationship constraints. To fill this gap, we propose CAA, the first efficient evasion attack for constrained tabular deep learning models. CAA is an iterative parameter-free attack that combines gradient and search attacks to generate adversarial examples under constraints. We leverage CAA to build a benchmark of deep tabular models across three popular use cases: credit scoring, phishing and botnet attacks detection. Our benchmark supports ten threat models with increasing capabilities of the attacker, and reflects real-world attack scenarios for each use case. Overall, our results demonstrate how domain knowledge, adversarial training, and attack budgets impact the robustness assessment of deep tabular models and provide security practitioners with a set of recommendations to improve the robustness of deep tabular models against various evasion attack scenarios.

    "abstract": "Emotion recognition is a crucial task for human conversation understanding. It becomes more challenging with the notion of multimodal data, e.g., language, voice, and facial expressions. As a typical solution, the global- and the local context information are exploited to predict the emotional label for every single sentence, i.e., utterance, in the dialogue. Specifically, the global representation could be captured via modeling of cross-modal interactions at the conversation level. The local one is often inferred using the temporal information of speakers or emotional shifts, which neglects vital factors at the utterance level. Additionally, most existing approaches take fused features of multiple modalities in an unified input without leveraging modality-specific representations. Motivating from these problems, we propose the Relational Temporal Graph Neural Network with Auxiliary Cross-Modality Interaction (CORECT), an novel neural network framework that effectively captures conversation-level cross-modality interactions and utterance-level temporal dependencies with the modality-specific manner for conversation understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CORECT via its state-of-the-art results on the IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI datasets for the multimodal ERC task. ",

Firstly, we employ different spatial-temporal encoders to embed the decomposed position vectors and the current position of each scene, providing rich features for the subsequent cross-temporal aggregation. Secondly, the relative interaction and cross-temporal aggregation strategies are sequentially adopted to integrate features in the current fusion module, observation interaction module, future feedback module and global fusion module, in which the future feedback module can enable the understanding of pre-action by feeding the influence of preview information to feedforward prediction. Thirdly, the comprehensive interaction features are further fed into final predictor to generate the joint predicted trajectories of multiple agents.

    "abstract": "We introduce an improved solution to the neural image-based rendering problem in computer vision. Given a set of images taken from a freely moving camera at train time, the proposed approach could synthesize a realistic image of the scene from a novel viewpoint at test time. The key ideas presented in this paper are (i) Recovering accurate camera parameters via a robust pipeline from unposed day-to-day images is equally crucial in neural novel view synthesis problem; (ii) It is rather more practical to model object's content at different resolutions since dramatic camera motion is highly likely in day-to-day unposed images. To incorporate the key ideas, we leverage the fundamentals of scene rigidity, multi-scale neural scene representation, and single-image depth prediction. Concretely, the proposed approach makes the camera parameters as learnable in a neural fields-based modeling framework. By assuming per view depth prediction is given up to scale, we constrain the relative pose between successive frames. From the relative poses, absolute camera pose estimation is modeled via a graph-neural network-based multiple motion averaging within the multi-scale neural-fields network, leading to a single loss function. Optimizing the introduced loss function provides camera intrinsic, extrinsic, and image rendering from unposed images. We demonstrate, with examples, that for a unified framework to accurately model multiscale neural scene representation from day-to-day acquired unposed multi-view images, it is equally essential to have precise camera-pose estimates within the scene representation framework. Without considering robustness measures in the camera pose estimation pipeline, modeling for multi-scale aliasing artifacts can be counterproductive.

    "title": "A Comprehensive Summarization and Evaluation of Feature Refinement  Modules for CTR Prediction",
    "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is widely used in academia and industry. Most CTR tasks fall into a feature embedding \\& feature interaction paradigm, where the accuracy of CTR prediction is mainly improved by designing practical feature interaction structures. However, recent studies have argued that the fixed feature embedding learned only through the embedding layer limits the performance of existing CTR models. Some works apply extra modules on top of the embedding layer to dynamically refine feature representations in different instances, making it effective and easy to integrate with existing CTR methods. Despite the promising results, there is a lack of a systematic review and summarization of this new promising direction on the CTR task. To fill this gap, we comprehensively summarize and define a new module, namely \\textbf{feature refinement} (FR) module, that can be applied between feature embedding and interaction layers. We extract 14 FR modules from previous works, including instances where the FR module was proposed but not clearly defined or explained. We fully assess the effectiveness and compatibility of existing FR modules through comprehensive and extensive experiments with over 200 augmented models and over 4,000 runs for more than 15,000 GPU hours. The results offer insightful guidelines for researchers, and all benchmarking code and experimental results are open-sourced. In addition, we present a new architecture of assigning independent FR modules to separate sub-networks for parallel CTR models, as opposed to the conventional method of inserting a shared FR module on top of the embedding layer. Our approach is also supported by comprehensive experiments demonstrating its effectiveness. ",

    "title": "VET: Visual Error Tomography for Point Cloud Completion and High-Quality  Neural Rendering",
    "abstract": "In the last few years, deep neural networks opened the doors for big advances in novel view synthesis. Many of these approaches are based on a (coarse) proxy geometry obtained by structure from motion algorithms. Small deficiencies in this proxy can be fixed by neural rendering, but larger holes or missing parts, as they commonly appear for thin structures or for glossy regions, still lead to distracting artifacts and temporal instability. In this paper, we present a novel neural-rendering-based approach to detect and fix such deficiencies. As a proxy, we use a point cloud, which allows us to easily remove outlier geometry and to fill in missing geometry without complicated topological operations. Keys to our approach are (i) a differentiable, blending point-based renderer that can blend out redundant points, as well as (ii) the concept of Visual Error Tomography (VET), which allows us to lift 2D error maps to identify 3D-regions lacking geometry and to spawn novel points accordingly. Furthermore, (iii) by adding points as nested environment maps, our approach allows us to generate high-quality renderings of the surroundings in the same pipeline. In our results, we show that our approach can improve the quality of a point cloud obtained by structure from motion and thus increase novel view synthesis quality significantly. In contrast to point growing techniques, the approach can also fix large-scale holes and missing thin structures effectively. Rendering quality outperforms state-of-the-art methods and temporal stability is significantly improved, while rendering is possible at real-time frame rates. ",

    "title": "Towards Deeper, Lighter and Interpretable Cross Network for CTR  Prediction",
    "abstract": "Click Through Rate (CTR) prediction plays an essential role in recommender systems and online advertising. It is crucial to effectively model feature interactions to improve the prediction performance of CTR models. However, existing methods face three significant challenges. First, while most methods can automatically capture high-order feature interactions, their performance tends to diminish as the order of feature interactions increases. Second, existing methods lack the ability to provide convincing interpretations of the prediction results, especially for high-order feature interactions, which limits the trustworthiness of their predictions. Third, many methods suffer from the presence of redundant parameters, particularly in the embedding layer. This paper proposes a novel method called Gated Deep Cross Network (GDCN) and a Field-level Dimension Optimization (FDO) approach to address these challenges. As the core structure of GDCN, Gated Cross Network (GCN) captures explicit high-order feature interactions and dynamically filters important interactions with an information gate in each order. Additionally, we use the FDO approach to learn condensed dimensions for each field based on their importance. Comprehensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, superiority and interpretability of GDCN. Moreover, we verify the effectiveness of FDO in learning various dimensions and reducing model parameters. The code is available on \\url{https://github.com/anonctr/GDCN}. ",

    "abstract": "The blockchain brought interesting properties for many practical applications. However, some properties, such as the transaction processing throughput remained limited, especially in Proof-of-Work blockchains. Therefore, several promising directions, such as sharding designs and DAG-based protocols emerged. In this paper, we focus on DAG-based consensus protocols and present a discrete-event simulator for them. Our simulator can simulate realistic blockchain networks created from data of a Bitcoin network, while its network configuration and topology can be customized. The simulated network consists of honest and malicious miners. Malicious miners do not make any attack on consensus itself. Instead, they use a different transaction selection strategy than honest miners (who select transactions randomly) with the intention to earn unfairly more profits than honest miners at the cost of downgrading the protocol performance by duplicate transactions. As a consequence, this harms the performance of some DAG-based protocols (e.g., PHANTOM and GHOSTDAG) in terms of transaction processing throughput, which we demonstrate in our experiments and extend the results of the related work that contains a small-scale network of 10 nodes by the results obtained on a large-scale network with 7000 nodes. Next, we empirically compare different algorithms for the mempool structure, and we propose a composite mempool structure that is memory-efficient and thus convenient for simulations of resource-demanding large-scale networks.

Unfortunately, there is no free lunch but a high price to be paid in terms of computing overhead introduced by noisy neighbors problem when multiple virtualized base station instances share computing platforms. In this paper, first, we thoroughly dissect the multiple sources of computing overhead in a vRAN, quantifying their different contributions to the overall performance degradation. Second, we design an AI-driven Radio Intelligent Controller (AIRIC) to orchestrate vRAN computing resources. AIRIC relies upon a hybrid neural network architecture combining a relation network (RN) and a deep Q-Network (DQN) such that: (i) the demand of concurrent virtual base stations is satisfied considering the overhead posed by the noisy neighbors problem while the operating costs of the vRAN infrastructure is minimized; and (ii) dynamically changing contexts in terms of network demand, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the number of base station instances are efficiently supported. Our results show that AIRIC performs very closely to an offline optimal oracle, attaining up to 30% resource savings, and substantially outperforms existing benchmarks in service guarantees. ",

    "abstract": "The paradigm of Transformers using the self-attention mechanism has manifested its advantage in learning graph-structured data. Yet, Graph Transformers are capable of modeling full range dependencies but are often deficient in extracting information from locality. A common practice is to utilize Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) as an auxiliary to capture local information, which however are still inadequate for comprehending substructures. In this paper, we present a purely attention-based architecture, namely Focal and Full-Range Graph Transformer (FFGT), which can mitigate the loss of local information in learning global correlations. The core component of FFGT is a new mechanism of compound attention, which combines the conventional full-range attention with K-hop focal attention on ego-nets to aggregate both global and local information. Beyond the scope of canonical Transformers, the FFGT has the merit of being more substructure-aware. Our approach enhances the performance of existing Graph Transformers on various open datasets, while achieves compatible SOTA performance on several Long-Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB) datasets even with a vanilla transformer. We further examine influential factors on the optimal focal length of attention via introducing a novel synthetic dataset based on SBM-PATTERN. ",

    "abstract": "Modern machine learning (ML) models have grown to a scale where training them on a single machine becomes impractical. As a result, there is a growing trend to leverage federated learning (FL) techniques to train large ML models in a distributed and collaborative manner. These models, however, when deployed on new devices, might struggle to generalize well due to domain shifts. In this context, federated domain adaptation (FDA) emerges as a powerful approach to address this challenge. Most existing FDA approaches typically focus on aligning the distributions between source and target domains by minimizing their (e.g., MMD) distance. Such strategies, however, inevitably introduce high communication overheads and can be highly sensitive to network reliability. In this paper, we introduce RF-TCA, an enhancement to the standard Transfer Component Analysis approach that significantly accelerates computation without compromising theoretical and empirical performance. Leveraging the computational advantage of RF-TCA, we further extend it to FDA setting with FedRF-TCA. The proposed FedRF-TCA protocol boasts communication complexity that is \\emph{independent} of the sample size, while maintaining performance that is either comparable to or even surpasses state-of-the-art FDA methods. We present extensive experiments to showcase the superior performance and robustness (to network condition) of FedRF-TCA. ",

Robots offer a good solution for sustainable and cost-effective 13 production. Acquiring accurate spatial information about relevant plant parts is vital for 14 successful robot operation. Robot perception in greenhouses is challenging due to variations in 15 plant appearance, viewpoints, and illumination. This paper proposes a keypoint-detection-based 16 method using data from an RGB-D camera to estimate the 3D pose of peduncle nodes, which 17 provides essential information to harvest the tomato bunches. 18 19 Specifically, this paper proposes a method that detects four anatomical landmarks in the color 20 image and then integrates 3D point-cloud information to determine the 3D pose. A 21 comprehensive evaluation was conducted in a commercial greenhouse to gain insight into the 22 performance of different parts of the method. The results showed: (1) high accuracy in object 23 detection, achieving an Average Precision (AP) of AP@0.5=0.96; (2) an average Percentage of 24 Detected Joints (PDJ) of the keypoints of PhDJ@0.2=94.31%; and (3) 3D pose estimation 25 accuracy with mean absolute errors (MAE) of 11.38o and 9.93o for the relative upper and lower 26 angles between the peduncle and main stem, respectively. Furthermore, the capability to handle 27 variations in viewpoint was investigated, demonstrating the method was robust to view changes. 28 However, canonical and higher views resulted in slightly higher performance compared to other 29 views.

We observe peculiar breakdowns in performance when the number of processes is prime. Investigating this effect, we create first-principles data traffic models for each of the stencil-like hotspot loops. With application measurements and microbenchmarks to study memory data traffic behavior, we can connect the breakdowns to SpecI2M, a new write-allocate evasion feature in current Intel CPUs. We identify conditions under which SpecI2M works as intended and where it fails to avoid write-allocate transfers. Write-allocate evasion works best if large arrays are written consecutively; in the CloverLeaf code, non-temporal stores can be employed on top for best results. For serial and full-node cases we are able to predict the memory data volume analytically with an error of a few percent. We find that if the number of processes is prime, SpecI2M fails to work properly, which we can attribute to short inner loops emerging from the one-dimensional domain decomposition in this case. We can also rule out other possible causes of the prime number effect, such as breaking layer conditions, MPI communication overhead, and load imbalance. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning based object detectors struggle generalizing to a new target domain bearing significant variations in object and background. Most current methods align domains by using image or instance-level adversarial feature alignment. This often suffers due to unwanted background and lacks class-specific alignment. A straightforward approach to promote class-level alignment is to use high confidence predictions on unlabeled domain as pseudo-labels. These predictions are often noisy since model is poorly calibrated under domain shift. In this paper, we propose to leverage model's predictive uncertainty to strike the right balance between adversarial feature alignment and class-level alignment. We develop a technique to quantify predictive uncertainty on class assignments and bounding-box predictions. Model predictions with low uncertainty are used to generate pseudo-labels for self-training, whereas the ones with higher uncertainty are used to generate tiles for adversarial feature alignment. This synergy between tiling around uncertain object regions and generating pseudo-labels from highly certain object regions allows capturing both image and instance-level context during the model adaptation. We report thorough ablation study to reveal the impact of different components in our approach. Results on five diverse and challenging adaptation scenarios show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods with noticeable margins. ",

Hence, we explore developing a neural network from scratch directly trained on SOD without ImageNet pre-training. Such a formulation offers full autonomy to design task-specific components. To that end, we propose SODAWideNet, an encoder-decoder-style network for Salient Object Detection. We deviate from the commonly practiced paradigm of narrow and deep convolutional models to a wide and shallow architecture, resulting in a parameter-efficient deep neural network. To achieve a shallower network, we increase the receptive field from the beginning of the network using a combination of dilated convolutions and self-attention. Therefore, we propose Multi Receptive Field Feature Aggregation Module (MRFFAM) that efficiently obtains discriminative features from farther regions at higher resolutions using dilated convolutions. Next, we propose Multi-Scale Attention (MSA), which creates a feature pyramid and efficiently computes attention across multiple resolutions to extract global features from larger feature maps. Finally, we propose two variants, SODAWideNet-S (3.03M) and SODAWideNet (9.03M), that achieve competitive performance against state-of-the-art models on five datasets. ",

    "abstract": "We present a novel self-supervised approach for representation learning, particularly for the task of Visual Relationship Detection (VRD). Motivated by the effectiveness of Masked Image Modeling (MIM), we propose Masked Bounding Box Reconstruction (MBBR), a variation of MIM where a percentage of the entities/objects within a scene are masked and subsequently reconstructed based on the unmasked objects. The core idea is that, through object-level masked modeling, the network learns context-aware representations that capture the interaction of objects within a scene and thus are highly predictive of visual object relationships. We extensively evaluate learned representations, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in a few-shot setting and demonstrate the efficacy of MBBR for learning robust visual representations, particularly tailored for VRD. The proposed method is able to surpass state-of-the-art VRD methods on the Predicate Detection (PredDet) evaluation setting, using only a few annotated samples.

    "abstract": "Although graph neural networks have achieved great success in the task of molecular property prediction in recent years, their generalization ability under out-of-distribution (OOD) settings is still under-explored. Different from existing methods that learn discriminative representations for prediction, we propose a generative model with semantic-components identifiability, named SCI. We demonstrate that the latent variables in this generative model can be explicitly identified into semantic-relevant (SR) and semantic-irrelevant (SI) components, which contributes to better OOD generalization by involving minimal change properties of causal mechanisms. Specifically, we first formulate the data generation process from the atom level to the molecular level, where the latent space is split into SI substructures, SR substructures, and SR atom variables. Sequentially, to reduce misidentification, we restrict the minimal changes of the SR atom variables and add a semantic latent substructure regularization to mitigate the variance of the SR substructure under augmented domain changes. Under mild assumptions, we prove the block-wise identifiability of the SR substructure and the comment-wise identifiability of SR atom variables. Experimental studies achieve state-of-the-art performance and show general improvement on 21 datasets in 3 mainstream benchmarks. Moreover, the visualization results of the proposed SCI method provide insightful case studies and explanations for the prediction results.

    "abstract": "The evolution towards a more distributed and interconnected grid necessitates large-scale decision-making within strict temporal constraints. Machine learning (ML) paradigms have demonstrated significant potential in improving the efficacy of optimization processes. However, the feasibility of solutions derived from ML models continues to pose challenges. It's imperative that ML models produce solutions that are attainable and realistic within the given system constraints of power systems. To address the feasibility issue and expedite the solution search process, we proposed LOOP-LC 2.0(Learning to Optimize the Optimization Process with Linear Constraints version 2.0) as a learning-based approach for solving the power dispatch problem. A notable advantage of the LOOP-LC 2.0 framework is its ability to ensure near-optimality and strict feasibility of solutions without depending on computationally intensive post-processing procedures, thus eliminating the need for iterative processes. At the heart of the LOOP-LC 2.0 model lies the newly proposed generalized gauge map method, capable of mapping any infeasible solution to a feasible point within the linearly-constrained domain. The proposed generalized gauge map method improves the traditional gauge map by exhibiting reduced sensitivity to input variances while increasing search speeds significantly. Utilizing the IEEE-200 test case as a benchmark, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the LOOP-LC 2.0 methodology, confirming its superior performance in terms of training speed, computational time, optimality, and solution feasibility compared to existing methodologies.

    "abstract": "Motivation: In predicting HIV therapy outcomes, a critical clinical question is whether using historical information can enhance predictive capabilities compared with current or latest available data analysis. This study analyses whether historical knowledge, which includes viral mutations detected in all genotypic tests before therapy, their temporal occurrence, and concomitant viral load measurements, can bring improvements. We introduce a method to weigh mutations, considering the previously enumerated factors and the reference mutation-drug Stanford resistance tables. We compare a model encompassing history (H) with one not using it (NH). Results: The H-model demonstrates superior discriminative ability, with a higher ROC-AUC score (76.34%) than the NH-model (74.98%). Significant Wilcoxon test results confirm that incorporating historical information improves consistently predictive accuracy for treatment outcomes. The better performance of the H-model might be attributed to its consideration of latent HIV reservoirs, probably obtained when leveraging historical information. The findings emphasize the importance of temporal dynamics in mutations, offering insights into HIV infection complexities. However, our result also shows that prediction accuracy remains relatively high even when no historical information is available. Supplementary information: Supplementary material is available. ",

The resulting framework, when combined with an efficient method for factorizing high-dimensional vectors, can represent and operate on numerical values over a large dynamic range using vastly fewer resources than previous methods, and it exhibits impressive robustness to noise. We demonstrate the potential for this framework to solve computationally difficult problems in visual perception and combinatorial optimization, showing improvement over baseline methods.

    "abstract": "In modern neuroscience, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been a crucial and irreplaceable tool that provides a non-invasive window into the dynamics of whole-brain activity. Nevertheless, fMRI is limited by hemodynamic blurring as well as high cost, immobility, and incompatibility with metal implants. Electroencephalography (EEG) is complementary to fMRI and can directly record the cortical electrical activity at high temporal resolution, but has more limited spatial resolution and is unable to recover information about deep subcortical brain structures. The ability to obtain fMRI information from EEG would enable cost-effective, imaging across a wider set of brain regions. Further, beyond augmenting the capabilities of EEG, cross-modality models would facilitate the interpretation of fMRI signals. However, as both EEG and fMRI are high-dimensional and prone to artifacts, it is currently challenging to model fMRI from EEG. To address this challenge, we propose a novel architecture that can predict fMRI signals directly from multi-channel EEG without explicit feature engineering. Our model achieves this by implementing a Sinusoidal Representation Network (SIREN) to learn frequency information in brain dynamics from EEG, which serves as the input to a subsequent encoder-decoder to effectively reconstruct the fMRI signal from a specific brain region. We evaluate our model using a simultaneous EEG-fMRI dataset with 8 subjects and investigate its potential for predicting subcortical fMRI signals. The present results reveal that our model outperforms a recent state-of-the-art model, and indicates the potential of leveraging periodic activation functions in deep neural networks to model functional neuroimaging data.

These peptides present promising modifications to biological, pharmacological, and physiochemical attributes in both endogenous and engineered peptides.

We herein propose PepLand, a novel pre-training architecture for representation and property analysis of peptides spanning both canonical and non-canonical amino acids.

Empirical validations underscore PepLand's effectiveness across an array of peptide property predictions, encompassing protein-protein interactions, permeability, solubility, and synthesizability. The rigorous evaluation confirms PepLand's unparalleled capability in capturing salient synthetic peptide features, thereby laying a robust foundation for transformative advances in peptide-centric research domains.

In contrast to the recognition problem for graphs that admit a quasi-transitive orientation, we find it is NP-complete to decide if a graph admits a partial orientation as a quasi-transitive mixed graph. We prove the problem is Polynomial when restricted to inputs of maximum degree three, but remains NP-complete when restricted to inputs with maximum degree at least five. Our proof further implies that for fixed $k \\geq 3$, it is NP-complete to decide if a graph arises as an undirected square of an orientation of a graph with $\\Delta = k$. ",

Within the realm of optical neuromorphic engineering, various optical neural networks (ONNs) have been explored. Among these, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have exhibited notable success in emulating the computational principles of the human brain. Nevertheless, the integration of optical SNN processors has presented formidable obstacles, mainly when dealing with the computational demands of large datasets.

We have meticulously designed various optical components within the OSCNN to tackle object detection tasks across prominent benchmark datasets, including MNIST, ETH 80, and Caltech. Our results demonstrate promising performance with minimal latency and power consumption compared to their electronic ONN counterparts. Additionally, we conducted several pertinent simulations, such as optical intensity to-latency conversion and synchronization.

While various scenarios, such as shared-memory, local-memory, and consensus-based approaches, have been extensively studied in isolation, there remains a need for further exploration of their interconnections. This paper specifically concentrates on a scenario where agents collaborate toward a unified mission while potentially having distinct tasks. Each agent's actions can potentially impact other agents through interactions. Within this context, the objective for the agents is to optimize their local parameters based on the aggregate of local reward functions, where only local zeroth-order oracles are available. Notably, the learning process is asynchronous, meaning that agents update and query their zeroth-order oracles asynchronously while communicating with other agents subject to bounded but possibly random communication delays. This paper presents theoretical convergence analyses and establishes a convergence rate for the proposed approach. Furthermore, it addresses the relevant issue of deep learning-based resource allocation in communication networks and conducts numerical experiments in which agents, acting as transmitters, collaboratively train their individual (possibly unique) policies to maximize a common performance metric.

High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common and aggressive histological type. Guided treatment for HGSOC typically involves platinum-based combination chemotherapy, necessitating an assessment of whether the patient is platinum-resistant. The purpose of this study is to propose a deep learning-based method to determine whether a patient is platinum-resistant using multimodal positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) images. Methods: 289 patients with HGSOC were included in this study. An end-to-end SE-SPP-DenseNet model was built by adding Squeeze-Excitation Block (SE Block) and Spatial Pyramid Pooling Layer (SPPLayer) to Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet). Multimodal data from PET/CT images of the regions of interest (ROI) were used to predict platinum resistance in patients. Results: Through five-fold cross-validation, SE-SPP-DenseNet achieved a high accuracy rate and an area under the curve (AUC) in predicting platinum resistance in patients, which were 92.6% and 0.93, respectively. The importance of incorporating SE Block and SPPLayer into the deep learning model, and considering multimodal data was substantiated by carrying out ablation studies and experiments with single modality data. Conclusions: The obtained classification results indicate that our proposed deep learning framework performs better in predicting platinum resistance in patients, which can help gynecologists make better treatment decisions.
