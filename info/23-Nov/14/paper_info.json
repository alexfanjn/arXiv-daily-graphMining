    "abstract": "In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (Co-MARL), a team of agents must jointly optimize the team's long-term rewards to learn a designated task. Optimizing rewards as a team often requires inter-agent communication and data sharing, leading to potential privacy implications. We assume privacy considerations prohibit the agents from sharing their environment interaction data. Accordingly, we propose Privacy-Engineered Value Decomposition Networks (PE-VDN), a Co-MARL algorithm that models multi-agent coordination while provably safeguarding the confidentiality of the agents' environment interaction data. We integrate three privacy-engineering techniques to redesign the data flows of the VDN algorithm, an existing Co-MARL algorithm that consolidates the agents' environment interaction data to train a central controller that models multi-agent coordination, and develop PE-VDN. In the first technique, we design a distributed computation scheme that eliminates Vanilla VDN's dependency on sharing environment interaction data. Then, we utilize a privacy-preserving multi-party computation protocol to guarantee that the data flows of the distributed computation scheme do not pose new privacy risks. Finally, we enforce differential privacy to preempt inference threats against the agents' training data, past environment interactions, when they take actions based on their neural network predictions. We implement PE-VDN in StarCraft Multi-Agent Competition (SMAC) and show that it achieves 80% of Vanilla VDN's win rate while maintaining differential privacy levels that provide meaningful privacy guarantees. The results demonstrate that PE-VDN can safeguard the confidentiality of agents' environment interaction data without sacrificing multi-agent coordination. ",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the causal relationship between campus walkability and the emotional walking experiences of students, with a focus on their mental well-being. Using data from 697 participants across seven Chinese tertiary education campuses, the study employs a counterfactual analysis to estimate the impact of campus walkability on students' walking experiences. The analysis reveals that students living in campuses with improved walkability are 9.75% more likely to have positive walking experiences compared to those without walkability renovations. While walking attitude is strongly correlated with walking experiences, the study emphasizes the significance of objective factors such as campus surroundings and the availability of walking spaces in influencing the walking experience. Geographical features, including campus walkability improvements, have the most substantial impact, and this effect varies across different subsets of respondents. These findings underscore the importance of considering specific subsets and geographical features when assessing the impact of walkability improvements on the walking experience. In conclusion, the study provides compelling evidence of a causal link between improved campus walkability and enhanced emotional walking experiences among students, suggesting the need for further research on mediating factors and cultural variations affecting student mental health on various Chinese campuses.

    "abstract": "Algorithmic robustness refers to the sustained performance of a computational system in the face of change in the nature of the environment in which that system operates or in the task that the system is meant to perform. Below, we motivate the importance of algorithmic robustness, present a conceptual framework, and highlight the relevant areas of research for which algorithmic robustness is relevant. Why robustness? Robustness is an important enabler of other goals that are frequently cited in the context of public policy decisions about computational systems, including trustworthiness, accountability, fairness, and safety. Despite this dependence, it tends to be under-recognized compared to these other concepts. This is unfortunate, because robustness is often more immediately achievable than these other ultimate goals, which can be more subjective and exacting. Thus, we highlight robustness as an important goal for researchers, engineers, regulators, and policymakers when considering the design, implementation, and deployment of computational systems. We urge researchers and practitioners to elevate the attention paid to robustness when designing and evaluating computational systems. For many key systems, the immediate question after any demonstration of high performance should be: \"How robust is that performance to realistic changes in the task or environment?\" Greater robustness will set the stage for systems that are more trustworthy, accountable, fair, and safe. Toward that end, this document provides a brief roadmap to some of the concepts and existing research around the idea of algorithmic robustness. ",

To combat these challenges, we introduce CALLOC, a novel framework designed to resist adversarial attacks and variations across indoor environments and devices that reduce system accuracy and reliability. CALLOC employs a novel adaptive curriculum learning approach with a domain specific lightweight scaled-dot product attention neural network, tailored for adversarial and variation resilience in practical use cases with resource constrained mobile devices.

As the predictive specificity of a classifier depends on the specificity of the labels it is trained on, it follows that finely-labelled datasets are crucial for advances in machine learning. Aiming to stimulate progress in the field of machine listening, this paper introduces AeroSonicDB (YPAD-0523), a dataset of low-flying aircraft sounds for training acoustic detection and classification systems. This paper describes the method of exploiting ADS-B radio transmissions to passively collect and label audio samples. Provides a summary of the collated dataset.

These 625 samples feature 301 unique aircraft, each of which are supplied with 14 supplementary (non-acoustic) labels to describe the aircraft. The dataset also contains 3.52 hours of ambient background audio (\"silence\"), as a means to distinguish aircraft noise from other local environmental noises. Additionally, 6 hours of urban soundscape recordings (with aircraft annotations) are included as an ancillary method for evaluating model performance, and to provide a testing ground for real-time applications.

    "abstract": "Data from interconnected vehicles may contain sensitive information such as location, driving behavior, personal identifiers, etc. Without adequate safeguards, sharing this data jeopardizes data privacy and system security. The current centralized data-sharing paradigm in these systems raises particular concerns about data privacy. Recognizing these challenges, the shift towards decentralized interactions in technology, as echoed by the principles of Industry 5.0, becomes paramount. This work is closely aligned with these principles, emphasizing decentralized, human-centric, and secure technological interactions in an interconnected vehicular ecosystem. To embody this, we propose a practical approach that merges two emerging technologies: Federated Learning (FL) and Blockchain. The integration of these technologies enables the creation of a decentralized vehicular network. In this setting, vehicles can learn from each other without compromising privacy while also ensuring data integrity and accountability. Initial experiments show that compared to conventional decentralized federated learning techniques, our proposed approach significantly enhances the performance and security of vehicular networks. The system's accuracy stands at 91.92\\%. While this may appear to be low in comparison to state-of-the-art federated learning models, our work is noteworthy because, unlike others, it was achieved in a malicious vehicle setting. Despite the challenging environment, our method maintains high accuracy, making it a competent solution for preserving data privacy in vehicular networks. ",

    "abstract": "In this work we use the persistent homology method, a technique in topological data analysis (TDA), to extract essential topological features from the data space and combine them with deep learning features for classification tasks. In TDA, the concepts of complexes and filtration are building blocks. Firstly, a filtration is constructed from some complex. Then, persistent homology classes are computed, and their evolution along the filtration is visualized through the persistence diagram. Additionally, we applied vectorization techniques to the persistence diagram to make this topological information compatible with machine learning algorithms. This was carried out with the aim of classifying images from multiple classes in the MNIST dataset. Our approach inserts topological features into deep learning approaches composed by single and two-streams neural networks architectures based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and a convolutional neral network (CNN) taylored for multi-class classification in the MNIST dataset. In our analysis, we evaluated the obtained results and compared them with the outcomes achieved through the baselines that are available in the TensorFlow library. The main conclusion is that topological information may increase neural network accuracy in multi-class classification tasks with the price of computational complexity of persistent homology calculation. Up to the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that combines deep learning features and the combination of topological features for multi-class classification tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Nature has always been our inspiration in the research, design and development of materials and has driven us to gain a deep understanding of the mechanisms that characterize anisotropy and inelastic behavior. All this knowledge has been accumulated in the principles of thermodynamics. Deduced from these principles, the multiplicative decomposition combined with pseudo potentials are powerful and universal concepts. Simultaneously, the tremendous increase in computational performance enabled us to investigate and rethink our history-dependent material models to make the most of our predictions. Today, we have reached a point where materials and their models are becoming increasingly sophisticated. This raises the question: How do we find the best model that includes all inelastic effects to explain our complex data? Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks (CANN) may answer this question. Here, we extend the CANNs to inelastic materials (iCANN). Rigorous considerations of objectivity, rigid motion of the reference configuration, multiplicative decomposition and its inherent non-uniqueness, restrictions of energy and pseudo potential, and consistent evolution guide us towards the architecture of the iCANN satisfying thermodynamics per design. We combine feed-forward networks of the free energy and pseudo potential with a recurrent neural network approach to take time dependencies into account. We demonstrate that the iCANN is capable of autonomously discovering models for artificially generated data, the response of polymers for cyclic loading and the relaxation behavior of muscle data. As the design of the network is not limited to visco-elasticity, our vision is that the iCANN will reveal to us new ways to find the various inelastic phenomena hidden in the data and to understand their interaction.

While they can benefit from advancements in NLP, particularly large language models, their real-world adoption faces challenges due to absence of comprehensive benchmarks for various HR tasks, and lack of smaller models with competitive capabilities. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing the Resume-Job Description Benchmark (RJDB). We meticulously craft this benchmark to cater to a wide array of HR tasks, including matching and explaining resumes to job descriptions, extracting skills and experiences from resumes, and editing resumes. To create this benchmark, we propose to distill domain-specific knowledge from a large language model (LLM). We rely on a curated skill-occupation graph to ensure diversity and provide context for LLMs generation. Our benchmark includes over 50 thousand triples of job descriptions, matched resumes and unmatched resumes. Using RJDB, we train multiple smaller student models. Our experiments reveal that the student models achieve near/better performance than the teacher model (GPT-4), affirming the effectiveness of the benchmark. Additionally, we explore the utility of RJDB on out-of-distribution data for skill extraction and resume-job description matching, in zero-shot and weak supervision manner.

    "abstract": "Recognition and reasoning are two pillars of visual understanding. However, these tasks have an imbalance in focus; whereas recent advances in neural networks have shown strong empirical performance in visual recognition, there has been comparably much less success in solving visual reasoning. Intuitively, unifying these two tasks under a singular framework is desirable, as they are mutually dependent and beneficial. Motivated by the recent success of multi-task transformers for visual recognition and language understanding, we propose a unified neural architecture for visual recognition and reasoning with a generic interface (e.g., tokens) for both. Our framework enables the principled investigation of how different visual recognition tasks, datasets, and inductive biases can help enable spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities. Noticeably, we find that object detection, which requires spatial localization of individual objects, is the most beneficial recognition task for reasoning. We further demonstrate via probing that implicit object-centric representations emerge automatically inside our framework. Intriguingly, we discover that certain architectural choices such as the backbone model of the visual encoder have a significant impact on visual reasoning, but little on object detection. Given the results of our experiments, we believe that visual reasoning should be considered as a first-class citizen alongside visual recognition, as they are strongly correlated but benefit from potentially different design choices.

For social robots to be able to behave appropriately, they need to be aware of the social context they act in. Consider, for example, a robot with the task to deliver a personal message to a person. If the person is arguing with an office mate at the time of message delivery, it might be more appropriate to delay playing the message as to respect the recipient's privacy and not to interfere with the current situation. This can only be done if the situation is classified correctly and in a second step if an appropriate behavior is chosen that fits the social situation. Our work aims to enable robots accomplishing the task of classifying social situations by creating a dataset composed of semantically annotated video scenes of office situations from television soap operas. The dataset can then serve as a basis for conducting research in both computer vision and human-robot interaction. ",

To alleviate this issue, by observing that the diversity of inputs can boost transferability, input regularization based methods are proposed, which craft adversarial examples by combining several transformed inputs. We reveal that input regularization based methods make resultant adversarial examples biased towards flat extreme regions. Inspired by this, we propose an attack called flatness-aware adversarial attack (FAA) which explicitly adds a flatness-aware regularization term in the optimization target to promote the resultant adversarial examples towards flat extreme regions. The flatness-aware regularization term involves gradients of samples around the resultant adversarial examples but optimizing gradients requires the evaluation of Hessian matrix in high-dimension spaces which generally is intractable. To address the problem, we derive an approximate solution to circumvent the construction of Hessian matrix, thereby making FAA practical and cheap. Extensive experiments show the transferability of adversarial examples crafted by FAA can be considerably boosted compared with state-of-the-art baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Control of a dynamical system without the knowledge of dynamics is an important and challenging task. Modern machine learning approaches, such as deep neural networks (DNNs), allow for the estimation of a dynamics model from control inputs and corresponding state observation outputs. Such data-driven models are often utilized for the derivation of model-based controllers. However, in general, there are no guarantees that a model represented by DNNs will be controllable according to the formal control-theoretical meaning of controllability, which is crucial for the design of effective controllers. This often precludes the use of DNN-estimated models in applications, where formal controllability guarantees are required. In this proof-of-the-concept work, we propose a control-theoretical method that explicitly enhances models estimated from data with controllability. That is achieved by augmenting the model estimation objective with a controllability constraint, which penalizes models with a low degree of controllability. As a result, the models estimated with the proposed controllability constraint allow for the derivation of more efficient controllers, they are interpretable by the control-theoretical quantities and have a lower long-term prediction error. The proposed method provides new insights on the connection between the DNN-based estimation of unknown dynamics and the control-theoretical guarantees of the solution properties. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in two standard classical control systems with state observation given by low resolution high-dimensional images. ",

    "abstract": "Deep generative models have emerged as a promising approach in the medical image domain to address data scarcity. However, their use for sequential data like respiratory sounds is less explored. In this work, we propose a straightforward approach to augment imbalanced respiratory sound data using an audio diffusion model as a conditional neural vocoder. We also demonstrate a simple yet effective adversarial fine-tuning method to align features between the synthetic and real respiratory sound samples to improve respiratory sound classification performance. Our experimental results on the ICBHI dataset demonstrate that the proposed adversarial fine-tuning is effective, while only using the conventional augmentation method shows performance degradation. Moreover, our method outperforms the baseline by 2.24% on the ICBHI Score and improves the accuracy of the minority classes up to 26.58%.

    "abstract": "To facilitate reliable deployments of autonomous robots in the real world, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection capabilities are often required. A powerful approach for OOD detection is based on density estimation with Normalizing Flows (NFs). However, we find that prior work with NFs attempts to match the complex target distribution topologically with naive base distributions leading to adverse implications. In this work, we circumvent this topological mismatch using an expressive class-conditional base distribution trained with an information-theoretic objective to match the required topology. The proposed method enjoys the merits of wide compatibility with existing learned models without any performance degradation and minimum computation overhead while enhancing OOD detection capabilities. We demonstrate superior results in density estimation and 2D object detection benchmarks in comparison with extensive baselines. Moreover, we showcase the applicability of the method with a real-robot deployment. ",

However, these networks can be difficult or impossible to train accurately for some systems of equations. We present a novel multifidelity framework for stacking physics-informed neural networks and operator networks that facilitates training. We successively build a chain of networks, where the output at one step can act as a low-fidelity input for training the next step, gradually increasing the expressivity of the learned model. The equations imposed at each step of the iterative process can be the same or different (akin to simulated annealing). The iterative (stacking) nature of the proposed method allows us to progressively learn features of a solution that are hard to learn directly. Through benchmark problems including a nonlinear pendulum, the wave equation, and the viscous Burgers equation, we show how stacking can be used to improve the accuracy and reduce the required size of physics-informed neural networks and operator networks.

Most existing works focus on undirected graphs which overlooks the rich information carried by the edge directions. Recently, the problem of community search over directed graphs (or CSD problem) has been studied; it finds a connected subgraph containing q, where the in-degree and out-degree of each vertex within the subgraph are at least k and l, respectively. However, existing solutions are inefficient, especially on large graphs. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel index called D-Forest, which allows a CSD query to be completed within the optimal time cost. We further propose efficient index construction methods. Extensive experiments on six real large graphs show that our index-based query algorithm is up to two orders of magnitude faster than existing solutions. ",

    "abstract": "Traffic accidents frequently lead to fatal injuries, contributing to over 50 million deaths until 2023. To mitigate driving hazards and ensure personal safety, it is crucial to assist vehicles in anticipating important objects during travel. Previous research on important object detection primarily assessed the importance of individual participants, treating them as independent entities and frequently overlooking the connections between these participants. Unfortunately, this approach has proven less effective in detecting important objects in complex scenarios. In response, we introduce Driving scene Relationship self-Understanding transformer (DRUformer), designed to enhance the important object detection task. The DRUformer is a transformer-based multi-modal important object detection model that takes into account the relationships between all the participants in the driving scenario. Recognizing that driving intention also significantly affects the detection of important objects during driving, we have incorporated a module for embedding driving intention. To assess the performance of our approach, we conducted a comparative experiment on the DRAMA dataset, pitting our model against other state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. The results demonstrated a noteworthy 16.2\\% improvement in mIoU and a substantial 12.3\\% boost in ACC compared to SOTA methods. Furthermore, we conducted a qualitative analysis of our model's ability to detect important objects across different road scenarios and classes, highlighting its effectiveness in diverse contexts. Finally, we conducted various ablation studies to assess the efficiency of the proposed modules in our DRUformer model. ",

    "abstract": "Decentralized learning is widely employed for collaboratively training models using distributed data over wireless networks. Existing decentralized learning methods primarily focus on training single-modal networks. For the decentralized multi-modal learning (DMML), the modality heterogeneity and the non-independent and non-identically distributed (non-IID) data across devices make it difficult for the training model to capture the correlated features across different modalities. Moreover, modality competition can result in training imbalance among different modalities, which can significantly impact the performance of DMML. To improve the training performance in the presence of non-IID data and modality heterogeneity, we propose a novel DMML with knowledge distillation (DMML-KD) framework, which decomposes the extracted feature into the modality-common and the modality-specific components. In the proposed DMML-KD, a generator is applied to learn the global conditional distribution of the modality-common features, thereby guiding the modality-common features of different devices towards the same distribution. Meanwhile, we propose to decrease the number of local iterations for the modalities with fast training speed in DMML-KD to address the imbalanced training. We design a balance metric based on the parameter variation to evaluate the training speed of different modalities in DMML-KD. Using this metric, we optimize the number of local iterations for different modalities on each device under the constraint of remaining energy on devices. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DMML-KD with training balance can effectively improve the training performance of DMML. ",

Subsequently, we introduce an affinity-augmentation method to accentuate differences between normal and abnormal latent representations. Leveraging the classic support vector data description algorithm yields final detection results. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that our proposed method achieves outstanding detection and segmentation performance on the widely used MVTec AD dataset, with rates of 95.8% and 96.8%, respectively, establishing a state-of-the-art benchmark for both texture and object defects.

As these models evolve with increasing parameters, they excel in tasks like sentiment analysis and machine translation. However, even models with billions of parameters face challenges in tasks demanding multi-step reasoning. Code generation and comprehension, especially in C and C++, emerge as significant challenges. While LLMs trained on code datasets demonstrate competence in many tasks, they struggle with rectifying non-compilable C and C++ code. Our investigation attributes this subpar performance to two primary factors: the quality of the training dataset and the inherent complexity of the problem which demands intricate reasoning. Existing \"Chain of Thought\" (CoT) prompting techniques aim to enhance multi-step reasoning. This approach, however, retains the limitations associated with the latent drawbacks of LLMs. In this work, we propose CompCodeVet, a compiler-guided CoT approach to produce compilable code from non-compilable ones. Diverging from the conventional approach of utilizing larger LLMs, we employ compilers as a teacher to establish a more robust zero-shot thought process. The evaluation of CompCodeVet on two open-source code datasets shows that CompCodeVet has the ability to improve the training dataset quality for LLMs. ",

Prior works show that ChatGPT has the capabilities of processing foundational code analysis tasks, such as abstract syntax tree generation, which indicates the potential of using ChatGPT to comprehend code syntax and static behaviors. However, it is unclear whether ChatGPT can complete more complicated real-world vulnerability management tasks, such as the prediction of security relevance and patch correctness, which require an all-encompassing understanding of various aspects, including code syntax, program semantics, and related manual comments. In this paper, we explore ChatGPT's capabilities on 6 tasks involving the complete vulnerability management process with a large-scale dataset containing 78,445 samples. For each task, we compare ChatGPT against SOTA approaches, investigate the impact of different prompts, and explore the difficulties. The results suggest promising potential in leveraging ChatGPT to assist vulnerability management. One notable example is ChatGPT's proficiency in tasks like generating titles for software bug reports. Furthermore, our findings reveal the difficulties encountered by ChatGPT and shed light on promising future directions. For instance, directly providing random demonstration examples in the prompt cannot consistently guarantee good performance in vulnerability management. By contrast, leveraging ChatGPT in a self-heuristic way -- extracting expertise from demonstration examples itself and integrating the extracted expertise in the prompt is a promising research direction. Besides, ChatGPT may misunderstand and misuse the information in the prompt. Consequently, effectively guiding ChatGPT to focus on helpful information rather than the irrelevant content is still an open problem. ",

Recent research predominantly uses geometric graphs to represent these interactions, which are then captured by powerful graph neural networks (GNNs). However, predicting interacting dynamics in challenging scenarios such as out-of-distribution shift and complicated underlying rules remains unsolved. In this paper, we propose a new approach named Graph ODE with factorized prototypes (GOAT) to address the problem. The core of GOAT is to incorporate factorized prototypes from contextual knowledge into a continuous graph ODE framework. Specifically, GOAT employs representation disentanglement and system parameters to extract both object-level and system-level contexts from historical trajectories, which allows us to explicitly model their independent influence and thus enhances the generalization capability under system changes. Then, we integrate these disentangled latent representations into a graph ODE model, which determines a combination of various interacting prototypes for enhanced model expressivity. The entire model is optimized using an end-to-end variational inference framework to maximize the likelihood. Extensive experiments in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings validate the superiority of GOAT. ",

Using Adalm Pluto based software defined radios to implement the secret-key based signalling methods, we show that robust ML models can be designed at the base-stations.

Thus, we use a federated learning framework in the backhaul network, wherein a group of base-stations that need to protect their clients against reactive injection threats collaborate to refine their ML models by ensuring privacy on their datasets. Using a network of XBee devices to implement the backhaul network, experimental results on our federated learning setup shows significant enhancements in the detection accuracy, thus presenting wireless security as an excellent use-case for federated learning in 6G networks and beyond.

    "abstract": "Causal disentanglement has great potential for capturing complex situations. However, there is a lack of practical and efficient approaches. It is already known that most unsupervised disentangling methods are unable to produce identifiable results without additional information, often leading to randomly disentangled output. Therefore, most existing models for disentangling are weakly supervised, providing information about intrinsic factors, which incurs excessive costs. Therefore, we propose a novel model, SCADI(SElf-supervised CAusal DIsentanglement), that enables the model to discover semantic factors and learn their causal relationships without any supervision. This model combines a masked structural causal model (SCM) with a pseudo-label generator for causal disentanglement, aiming to provide a new direction for self-supervised causal disentanglement models.

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have garnered substantial attention in brain-like computing for their biological fidelity and the capacity to execute energy-efficient spike-driven operations. As the demand for heightened performance in SNNs surges, the trend towards training deeper networks becomes imperative, while residual learning stands as a pivotal method for training deep neural networks. In our investigation, we identified that the SEW-ResNet, a prominent representative of deep residual spiking neural networks, incorporates non-event-driven operations. To rectify this, we introduce the OR Residual connection (ORRC) to the architecture. Additionally, we propose the Synergistic Attention (SynA) module, an amalgamation of the Inhibitory Attention (IA) module and the Multi-dimensional Attention (MA) module, to offset energy loss stemming from high quantization. When integrating SynA into the network, we observed the phenomenon of \"natural pruning\", where after training, some or all of the shortcuts in the network naturally drop out without affecting the model's classification accuracy. This significantly reduces computational overhead and makes it more suitable for deployment on edge devices. Experimental results on various public datasets confirmed that the SynA enhanced OR-Spiking ResNet achieved single-sample classification with as little as 0.8 spikes per neuron. Moreover, when compared to other spike residual models, it exhibited higher accuracy and lower power consumption. Codes are available at https://github.com/Ym-Shan/ORRC-SynA-natural-pruning. ",

    "abstract": "Categorizing source codes accurately and efficiently is a challenging problem in real-world programming education platform management. In recent years, model-based approaches utilizing abstract syntax trees (ASTs) have been widely applied to code classification tasks. We introduce an approach named the Sparse Attention-based neural network for Code Classification (SACC) in this paper. The approach involves two main steps: In the first step, source code undergoes syntax parsing and preprocessing. The generated abstract syntax tree is split into sequences of subtrees and then encoded using a recursive neural network to obtain a high-dimensional representation. This step simultaneously considers both the logical structure and lexical level information contained within the code. In the second step, the encoded sequences of subtrees are fed into a Transformer model that incorporates sparse attention mechanisms for the purpose of classification. This method efficiently reduces the computational cost of the self-attention mechanisms, thus improving the training speed while preserving effectiveness. Our work introduces a carefully designed sparse attention pattern that is specifically designed to meet the unique needs of code classification tasks. This design helps reduce the influence of redundant information and enhances the overall performance of the model. Finally, we also deal with problems in previous related research, which include issues like incomplete classification labels and a small dataset size. We annotated the CodeNet dataset with algorithm-related labeling categories, which contains a significantly large amount of data. Extensive comparative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SACC for the code classification tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Implementing intelligent control of robots is a difficult task, especially when dealing with complex black-box systems, because of the lack of visibility and understanding of how these robots work internally. This paper proposes an Intelligent Social Learning (ISL) algorithm to enable intelligent control of black-box robotic systems. Inspired by mutual learning among individuals in human social groups, ISL includes learning, imitation, and self-study styles. Individuals in the learning style use the Levy flight search strategy to learn from the best performer and form the closest relationships. In the imitation style, individuals mimic the best performer with a second-level rapport by employing a random perturbation strategy. In the self-study style, individuals learn independently using a normal distribution sampling method while maintaining a distant relationship with the best performer. Individuals in the population are regarded as autonomous intelligent agents in each style. Neural networks perform strategic actions in three styles to interact with the environment and the robot and iteratively optimize the network policy. Overall, ISL builds on the principles of intelligent optimization, incorporating ideas from reinforcement learning, and possesses strong search capabilities, fast computation speed, fewer hyperparameters, and insensitivity to sparse rewards. The proposed ISL algorithm is compared with four state-of-the-art methods on six continuous control benchmark cases in MuJoCo to verify its effectiveness and advantages. Furthermore, ISL is adopted in the simulation and experimental grasping tasks of the UR3 robot for validations, and satisfactory solutions are yielded. ",

However, using a single neural network to capture patterns of all variables requires a large enough size of networks, leading to a long time of training and still high computational costs. In this paper, we utilize the interfacing of PINNs with symbolic techniques to construct multiple single-output neural networks by taking the loss function apart and integrating it over the relevant domain. Also, we reweigh the factors of the components in the loss function to improve the performance of the network for instability systems. Our results show that the symbolic PINNs provide higher accuracy with significantly fewer parameters and faster training time. By using the adaptive weight method, the symbolic PINNs can avoid the vanishing gradient problem and numerical instability. ",

We try to understand this seemingly strange phenomenon using the robustness of the neural network. Using a robustness viewpoint, we show that the popular $l_2$ weight norm (metric) of the neural network is actually a sufficient condition for grokking. As we also empirically find that $l_2$ norm correlates with grokking on the test data not in a timely way, we propose new metrics based on robustness and information theory and find that our new metrics correlate well with the grokking phenomenon. Based on the previous observations, we propose methods to speed up the generalization process. In addition, we examine the standard training process on modulo addition dataset and find that it hardly learns other basic group operations before grokking, including the commutative law. Interestingly, the speed up of generalization when using our proposed method can be partially explained by learning the commutative law, a necessary condition when the model groks on test dataset. ",

Vehicle Trajectory Prediction is a pivotal element within numerous applications for highway and road safety. These applications encompass a wide range of use cases, spanning from traffic management and accident prevention to enhancing work-zone safety and optimizing energy conservation. The ability to implement intelligent management in this context has been greatly advanced by the developments in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), alongside the increasing deployment of surveillance cameras across road networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel transformer-based approach for vehicle trajectory prediction for highway safety and surveillance, denoted as VT-Former. In addition to utilizing transformers to capture long-range temporal patterns, a new Graph Attentive Tokenization (GAT) module has been proposed to capture intricate social interactions among vehicles. Combining these two core components culminates in a precise approach for vehicle trajectory prediction. Our study on three benchmark datasets with three different viewpoints demonstrates the State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance of VT-Former in vehicle trajectory prediction and its generalizability and robustness. We also evaluate VT-Former's efficiency on embedded boards and explore its potential for vehicle anomaly detection as a sample application, showcasing its broad applicability. ",

In this paper, first, we propose a holistic framework for Medical data Privacy risk analysis and mitigation in Federated Learning (MedPFL) to analyze privacy risks and develop effective mitigation strategies in FL for protecting private medical data. Second, we demonstrate the substantial privacy risks of using FL to process medical images, where adversaries can easily perform privacy attacks to reconstruct private medical images accurately. Third, we show that the defense approach of adding random noises may not always work effectively to protect medical images against privacy attacks in FL, which poses unique and pressing challenges associated with medical data for privacy protection.

We design a modular and comprehensive framework for studying PBNs, which includes different backbone architectures, backbone sizes, and objective functions. Our evaluation protocol assesses the robustness of models against character-, word-, and sentence-level perturbations. Our experiments on three benchmarks show that the robustness of PBNs transfers to NLP classification tasks facing realistic perturbations. Moreover, the robustness of PBNs is supported mostly by the objective function that keeps prototypes interpretable, while the robustness superiority of PBNs over vanilla models becomes more salient as datasets get more complex.

Both representations in terms of $Z$-parameter (impedance) and $S$-parameter (scattering) matrices are widely utilized. In this paper, we embrace multiport network theory for analyzing and optimizing the reradiation properties of RIS-aided channels, and provide four new contributions. (i) First, we offer a thorough comparison between the $Z$-parameter and $S$-parameter representations. This comparison allows us to unveil that the typical scattering models utilized for RIS-aided channels ignore the structural scattering from the RIS, which results in an unwanted specular reflection. (ii) Then, we develop an iterative algorithm for optimizing, in the presence of electromagnetic mutual coupling, the tunable loads of the RIS based on the $S$-parameters representation. We prove that small perturbations of the step size of the algorithm result in larger variations of the $S$-parameter matrix compared with the $Z$-parameter matrix, resulting in a faster convergence rate. (iii) Subsequently, we generalize the proposed algorithm to suppress the specular reflection due to the structural scattering, while maximizing the received power towards the direction of interest, and analyze the effectiveness and tradeoffs of the proposed approach. (iv) Finally, we validate the theoretical findings and algorithms with numerical simulations and a commercial full-wave electromagnetic simulator based on the method of moments. ",

While previous works have mostly focused on fully supervised CoSOD, less attention has been allocated to detecting co-salient objects when limited segmentation annotations are available for training. Our simple yet effective unsupervised method US-CoSOD combines the object co-occurrence frequency statistics of unsupervised single-image semantic segmentations with salient foreground detections using self-supervised feature learning. For the first time, we show that a large unlabeled dataset e.g. ImageNet-1k can be effectively leveraged to significantly improve unsupervised CoSOD performance. Our unsupervised model is a great pre-training initialization for our semi-supervised model SS-CoSOD, especially when very limited labeled data is available for training. To avoid propagating erroneous signals from predictions on unlabeled data, we propose a confidence estimation module to guide our semi-supervised training. Extensive experiments on three CoSOD benchmark datasets show that both of our unsupervised and semi-supervised models outperform the corresponding state-of-the-art models by a significant margin (e.g., on the Cosal2015 dataset, our US-CoSOD model has an 8.8% F-measure gain over a SOTA unsupervised co-segmentation model and our SS-CoSOD model has an 11.81% F-measure gain over a SOTA semi-supervised CoSOD model).

Early detection of melanoma is crucial for improving patient survival rates, but identifying suspicious lesions through ugly duckling (UD) screening, the current method used for skin cancer screening, can be challenging and often requires expertise in pigmented lesions. To address these challenges and improve patient outcomes, an artificial intelligence (AI) decision support tool was developed to assist dermatologists in identifying UD from wide-field patient images. The tool uses a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm to identify and extract all skin lesions from patient images, which are then sorted by suspiciousness using a self-supervised AI algorithm. A clinical validation study was conducted to evaluate the tool's performance, which demonstrated an average sensitivity of 93% for the top-10 AI-identified UDs on skin lesions selected by the majority of experts in pigmented skin lesions. The study also found that dermatologists confidence increased, and the average majority agreement with the top-10 AI-identified UDs improved to 100% when assisted by AI. The development of this AI decision support tool aims to address the shortage of specialists, enable at-risk patients to receive faster consultations and understand the impact of AI-assisted screening. The tool's automation can assist dermatologists in identifying suspicious lesions and provide a more objective assessment, reducing subjectivity in the screening process. The future steps for this project include expanding the dataset to include histologically confirmed melanoma cases and increasing the number of participants for clinical validation to strengthen the tool's reliability and adapt it for real-world consultation.

However, challenges arise due to the UAV's limited onboard energy and the unpredictable status updates from sensor nodes (SNs), which impact the freshness of collected data. In this paper, we investigate the energy-efficient and timely data collection in IoT networks through the use of a solar-powered UAV. Each SN generates status updates at stochastic intervals, while the UAV collects and subsequently transmits these status updates to a central data center. Furthermore, the UAV harnesses solar energy from the environment to maintain its energy level above a predetermined threshold. To minimize both the average age of information (AoI) for SNs and the energy consumption of the UAV, we jointly optimize the UAV trajectory, SN scheduling, and offloading strategy. Then, we formulate this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a meta-reinforcement learning algorithm to enhance the generalization capability. Specifically, the compound-action deep reinforcement learning (CADRL) algorithm is proposed to handle the discrete decisions related to SN scheduling and the UAV's offloading policy, as well as the continuous control of UAV flight. Moreover, we incorporate meta-learning into CADRL to improve the adaptability of the learned policy to new tasks. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms, we conduct extensive simulations and demonstrate their superiority over other baseline algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a novel two-stream network architecture for enhancing scene understanding in computer vision. This architecture utilizes a graph feature stream and an image feature stream, aiming to merge the strengths of both modalities for improved performance in image classification and scene graph generation tasks. The graph feature stream network comprises a segmentation structure, scene graph generation, and a graph representation module. The segmentation structure employs the UPSNet architecture with a backbone that can be a residual network, Vit, or Swin Transformer. The scene graph generation component focuses on extracting object labels and neighborhood relationships from the semantic map to create a scene graph. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) are employed for graph representation, with an emphasis on capturing node features and their interconnections. The image feature stream network, on the other hand, focuses on image classification through the use of Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer models. The two streams are fused using various data fusion methods. This fusion is designed to leverage the complementary strengths of graph-based and image-based features.Experiments conducted on the ADE20K dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two-stream network in improving image classification accuracy compared to conventional methods. This research provides a significant contribution to the field of computer vision, particularly in the areas of scene understanding and image classification, by effectively combining graph-based and image-based approaches.

    "abstract": "Reasoning is a distinctive human capacity, enabling us to address complex problems by breaking them down into a series of manageable cognitive steps. Yet, complex logical reasoning is still cumbersome for language models. Based on the dual process theory in cognitive science, we are the first to unravel the cognitive reasoning abilities of language models. Our framework employs an iterative methodology to construct a Cognitive Tree (CogTree). The root node of this tree represents the initial query, while the leaf nodes consist of straightforward questions that can be answered directly. This construction involves two main components: the implicit extraction module (referred to as the intuitive system) and the explicit reasoning module (referred to as the reflective system). The intuitive system rapidly generates multiple responses by utilizing in-context examples, while the reflective system scores these responses using comparative learning. The scores guide the intuitive system in its subsequent generation step. Our experimental results on two popular and challenging reasoning tasks indicate that it is possible to achieve a performance level comparable to that of GPT-3.5 (with 175B parameters), using a significantly smaller language model that contains fewer parameters (<=7B) than 5% of GPT-3.5.

    "abstract": "Ensuring safety of nonlinear systems under model uncertainty and external disturbances is crucial, especially for real-world control tasks. Predictive methods such as robust model predictive control (RMPC) require solving nonconvex optimization problems online, which leads to high computational burden and poor scalability. Reinforcement learning (RL) works well with complex systems, but pays the price of losing rigorous safety guarantee. This paper presents a theoretical framework that bridges the advantages of both RMPC and RL to synthesize safety filters for nonlinear systems with state- and action-dependent uncertainty. We decompose the robust invariant set (RIS) into two parts: a target set that aligns with terminal region design of RMPC, and a reach-avoid set that accounts for the rest of RIS. We propose a policy iteration approach for robust reach-avoid problems and establish its monotone convergence. This method sets the stage for an adversarial actor-critic deep RL algorithm, which simultaneously synthesizes a reach-avoid policy network, a disturbance policy network, and a reach-avoid value network. The learned reach-avoid policy network is utilized to generate nominal trajectories for online verification, which filters potentially unsafe actions that may drive the system into unsafe regions when worst-case disturbances are applied. We formulate a second-order cone programming (SOCP) approach for online verification using system level synthesis, which optimizes for the worst-case reach-avoid value of any possible trajectories. The proposed safety filter requires much lower computational complexity than RMPC and still enjoys persistent robust safety guarantee. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated through a numerical example. ",

    "abstract": "Graph collaborative filtering, which learns user and item representations through message propagation over the user-item interaction graph, has been shown to effectively enhance recommendation performance. However, most current graph collaborative filtering models mainly construct the interaction graph on a single behavior domain (e.g. click), even though users exhibit various types of behaviors on real-world platforms, including actions like click, cart, and purchase. Furthermore, due to variations in user engagement, there exists an imbalance in the scale of different types of behaviors. For instance, users may click and view multiple items but only make selective purchases from a small subset of them. How to alleviate the behavior imbalance problem and utilize information from the multiple behavior graphs concurrently to improve the target behavior conversion (e.g. purchase) remains underexplored. To this end, we propose IMGCF, a simple but effective model to alleviate behavior data imbalance for multi-behavior graph collaborative filtering. Specifically, IMGCF utilizes a multi-task learning framework for collaborative filtering on multi-behavior graphs. Then, to mitigate the data imbalance issue, IMGCF improves representation learning on the sparse behavior by leveraging representations learned from the behavior domain with abundant data volumes. Experiments on two widely-used multi-behavior datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of IMGCF. ",

    "abstract": "In the anomaly detection field, the scarcity of anomalous samples has directed the current research emphasis towards unsupervised anomaly detection. While these unsupervised anomaly detection methods offer convenience, they also overlook the crucial prior information embedded within anomalous samples. Moreover, among numerous deep learning methods, supervised methods generally exhibit superior performance compared to unsupervised methods. Considering the reasons mentioned above, we propose a self-supervised anomaly detection approach that combines contrastive learning with 2D-Flow to achieve more precise detection outcomes and expedited inference processes. On one hand, we introduce a novel approach to anomaly synthesis, yielding anomalous samples in accordance with authentic industrial scenarios, alongside their surrogate annotations. On the other hand, having obtained a substantial number of anomalous samples, we enhance the 2D-Flow framework by incorporating contrastive learning, leveraging diverse proxy tasks to fine-tune the network. Our approach enables the network to learn more precise mapping relationships from self-generated labels while retaining the lightweight characteristics of the 2D-Flow. Compared to mainstream unsupervised approaches, our self-supervised method demonstrates superior detection accuracy, fewer additional model parameters, and faster inference speed. Furthermore, the entire training and inference process is end-to-end. Our approach showcases new state-of-the-art results, achieving a performance of 99.6\\% in image-level AUROC on the MVTecAD dataset and 96.8\\% in image-level AUROC on the BTAD dataset. ",

Previous work primarily used 2D information as input, but multi-modal industrial anomaly detection based on 3D point clouds and RGB images is just beginning to emerge. The regular approach involves utilizing large pre-trained models for feature representation and storing them in memory banks. However, the above methods require a longer inference time and higher memory usage, which cannot meet the real-time requirements of the industry. To overcome these issues, we propose a lightweight dual-branch reconstruction network(DBRN) based on RGB-D input, learning the decision boundary between normal and abnormal examples. The requirement for alignment between the two modalities is eliminated by using depth maps instead of point cloud input. Furthermore, we introduce an importance scoring module in the discriminative network to assist in fusing features from these two modalities, thereby obtaining a comprehensive discriminative result. DBRN achieves 92.8% AUROC with high inference efficiency on the MVTec 3D-AD dataset without large pre-trained models and memory banks. ",

In this paper, we are interested in the robustness of a QR system to questions varying in rewriting hardness or difficulty. Since there is a lack of questions classified based on their rewriting hardness, we first propose a heuristic method to automatically classify questions into subsets of varying hardness, by measuring the discrepancy between a question and its rewrite. To find out what makes questions hard or easy for rewriting, we then conduct a human evaluation to annotate the rewriting hardness of questions. Finally, to enhance the robustness of QR systems to questions of varying hardness, we propose a novel learning framework for QR that first trains a QR model independently on each subset of questions of a certain level of hardness, then combines these QR models as one joint model for inference. Experimental results on two datasets show that our framework improves the overall performance compared to the baselines. ",

Their performance can significantly deteriorate when users' actual viewing patterns and QoE preferences differ considerably from those observed during the training phase, resulting in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose MANSY, a novel streaming system that embraces user diversity to improve generalization. Specifically, to accommodate users' diverse viewing patterns, we design a Transformer-based viewport prediction model with an efficient multi-viewport trajectory input output architecture based on implicit ensemble learning. Besides, we for the first time combine the advanced representation learning and deep reinforcement learning to train the bitrate selection model to maximize diverse QoE objectives, enabling the model to generalize across users with diverse preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MANSY outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in viewport prediction accuracy and QoE improvement on both trained and unseen viewing patterns and QoE preferences, achieving better generalization.

    "abstract": "This paper considers an under-explored Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) task, namely open-set GAD, which aims to detect anomalous nodes using a small number of labelled training normal and anomaly nodes (known as seen anomalies) that cannot illustrate all possible inference-time abnormalities. The task has attracted growing attention due to the availability of anomaly prior knowledge from the label information that can help to substantially reduce detection errors. However, current methods tend to over-emphasise fitting the seen anomalies, leading to a weak generalisation ability to detect unseen anomalies, i.e., those that are not illustrated by the labelled anomaly nodes. Further, they were introduced to handle Euclidean data, failing to effectively capture important non-Euclidean features for GAD. In this work, we propose a novel open-set GAD approach, namely normal structure regularisation (NSReg), to leverage the rich normal graph structure embedded in the labelled nodes to tackle the aforementioned two issues. In particular, NSReg trains an anomaly-discriminative supervised graph anomaly detector, with a plug-and-play regularisation term to enforce compact, semantically-rich representations of normal nodes. To this end, the regularisation is designed to differentiate various types of normal nodes, including labelled normal nodes that are connected in their local neighbourhood, and those that are not connected. By doing so, it helps incorporate strong normality into the supervised anomaly detector learning, mitigating their overfitting to the seen anomalies. Extensive empirical results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed NSReg for open-set GAD. ",

To allow each data owner (a.k.a., FL clients) to train a heterogeneous and personalized local model based on its local data distribution, system resources and requirements on model structure, the field of model-heterogeneous personalized federated learning (MHPFL) has emerged. Existing MHPFL approaches either rely on the availability of a public dataset with special characteristics to facilitate knowledge transfer, incur high computation and communication costs, or face potential model leakage risks. To address these limitations, we propose a model-heterogeneous personalized Federated learning approach based on feature Extractor Sharing (pFedES). It incorporates a small homogeneous feature extractor into each client's heterogeneous local model. Clients train them via the proposed iterative learning method to enable the exchange of global generalized knowledge and local personalized knowledge. The small local homogeneous extractors produced after local training are uploaded to the FL server and for aggregation to facilitate easy knowledge sharing among clients. We theoretically prove that pFedES can converge over wall-to-wall time. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets against six state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that pFedES builds the most accurate model, while incurring low communication and computation costs. Compared with the best-performing baseline, it achieves 1.61% higher test accuracy, while reducing communication and computation costs by 99.6% and 82.9%, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP) has seen immense applications in learning on tabular, image, and sequential data where instance-level privacy is concerned. In learning on graphs, contrastingly, works on node-level privacy are highly sparse. Challenges arise as existing DP protocols hardly apply to the message-passing mechanism in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this study, we propose a solution that specifically addresses the issue of node-level privacy. Our protocol consists of two main components: 1) a sampling routine called HeterPoisson, which employs a specialized node sampling strategy and a series of tailored operations to generate a batch of sub-graphs with desired properties, and 2) a randomization routine that utilizes symmetric multivariate Laplace (SML) noise instead of the commonly used Gaussian noise. Our privacy accounting shows this particular combination provides a non-trivial privacy guarantee. In addition, our protocol enables GNN learning with good performance, as demonstrated by experiments on five real-world datasets; compared with existing baselines, our method shows significant advantages, especially in the high privacy regime. Experimentally, we also 1) perform membership inference attacks against our protocol and 2) apply privacy audit techniques to confirm our protocol's privacy integrity. In the sequel, we present a study on a seemingly appealing approach \\cite{sajadmanesh2023gap} (USENIX'23) that protects node-level privacy via differentially private node/instance embeddings. Unfortunately, such work has fundamental privacy flaws, which are identified through a thorough case study. More importantly, we prove an impossibility result of achieving both (strong) privacy and (acceptable) utility through private instance embedding. The implication is that such an approach has intrinsic utility barriers when enforcing differential privacy. ",

    "title": "More Than 50% Of The Time, Users Detect Real SMS as Fake: A Smishing  Detection Study Of US Population",
    "abstract": "With the booming popularity of smartphones, threats related to these devices are increasingly on the rise. Smishing, a combination of SMS (Short Message Service) and phishing has emerged as a treacherous cyber threat used by malicious actors to deceive users, aiming to steal sensitive information, money or install malware on their mobile devices. Despite the increase in smishing attacks in recent years, there are very few studies aimed at understanding the factors that contribute to a user's ability to differentiate real from fake messages. To address this gap in knowledge, we have conducted an online survey on smishing detection with 214 participants. In this study, we presented them with 16 SMS screenshots and evaluated how different factors affect their decision making process in smishing detection. Next, we conducted a follow-up survey to garner information on the participants' security attitudes, behavior and knowledge. Our results highlighted that attention and security behavioral scores had a significant impact on participants' accuracy identifying smishing messages. Interestingly, we found that participants had more difficulty identifying real messages from fake ones, with an accuracy of 64% with fake messages and 46\\% with real messages. Understanding these factors is pivotal to bolstering users' resilience against these threats and to create a safer digital environment. ",

    "abstract": "Video caching can significantly improve backhaul traffic congestion by locally storing the popular content that users frequently request. A privacy-preserving method is desirable to learn how users' demands change over time. As such, this paper proposes a novel resource-aware hierarchical federated learning (RawHFL) solution to predict users' future content requests under the realistic assumptions that content requests are sporadic and users' datasets can only be updated based on the requested content's information. Considering a partial client participation case, we first derive the upper bound of the global gradient norm that depends on the clients' local training rounds and the successful reception of their accumulated gradients over the wireless links. Under delay, energy and radio resource constraints, we then optimize client selection and their local rounds and central processing unit (CPU) frequencies to minimize a weighted utility function that facilitates RawHFL's convergence in an energy-efficient way. Our simulation results show that the proposed solution significantly outperforms the considered baselines in terms of prediction accuracy and total energy expenditure. ",

We first prove the equivalence for four uncertainty sets: ellipsoidal, box, diamond, and budget, and provide closed-form formulations of the penalty term as a function of the sample size, feature size, as well as perturbation protection strength. We then show in synthetic datasets with different levels of perturbations, a consistent improvement of the averaged formulation over the existing worst-case formulation in out-of-sample performance.

The ability of batch normalization in addressing the scalability limitations of the MILP formulation is also highlighted.

    "abstract": "The recent development of deep learning methods applied to vision has enabled their increasing integration into real-world applications to perform complex Computer Vision (CV) tasks. However, image acquisition conditions have a major impact on the performance of high-level image processing. A possible solution to overcome these limitations is to artificially augment the training databases or to design deep learning models that are robust to signal distortions. We opt here for the first solution by enriching the database with complex and realistic distortions which were ignored until now in the existing databases. To this end, we built a new versatile database derived from the well-known MS-COCO database to which we applied local and global photo-realistic distortions. These new local distortions are generated by considering the scene context of the images that guarantees a high level of photo-realism. Distortions are generated by exploiting the depth information of the objects in the scene as well as their semantics. This guarantees a high level of photo-realism and allows to explore real scenarios ignored in conventional databases dedicated to various CV applications. Our versatile database offers an efficient solution to improve the robustness of various CV tasks such as Object Detection (OD), scene segmentation, and distortion-type classification methods. The image database, scene classification index, and distortion generation codes are publicly available \\footnote{\\url{https://github.com/Aymanbegh/CD-COCO}} ",

    "abstract": "Parallel programs are frequently modeled as dependency or cost graphs, which can be used to detect various bugs, or simply to visualize the parallel structure of the code. However, such graphs reflect just one particular execution and are typically constructed in a post-hoc manner. Graph types, which were introduced recently to mitigate this problem, can be assigned statically to a program by a type system and compactly represent the family of all graphs that could result from the program. Unfortunately, prior work is restricted in its treatment of futures, an increasingly common and especially dynamic form of parallelism. In short, each instance of a future must be statically paired with a vertex name. Previously, this led to the restriction that futures could not be placed in collections or be used to construct data structures. Doing so is not a niche exercise: such structures form the basis of numerous algorithms that use forms of pipelining to achieve performance not attainable without futures. All but the most limited of these examples are out of reach of prior graph type systems. In this paper, we propose a graph type system that allows for almost arbitrary combinations of futures and recursive data types. We do so by indexing datatypes with a type-level vertex structure, a codata structure that supplies unique vertex names to the futures in a data structure. We prove the soundness of the system in a parallel core calculus annotated with vertex structures and associated operations. Although the calculus is annotated, this is merely for convenience in defining the type system. We prove that it is possible to annotate arbitrary recursive types with vertex structures, and show using a prototype inference engine that these annotations can be inferred from OCaml-like source code for several complex parallel algorithms.

Therefore, this work investigates whether LLMs can teach themselves to reason without human-crafted demonstrations. We propose SELF-EXPLAIN to generate CoT examples by LLMs inspired by \"encoding specificity\" in human memory retrieval. We find using self-explanations makes LLMs more confident, more calibrated and less biased when answering complex questions.

    "abstract": "The collaborative nature of federated learning (FL) poses a major threat in the form of manipulation of local training data and local updates, known as the Byzantine poisoning attack. To address this issue, many Byzantine-robust aggregation rules (AGRs) have been proposed to filter out or moderate suspicious local updates uploaded by Byzantine participants. This paper introduces a novel approach called AGRAMPLIFIER, aiming to simultaneously improve the robustness, fidelity, and efficiency of the existing AGRs. The core idea of AGRAMPLIFIER is to amplify the \"morality\" of local updates by identifying the most repressive features of each gradient update, which provides a clearer distinction between malicious and benign updates, consequently improving the detection effect. To achieve this objective, two approaches, namely AGRMP and AGRXAI, are proposed. AGRMP organizes local updates into patches and extracts the largest value from each patch, while AGRXAI leverages explainable AI methods to extract the gradient of the most activated features. By equipping AGRAMPLIFIER with the existing Byzantine-robust mechanisms, we successfully enhance the model's robustness, maintaining its fidelity and improving overall efficiency. AGRAMPLIFIER is universally compatible with the existing Byzantine-robust mechanisms. The paper demonstrates its effectiveness by integrating it with all mainstream AGR mechanisms. Extensive evaluations conducted on seven datasets from diverse domains against seven representative poisoning attacks consistently show enhancements in robustness, fidelity, and efficiency, with average gains of 40.08%, 39.18%, and 10.68%, respectively.

However, current approaches are inherently limited to a closed-set setting and may struggle in open-world applications where there can be anomaly categories in the test data unseen during training. A few recent studies attempt to tackle a more realistic setting, open-set VAD, which aims to detect unseen anomalies given seen anomalies and normal videos. However, such a setting focuses on predicting frame anomaly scores, having no ability to recognize the specific categories of anomalies, despite the fact that this ability is essential for building more informed video surveillance systems. This paper takes a step further and explores open-vocabulary video anomaly detection (OVVAD), in which we aim to leverage pre-trained large models to detect and categorize seen and unseen anomalies. To this end, we propose a model that decouples OVVAD into two mutually complementary tasks -- class-agnostic detection and class-specific classification -- and jointly optimizes both tasks. Particularly, we devise a semantic knowledge injection module to introduce semantic knowledge from large language models for the detection task, and design a novel anomaly synthesis module to generate pseudo unseen anomaly videos with the help of large vision generation models for the classification task. These semantic knowledge and synthesis anomalies substantially extend our model's capability in detecting and categorizing a variety of seen and unseen anomalies. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on OVVAD task. ",

In this case, the resource-constrained in-vehicle network (IVN) is facing a wide variety of complex and changing external cyber-attacks, especially the masquerade attack with high difficulty of detection while serious damaging effects that few counter measures can identify successfully. Moreover, only coarse-grained recognition can be achieved in current mainstream intrusion detection mechanisms, i.e., whether a whole data flow observation window contains attack labels rather than fine-grained recognition on every single data item within this window. In this paper, we propose StatGraph: an Effective Multi-view Statistical Graph Learning Intrusion Detection to implement the fine-grained intrusion detection. Specifically, StatGraph generates two statistical graphs, timing correlation graph (TCG) and coupling relationship graph (CRG), based on data streams. In given message observation windows, edge attributes in TCGs represent temporal correlation between different message IDs, while edge attributes in CRGs denote the neighbour relationship and contextual similarity. Besides, a lightweight shallow layered GCN network is trained based graph property of TCGs and CRGs, which can learn the universal laws of various patterns more effectively and further enhance the performance of detection. To address the problem of insufficient attack types in previous intrusion detection, we select two real in-vehicle CAN datasets that cover four new attacks never investigated before. Experimental result shows StatGraph improves both detection granularity and detection performance over state-of-the-art intrusion detection methods. ",

Although joint automatic speech recognition (ASR) and accent recognition (AR) training has been proven effective in handling multi-accent scenarios, current multi-task ASR-AR approaches overlook the granularity differences between tasks. Fine-grained units capture pronunciation-related accent characteristics, while coarse-grained units are better for learning linguistic information. Moreover, an explicit interaction of two tasks can also provide complementary information and improve the performance of each other, but it is rarely used by existing approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel Decoupling and Interacting Multi-task Network (DIMNet) for joint speech and accent recognition, which is comprised of a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) branch, an AR branch, an ASR branch, and a bottom feature encoder. Specifically, AR and ASR are first decoupled by separated branches and two-granular modeling units to learn task-specific representations. The AR branch is from our previously proposed linguistic-acoustic bimodal AR model and the ASR branch is an encoder-decoder based Conformer model. Then, for the task interaction, the CTC branch provides aligned text for the AR task, while accent embeddings extracted from our AR model are incorporated into the ASR branch's encoder and decoder. Finally, during ASR inference, a cross-granular rescoring method is introduced to fuse the complementary information from the CTC and attention decoder after the decoupling. Our experiments on English and Chinese datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which achieves 21.45%/28.53% AR accuracy relative improvement and 32.33%/14.55% ASR error rate relative reduction over a published standard baseline, respectively.

    "abstract": "DeepFake detection is pivotal in personal privacy and public safety. With the iterative advancement of DeepFake techniques, high-quality forged videos and images are becoming increasingly deceptive. Prior research has seen numerous attempts by scholars to incorporate biometric features into the field of DeepFake detection. However, traditional biometric-based approaches tend to segregate biometric features from general ones and freeze the biometric feature extractor. These approaches resulted in the exclusion of valuable general features, potentially leading to a performance decline and, consequently, a failure to fully exploit the potential of biometric information in assisting DeepFake detection. Moreover, insufficient attention has been dedicated to scrutinizing gaze authenticity within the realm of DeepFake detection in recent years. In this paper, we introduce GazeForensics, an innovative DeepFake detection method that utilizes gaze representation obtained from a 3D gaze estimation model to regularize the corresponding representation within our DeepFake detection model, while concurrently integrating general features to further enhance the performance of our model. Experiment results reveal that our proposed GazeForensics outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. ",

Currently, different multi-robot collaborative path planning methods have been proposed, but how to process the sensory information of neighboring robots at different locations from a local perception perspective in real environment to make better decisions is still a major difficulty. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-robot collaborative path planning method based on geometric graph neural network (GeoGNN). GeoGNN introduces the relative position information of neighboring robots into each interaction layer of the graph neural network to better integrate neighbor sensing information. An expert data generation method is designed for the robot to advance in a single step, by which expert data are generated in ROS to train the network. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed method is improved by about 5% compared to the model based only on CNN on the expert data set. In ROS simulation environment path planning test, the success rate is improved by about 4% compared to CNN and flowtime increase is reduced about 8%, which outperforms other graph neural network models.

    "abstract": "(Source) code search is widely concerned by software engineering researchers because it can improve the productivity and quality of software development. Given a functionality requirement usually described in a natural language sentence, a code search system can retrieve code snippets that satisfy the requirement from a large-scale code corpus, e.g., GitHub. To realize effective and efficient code search, many techniques have been proposed successively. These techniques improve code search performance mainly by optimizing three core components, including query understanding component, code understanding component, and query-code matching component. In this paper, we provide a 3-dimensional perspective survey for code search. Specifically, we categorize existing code search studies into query-end optimization techniques, code-end optimization techniques, and match-end optimization techniques according to the specific components they optimize. Considering that each end can be optimized independently and contributes to the code search performance, we treat each end as a dimension. Therefore, this survey is 3-dimensional in nature, and it provides a comprehensive summary of each dimension in detail. To understand the research trends of the three dimensions in existing code search studies, we systematically review 68 relevant literatures. Different from existing code search surveys that only focus on the query end or code end or introduce various aspects shallowly (including codebase, evaluation metrics, modeling technique, etc.), our survey provides a more nuanced analysis and review of the evolution and development of the underlying techniques used in the three ends. Based on a systematic review and summary of existing work, we outline several open challenges and opportunities at the three ends that remain to be addressed in future work. ",

    "abstract": "The global deployment of the phasor measurement units (PMUs) enables real-time monitoring of the power system, which has stimulated considerable research into machine learning-based models for event detection and classification. However, recent studies reveal that machine learning-based methods are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can fool the event classifiers by adding small perturbations to the raw PMU data. To mitigate the threats posed by adversarial attacks, research on defense strategies is urgently needed. This paper proposes an effective adversarial purification method based on the diffusion model to counter adversarial attacks on the machine learning-based power system event classifier. The proposed method includes two steps: injecting noise into the PMU data; and utilizing a pre-trained neural network to eliminate the added noise while simultaneously removing perturbations introduced by the adversarial attacks. The proposed adversarial purification method significantly increases the accuracy of the event classifier under adversarial attacks while satisfying the requirements of real-time operations. In addition, the theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed diffusion model-based adversarial purification method decreases the distance between the original and compromised PMU data, which reduces the impacts of adversarial attacks. The empirical results on a large-scale real-world PMU dataset validate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of the proposed adversarial purification method. ",

    "abstract": "The rise of online social networks has facilitated the evolution of social recommender systems, which incorporate social relations to enhance users' decision-making process. With the great success of Graph Neural Networks in learning node representations, GNN-based social recommendations have been widely studied to model user-item interactions and user-user social relations simultaneously. Despite their great successes, recent studies have shown that these advanced recommender systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which attackers can inject well-designed fake user profiles to disrupt recommendation performances. While most existing studies mainly focus on targeted attacks to promote target items on vanilla recommender systems, untargeted attacks to degrade the overall prediction performance are less explored on social recommendations under a black-box scenario. To perform untargeted attacks on social recommender systems, attackers can construct malicious social relationships for fake users to enhance the attack performance. However, the coordination of social relations and item profiles is challenging for attacking black-box social recommendations. To address this limitation, we first conduct several preliminary studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-community connections and cold-start items in degrading recommendations performance. Specifically, we propose a novel framework Multiattack based on multi-agent reinforcement learning to coordinate the generation of cold-start item profiles and cross-community social relations for conducting untargeted attacks on black-box social recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attacking framework under the black-box setting. ",

While several promising methods for removing attribute bias in neural networks have been proposed, their limitations remain under-explored. To that end, in this work, we mathematically and empirically reveal the limitation of existing attribute bias removal methods in presence of strong bias and propose a new method that can mitigate this limitation. Specifically, we first derive a general non-vacuous information-theoretical upper bound on the performance of any attribute bias removal method in terms of the bias strength, revealing that they are effective only when the inherent bias in the dataset is relatively weak. Next, we derive a necessary condition for the existence of any method that can remove attribute bias regardless of the bias strength. Inspired by this condition, we then propose a new method using an adversarial objective that directly filters out protected attributes in the input space while maximally preserving all other attributes, without requiring any specific target label. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both strong and moderate bias settings. We provide extensive experiments on synthetic, image, and census datasets, to verify the derived theoretical bound and its consequences in practice, and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in removing strong attribute bias.

Then we train it in the simplest way to minimize its dependency and strengthen its portability. Though simple in construction and training, the proposed DAL paradigm not only substantially pushes the performance boundary but also provides a superior trade-off between speed and accuracy among all existing methods.

Our experimental results show that the proposed tiling method can boost the F1-score by up to 225% while reducing the average object count error by up to 76%. Furthermore, the findings of this work suggest that using a soft F1 loss over the popular binary cross-entropy loss can significantly reduce the negative impact of imbalanced data.

Because the depth ground-truth is unavailable in the training phase, we develop a pseudo ground-truth diffusion process to assist the diffusion in MonoDiffusion. The pseudo ground-truth diffusion gradually adds noise to the depth map generated by a pre-trained teacher model. Moreover,the teacher model allows applying a distillation loss to guide the denoised depth. Further, we develop a masked visual condition mechanism to enhance the denoising ability of model.

Another common objective is the semantic segmentation of moving road users. These two problems are handled strictly separate from each other in literature. The employed neural networks are always focused entirely on only one of the tasks. In contrast to this, we examine ways to solve both tasks at the same time with a single jointly used model. In addition to a new augmented multi-head architecture, we also devise a method to represent a network's predictions for the two tasks with only one output value. This novel approach allows us to solve the tasks simultaneously with the same inference time as a conventional task-specific model.

Instead, here we address video description of manipulation actions where different levels of detail are required for being able to convey information about the hierarchical structure of these actions relevant also for modern approaches of robot learning. We propose one hybrid statistical and one end-to-end framework to address this problem. The hybrid method needs much less data for training, because it models statistically uncertainties within the video clips, while in the end-to-end method, which is more data-heavy, we are directly connecting the visual encoder to the language decoder without any intermediate (statistical) processing step. Both frameworks use LSTM stacks to allow for different levels of description granularity and videos can be described by simple single-sentences or complex multiple-sentence descriptions.

    "abstract": "Text mining research has grown in importance in recent years due to the tremendous increase in the volume of unstructured textual data. This has resulted in immense potential as well as obstacles in the sector, which may be efficiently addressed with adequate analytical and study methods. Deep Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks are used in this study to analyze sentiment. The method is categorized as sentiment polarity analysis because it may generate a dataset with sentiment labels. This dataset can be used to train and evaluate sentiment analysis models capable of extracting impartial opinions. This paper describes the Sentiment Analysis-Deep Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (SA-BDRNN) Scheme, which seeks to overcome the challenges and maximize the potential of text mining in the context of Big Data. The current study proposes a SA-DBRNN Scheme that attempts to give a systematic framework for sentiment analysis in the context of student input on institution choice. The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the proposed SA- DBRNN Scheme to existing frameworks to establish a robust deep neural network that might serve as an adequate classification model in the field of sentiment analysis.

    "abstract": "Recently, large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior language understanding abilities, including zero-shot causal reasoning. However, it is unclear to what extent their capabilities are similar to human ones. We here study the processing of an event $B$ in a script-based story, which causally depends on a previous event $A$. In our manipulation, event $A$ is stated, negated, or omitted in an earlier section of the text. We first conducted a self-paced reading experiment, which showed that humans exhibit significantly longer reading times when causal conflicts exist ($\\neg A \\rightarrow B$) than under logical conditions ($A \\rightarrow B$). However, reading times remain similar when cause A is not explicitly mentioned, indicating that humans can easily infer event B from their script knowledge. We then tested a variety of LLMs on the same data to check to what extent the models replicate human behavior. Our experiments show that 1) only recent LLMs, like GPT-3 or Vicuna, correlate with human behavior in the $\\neg A \\rightarrow B$ condition. 2) Despite this correlation, all models still fail to predict that $nil \\rightarrow B$ is less surprising than $\\neg A \\rightarrow B$, indicating that LLMs still have difficulties integrating script knowledge.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable results for various computer vision tasks, including the realm of medical imaging. However, their application in the medical domain is limited due to the requirement for large amounts of training data, which can be both challenging and expensive to obtain. To mitigate this, pre-trained models have been fine-tuned on domain-specific data, but such an approach can suffer from inductive biases. Furthermore, deep learning models struggle to learn the relationship between spatially distant features and their importance, as convolution operations treat all pixels equally. Pioneering a novel solution to this challenge, we employ the Image Foresting Transform to optimally segment images into superpixels. These superpixels are subsequently transformed into graph-structured data, enabling the proficient extraction of features and modeling of relationships using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our method harnesses an ensemble of three distinct GNN architectures to boost its robustness. In our evaluations targeting pneumonia classification, our methodology surpassed prevailing Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in performance, all while drastically cutting down on the parameter count. This not only trims down the expenses tied to data but also accelerates training and minimizes bias. Consequently, our proposition offers a sturdy, economically viable, and scalable strategy for medical image classification, significantly diminishing dependency on extensive training data sets. ",

    "abstract": "Mathematical formulas serve as the means of communication between humans and nature, encapsulating the operational laws governing natural phenomena. The concise formulation of these laws is a crucial objective in scientific research and an important challenge for artificial intelligence (AI). While traditional artificial neural networks (MLP) excel at data fitting, they often yield uninterpretable black box results that hinder our understanding of the relationship between variables x and predicted values y. Moreover, the fixed network architecture in MLP often gives rise to redundancy in both network structure and parameters. To address these issues, we propose MetaSymNet, a novel neural network that dynamically adjusts its structure in real-time, allowing for both expansion and contraction. This adaptive network employs the PANGU meta function as its activation function, which is a unique type capable of evolving into various basic functions during training to compose mathematical formulas tailored to specific needs. We then evolve the neural network into a concise, interpretable mathematical expression. To evaluate MetaSymNet's performance, we compare it with four state-of-the-art symbolic regression algorithms across more than 10 public datasets comprising 222 formulas. Our experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms others consistently regardless of noise presence or absence. Furthermore, we assess MetaSymNet against MLP and SVM regarding their fitting ability and extrapolation capability, these are two essential aspects of machine learning algorithms. The findings reveal that our algorithm excels in both areas. Finally, we compared MetaSymNet with MLP using iterative pruning in network structure complexity. The results show that MetaSymNet's network structure complexity is obviously less than MLP under the same goodness of fit. ",

Due to the increase in the number of usable wavelengths in multi-band optical networks, the complexity of resource allocation problems becomes a major concern. Moreover, the transmission performance, spectrum width, and cost constraint across optical bands may be heterogeneous. Assuming a worst-case transmission margin in U, L, and C-bands, this paper investigates the problem of throughput maximization in multi-band optical networks, including the optimization of route, wavelength, and band assignment. We propose a low-complexity decomposition approach based on Column Generation (CG) to address the scalability issue faced by traditional methodologies. We numerically compare the results obtained by our CG-based approach to an integer linear programming model, confirming the near-optimal network throughput. Our results also demonstrate the scalability of the CG-based approach when the number of wavelengths increases, with the computation time in the magnitude order of 10 s for cases varying from 75 to 1200 wavelength channels per link in a 14-node network.

Many real-world problems can be cast as graph inference tasks where the graph representation could capture complex relational phenomena (e.g., transactions among financial accounts in a journal entry), along with metadata reflecting tabular features (e.g. approver, effective date, etc.). While numerous anomaly detectors based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been proposed, none are capable of directly handling directed graphs with multi-edges and self-loops. Furthermore, the simultaneous handling of relational and tabular features remains an unexplored area. In this work we propose ADAMM, a novel graph neural network model that handles directed multi-graphs, providing a unified end-to-end architecture that fuses metadata and graph-level representation learning through an unsupervised anomaly detection objective. Experiments on datasets from two different domains, namely, general-ledger journal entries from different firms (accounting) as well as human GPS trajectories from thousands of individuals (urban mobility) validate ADAMM's generality and detection effectiveness of expert-guided and ground-truth anomalies. Notably, ADAMM outperforms existing baselines that handle the two data modalities (graph and metadata) separately with post hoc synthesis efforts. ",

A common practice is to outsource the training process or collect more data over the Internet, which introduces the risks of a backdoored DNN. A backdoored DNN shows normal behavior on clean data while behaving maliciously once a trigger is injected into a sample at the test time. In such cases, the defender faces multiple difficulties. First, the available clean dataset may not be sufficient for fine-tuning and recovering the backdoored DNN. Second, it is impossible to recover the trigger in many real-world applications without information about it. In this paper, we formulate some characteristics of poisoned neurons. This backdoor suspiciousness score can rank network neurons according to their activation values, weights, and their relationship with other neurons in the same layer. Our experiments indicate the proposed method decreases the chance of attacks being successful by more than 50% with a tiny clean dataset, i.e., ten clean samples for the CIFAR-10 dataset, without significantly deteriorating the model's performance.

Firstly, we demonstrate that smaller diffusion steps generate latent representations that are more robust for downstream tasks than larger steps. Secondly, we use this insight to propose an improved esembling scheme that leverages information-dense small steps and the regularising effect of larger steps to generate predictions. Our model shows significantly better performance in domain-shifted settings while retaining competitive performance in-domain.

In this work, we present an intersection access control system based on platoon-forming for heterogeneous autonomous traffic. The heterogeneity of traffic arises from vehicles with different acceleration capabilities and safety constraints. We focus on obtaining computationally fast and interpretable closed-form expressions for safe and efficient vehicle trajectories that lead to platoon formation, and show that these trajectories are solutions to certain classes of optimisation problems. Additionally, we conduct a numerical study to obtain approximations for intersection capacity as a result of such platoon formation. ",

Recently, Kaufmann, Larcher, Lengler and Zou conjectured that for the self-adjusting $(1,\\lambda)$-EA, Adversarial Dynamic BinVal (ADBV) is the hardest dynamic monotone function to optimize. We introduce the function Switching Dynamic BinVal (SDBV) which coincides with ADBV whenever the number of remaining zeros in the search point is strictly less than $n/2$, where $n$ denotes the dimension of the search space. We show, using a combinatorial argument, that for the $(1+1)$-EA with any mutation rate $p \\in [0,1]$, SDBV is drift-minimizing among the class of dynamic monotone functions. Our construction provides the first explicit example of an instance of the partially-ordered evolutionary algorithm (PO-EA) model with parameterized pessimism introduced by Colin, Doerr and F\\'erey, building on work of Jansen. We further show that the $(1+1)$-EA optimizes SDBV in $\\Theta(n^{3/2})$ generations. Our simulations demonstrate matching runtimes for both static and self-adjusting $(1,\\lambda)$ and $(1+\\lambda)$-EA. We further show, using an example of fixed dimension, that drift-minimization does not equal maximal runtime. ",

In this work, we study the stability properties of these simplices. We find that the simplex structure disappears under small adversarial attacks, and that perturbed examples \"leap\" between simplex vertices. We further analyze the geometry of networks that are optimized to be robust against adversarial perturbations of the input, and find that Neural Collapse is a pervasive phenomenon in these cases as well, with clean and perturbed representations forming aligned simplices, and giving rise to a robust simple nearest-neighbor classifier. By studying the propagation of the amount of collapse inside the network, we identify novel properties of both robust and non-robust machine learning models, and show that earlier, unlike later layers maintain reliable simplices on perturbed data.

Rather than exchanging the actual updated model parameters, each node transmits a distance-based similarity measure between the locally updated model and each member of the noise-perturbed model population. Each node, as well as the server, generates an identical population set of perturbed models in a completely synchronized fashion using the same random seeds. With properly chosen noise variance and population size, perturbed models can be combined to closely reflect the actual model updated using the local dataset, allowing the transmitted similarity measures (or fitness values) to carry nearly the complete information about the model parameters. As the population size is typically much smaller than the number of model parameters, the savings in communication load is large. The server aggregates these fitness values and is able to update the global model. This global fitness vector is then disseminated back to the nodes, each of which applies the same update to be synchronized to the global model. Our analysis shows that EvoFed converges, and our experimental results validate that at the cost of increased local processing loads, EvoFed achieves performance comparable to FedAvg while reducing overall communication requirements drastically in various practical settings.

    "abstract": "Iterative differential approximation methods that rely upon backpropagation have enabled the optimization of neural networks; however, at present, they remain computationally expensive, especially when training models at scale. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient alternative for optimizing neural networks that can both reduce the costs of scaling neural networks and provide high-efficiency optimizations for low-resource applications. We derive an explicit solution to a simple feed-forward language model (LM) by mathematically analyzing its gradients. This solution generalizes from single-layer LMs to the class of all single-layer feed-forward softmax-activated neural models trained on positive-valued features, as is demonstrated by our extension of this solution application to MNIST digit classification. For both LM and digit classifiers, we find computationally that explicit solutions perform near-optimality in experiments showing that 1) iterative optimization only marginally improves the explicit solution parameters and 2) randomly initialized parameters iteratively optimize towards the explicit solution. We also preliminarily apply the explicit solution locally by layer in multi-layer networks and discuss how the solution's computational savings increase with model complexity -- for both single- and mult-layer applications of the explicit solution, we emphasize that the optima achieved cannot be reached by backpropagation alone, i.e., better optima appear discoverable only after explicit solutions are applied. Finally, we discuss the solution's computational savings alongside its impact on model interpretability and suggest future directions for the derivation of explicit solutions to complex- and multi-layer architectures.

    "abstract": "Enterprise applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for question answering on enterprise SQL databases. However, the extent to which LLMs can accurately respond to enterprise questions in such databases remains unclear, given the absence of suitable Text-to-SQL benchmarks tailored to enterprise settings. Additionally, the potential of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance LLM-based question answering by providing business context is not well understood. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of LLM-powered question answering systems in the context of enterprise questions and SQL databases, while also exploring the role of knowledge graphs in improving accuracy. To achieve this, we introduce a benchmark comprising an enterprise SQL schema in the insurance domain, a range of enterprise queries encompassing reporting to metrics, and a contextual layer incorporating an ontology and mappings that define a knowledge graph. Our primary finding reveals that question answering using GPT-4, with zero-shot prompts directly on SQL databases, achieves an accuracy of 16%. Notably, this accuracy increases to 54% when questions are posed over a Knowledge Graph representation of the enterprise SQL database. Therefore, investing in Knowledge Graph provides higher accuracy for LLM powered question answering systems. ",

This paper presents an efficient alternative for optimizing neural networks that reduces the costs of scaling neural networks and provides high-efficiency optimizations for low-resource applications. We will discuss a general result about feed-forward neural networks and then extend this solution to compositional (mult-layer) networks, which are applied to a simplified transformer block containing feed-forward and self-attention layers. These models are used to train highly-specified and complex multi-layer neural architectures that we refer to as self-attentive feed-forward unit (SAFFU) layers, which we use to develop a transformer that appears to generalize well over small, cognitively-feasible, volumes of data. Testing demonstrates explicit solutions outperform models optimized by backpropagation alone. Moreover, further application of backpropagation after explicit solutions leads to better optima from smaller scales of data, training effective models from much less data is enabled by explicit solution warm starts. We then carry out ablation experiments training a roadmap of about 250 transformer models over 1-million tokens to determine ideal settings. We find that multiple different architectural variants produce highly-performant models, and discover from this ablation that some of the best are not the most parameterized. This appears to indicate well-generalized models could be reached using less data by using explicit solutions, and that architectural exploration using explicit solutions pays dividends in guiding the search for efficient variants with fewer parameters, and which could be incorporated into low-resource hardware where AI might be embodied.

    "abstract": "Text-based Person Search (TBPS) aims to retrieve images of target pedestrian indicated by textual descriptions. It is essential for TBPS to extract fine-grained local features and align them crossing modality. Existing methods utilize external tools or heavy cross-modal interaction to achieve explicit alignment of cross-modal fine-grained features, which is inefficient and time-consuming. In this work, we propose a Vision-Guided Semantic-Group Network (VGSG) for text-based person search to extract well-aligned fine-grained visual and textual features. In the proposed VGSG, we develop a Semantic-Group Textual Learning (SGTL) module and a Vision-guided Knowledge Transfer (VGKT) module to extract textual local features under the guidance of visual local clues. In SGTL, in order to obtain the local textual representation, we group textual features from the channel dimension based on the semantic cues of language expression, which encourages similar semantic patterns to be grouped implicitly without external tools. In VGKT, a vision-guided attention is employed to extract visual-related textual features, which are inherently aligned with visual cues and termed vision-guided textual features. Furthermore, we design a relational knowledge transfer, including a vision-language similarity transfer and a class probability transfer, to adaptively propagate information of the vision-guided textual features to semantic-group textual features. With the help of relational knowledge transfer, VGKT is capable of aligning semantic-group textual features with corresponding visual features without external tools and complex pairwise interaction. Experimental results on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Causality in distributed systems is a concept that has long been explored and numerous approaches have been made to use causality as a way to trace distributed system execution. Traditional approaches usually used system profiling and newer approaches profiled clocks of systems to detect failures and construct timelines that caused those failures. Since the advent of logical clocks, these profiles have become more and more accurate with ways to characterize concurrency and distributions, with accurate diagrams for message passing. Vector clocks addressed the shortcomings of using traditional logical clocks, by storing information about other processes in the system as well. Hybrid vector clocks are a novel approach to this concept where clocks need not store all the process information. Rather, we store information of processes within an acceptable skew of the focused process. This gives us an efficient way of profiling with substantially reduced costs to the system. Building on this idea, we propose the idea of building causal traces using information generated from the hybrid vector clock. The hybrid vector clock would provide us with a strong sense of concurrency and distribution, and we theorize that all the information generated from the clock is sufficient to develop a causal trace for debugging. We post-process and parse the clocks generated from an execution trace to develop a swimlane on a web interface, that traces the points of failure of a distributed system. We also provide an API to reuse this concept for any generic distributed system framework. ",

There is growing interest in how LMMs perform in more specialized domains. Social media content, inherently multimodal, blends text, images, videos, and sometimes audio. Understanding social multimedia content remains a challenging problem for contemporary machine learning frameworks. In this paper, we explore GPT-4V(ision)'s capabilities for social multimedia analysis. We select five representative tasks, including sentiment analysis, hate speech detection, fake news identification, demographic inference, and political ideology detection, to evaluate GPT-4V. Our investigation begins with a preliminary quantitative analysis for each task using existing benchmark datasets, followed by a careful review of the results and a selection of qualitative samples that illustrate GPT-4V's potential in understanding multimodal social media content. GPT-4V demonstrates remarkable efficacy in these tasks, showcasing strengths such as joint understanding of image-text pairs, contextual and cultural awareness, and extensive commonsense knowledge. Despite the overall impressive capacity of GPT-4V in the social media domain, there remain notable challenges. GPT-4V struggles with tasks involving multilingual social multimedia comprehension and has difficulties in generalizing to the latest trends in social media. Additionally, it exhibits a tendency to generate erroneous information in the context of evolving celebrity and politician knowledge, reflecting the known hallucination problem. The insights gleaned from our findings underscore a promising future for LMMs in enhancing our comprehension of social media content and its users through the analysis of multimodal information. ",

The goal of this work is to introduce an interpretable fine-tuning strategy for GNNs, with application to unstructured mesh-based fluid dynamics modeling. The end result is a fine-tuned GNN that adds interpretability to a pre-trained baseline GNN through an adaptive sub-graph sampling strategy that isolates regions in physical space intrinsically linked to the forecasting task, while retaining the predictive capability of the baseline. The structures identified by the fine-tuned GNNs, which are adaptively produced in the forward pass as explicit functions of the input, serve as an accessible link between the baseline model architecture, the optimization goal, and known problem-specific physics. Additionally, through a regularization procedure, the fine-tuned GNNs can also be used to identify, during inference, graph nodes that correspond to a majority of the anticipated forecasting error, adding a novel interpretable error-tagging capability to baseline models. Demonstrations are performed using unstructured flow data sourced from flow over a backward-facing step at high Reynolds numbers. ",

Alongside these developments, vulnerabilities associated with DNN training, such as backdoor attacks, are a significant concern.

Our research presents a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on tabular data using DNNs, particularly focusing on transformer-based networks. Given the inherent complexities of tabular data, we explore the challenges of embedding backdoors. Through systematic experimentation across benchmark datasets, we uncover that transformer-based DNNs for tabular data are highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, even with minimal feature value alterations. Our results indicate nearly perfect attack success rates (approx100%) by introducing novel backdoor attack strategies to tabular data. Furthermore, we evaluate several defenses against these attacks, identifying Spectral Signatures as the most effective one. Our findings highlight the urgency to address such vulnerabilities and provide insights into potential countermeasures for securing DNN models against backdoors on tabular data. ",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based pre-trained models of code (PTMC) have been widely utilized and have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many mission-critical applications. However, they can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks through identifier substitution or coding style transformation, which can significantly degrade accuracy and may further incur security concerns. Although several approaches have been proposed to generate adversarial examples for PTMC, the effectiveness and efficiency of such approaches, especially on different code intelligence tasks, has not been well understood. To bridge this gap, this study systematically analyzes five state-of-the-art adversarial attack approaches from three perspectives: effectiveness, efficiency, and the quality of generated examples. The results show that none of the five approaches balances all these perspectives. Particularly, approaches with a high attack success rate tend to be time-consuming; the adversarial code they generate often lack naturalness, and vice versa. To address this limitation, we explore the impact of perturbing identifiers under different contexts and find that identifier substitution within for and if statements is the most effective. Based on these findings, we propose a new approach that prioritizes different types of statements for various tasks and further utilizes beam search to generate adversarial examples. Evaluation results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art ALERT in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency while preserving the naturalness of the generated adversarial examples. ",

However, the existing literature shows that ICL encounters performance deterioration when exposed to adversarial inputs. Enhanced performance has been observed when ICL is augmented with natural language explanations (NLEs) (we refer to it as X-ICL). Thus, this work investigates whether X-ICL can improve the robustness of LLMs on a suite of seven adversarial and challenging natural language inference datasets. Moreover, we introduce a new approach to X-ICL by prompting an LLM (ChatGPT in our case) with few human-generated NLEs to produce further NLEs (we call it ChatGPT few-shot), which we show superior to both ChatGPT zero-shot and human-generated NLEs alone. We evaluate five popular LLMs (GPT3.5-turbo, LLaMa2, Vicuna, Zephyr, Mistral) and show that X-ICL with ChatGPT few-shot yields over 6% improvement over ICL. Furthermore, while prompt selection strategies were previously shown to significantly improve ICL on in-distribution test sets, we show that these strategies do not match the efficacy of the X-ICL paradigm in robustness-oriented evaluations.

In comparison to state-of-the-art machine learning weather forecast models, such as Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, our DLWP-HPX model uses coarser resolution and far fewer prognostic variables. Yet, at one-week lead times its skill is only about one day behind the state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. We report successive forecast improvements resulting from model design and data-related decisions, such as switching from the cubed sphere to the HEALPix mesh, inverting the channel depth of the U-Net, and introducing gated recurrent units (GRU) on each level of the U-Net hierarchy. The consistent east-west orientation of all cells on the HEALPix mesh facilitates the development of location-invariant convolution kernels that are successfully applied to propagate global weather patterns across our planet. Without any loss of spectral power after two days, the model can be unrolled autoregressively for hundreds of steps into the future to generate stable and realistic states of the atmosphere that respect seasonal trends, as showcased in one-year simulations. Our parsimonious DLWP-HPX model is research-friendly and potentially well-suited for sub-seasonal and seasonal forecasting. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has been employed to identify flow characteristics from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) databases to assist the researcher to better understand the flow field, to optimize the geometry design and to select the correct CFD configuration for corresponding flow characteristics. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most popular algorithms used to extract and identify flow features. However its use, without any additional flow field interpolation, is limited to the simple domain geometry and regular meshes which limits its application to real industrial cases where complex geometry and irregular meshes are usually used. Aiming at the aforementioned problems, we present a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based model with U-Net architecture to identify the vortex in CFD results on unstructured meshes. The graph generation and graph hierarchy construction using algebraic multigrid method from CFD meshes are introduced. A vortex auto-labeling method is proposed to label vortex regions in 2D CFD meshes. We precise our approach by firstly optimizing the input set on CNNs, then benchmarking current GNN kernels against CNN model and evaluating the performances of GNN kernels in terms of classification accuracy, training efficiency and identified vortex morphology. Finally, we demonstrate the adaptability of our approach to unstructured meshes and generality to unseen cases with different turbulence models at different Reynolds numbers. ",

    "abstract": "The field of Radiation Oncology is uniquely positioned to benefit from the use of artificial intelligence to fully automate the creation of radiation treatment plans for cancer therapy. This time-consuming and specialized task combines patient imaging with organ and tumor segmentation to generate a 3D radiation dose distribution to meet clinical treatment goals, similar to voxel-level dense prediction. In this work, we propose Swin UNETR++, that contains a lightweight 3D Dual Cross-Attention (DCA) module to capture the intra and inter-volume relationships of each patient's unique anatomy, which fully convolutional neural networks lack. Our model was trained, validated, and tested on the Open Knowledge-Based Planning dataset. In addition to metrics of Dose Score $\\overline{S_{\\text{Dose}}}$ and DVH Score $\\overline{S_{\\text{DVH}}}$ that quantitatively measure the difference between the predicted and ground-truth 3D radiation dose distribution, we propose the qualitative metrics of average volume-wise acceptance rate $\\overline{R_{\\text{VA}}}$ and average patient-wise clinical acceptance rate $\\overline{R_{\\text{PA}}}$ to assess the clinical reliability of the predictions. Swin UNETR++ demonstrates near-state-of-the-art performance on validation and test dataset (validation: $\\overline{S_{\\text{DVH}}}$=1.492 Gy, $\\overline{S_{\\text{Dose}}}$=2.649 Gy, $\\overline{R_{\\text{VA}}}$=88.58%, $\\overline{R_{\\text{PA}}}$=100.0%; test: $\\overline{S_{\\text{DVH}}}$=1.634 Gy, $\\overline{S_{\\text{Dose}}}$=2.757 Gy, $\\overline{R_{\\text{VA}}}$=90.50%, $\\overline{R_{\\text{PA}}}$=98.0%), establishing a basis for future studies to translate 3D dose predictions into a deliverable treatment plan, facilitating full automation.

In response to this challenge, current advancements are pivoting towards detecting osteoporosis by examining alternative indicators from peripheral bone areas, with the goal of increasing screening rates without added expenses or time. In this paper, we present a method to predict osteoporosis using hand and wrist X-ray images, which are both widely accessible and affordable, though their link to DXA-based data is not thoroughly explored. Initially, our method segments the ulnar, radius, and metacarpal bones using a foundational model for image segmentation. Then, we use a self-supervised learning approach to extract meaningful representations without the need for explicit labels, and move on to classify osteoporosis in a supervised manner. Our method is evaluated on a dataset with 192 individuals, cross-referencing their verified osteoporosis conditions against the standard DXA test. With a notable classification score (AUC=0.83), our model represents a pioneering effort in leveraging vision-based techniques for osteoporosis identification from the peripheral skeleton sites. ",

    "abstract": "Survival prediction plays a crucial role in assisting clinicians with the development of cancer treatment protocols. Recent evidence shows that multimodal data can help in the diagnosis of cancer disease and improve survival prediction. Currently, deep learning-based approaches have experienced increasing success in survival prediction by integrating pathological images and gene expression data. However, most existing approaches overlook the intra-modality latent information and the complex inter-modality correlations. Furthermore, existing modalities do not fully exploit the immense representational capabilities of neural networks for feature aggregation and disregard the importance of relationships between features. Therefore, it is highly recommended to address these issues in order to enhance the prediction performance by proposing a novel deep learning-based method. We propose a novel framework named Two-stream Transformer-based Multimodal Fusion Network for survival prediction (TTMFN), which integrates pathological images and gene expression data. In TTMFN, we present a two-stream multimodal co-attention transformer module to take full advantage of the complex relationships between different modalities and the potential connections within the modalities. Additionally, we develop a multi-head attention pooling approach to effectively aggregate the feature representations of the two modalities. The experiment results on four datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas demonstrate that TTMFN can achieve the best performance or competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art methods in predicting the overall survival of patients.

    "abstract": "The automatic identification and analysis of pronunciation errors, known as Mispronunciation Detection and Diagnosis (MDD) plays a crucial role in Computer Aided Pronunciation Learning (CAPL) tools such as Second-Language (L2) learning or speech therapy applications. Existing MDD methods relying on analysing phonemes can only detect categorical errors of phonemes that have an adequate amount of training data to be modelled. With the unpredictable nature of the pronunciation errors of non-native or disordered speakers and the scarcity of training datasets, it is unfeasible to model all types of mispronunciations. Moreover, phoneme-level MDD approaches have a limited ability to provide detailed diagnostic information about the error made. In this paper, we propose a low-level MDD approach based on the detection of speech attribute features. Speech attribute features break down phoneme production into elementary components that are directly related to the articulatory system leading to more formative feedback to the learner. We further propose a multi-label variant of the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) approach to jointly model the non-mutually exclusive speech attributes using a single model. The pre-trained wav2vec2 model was employed as a core model for the speech attribute detector. The proposed method was applied to L2 speech corpora collected from English learners from different native languages. The proposed speech attribute MDD method was further compared to the traditional phoneme-level MDD and achieved a significantly lower False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR), and Diagnostic Error Rate (DER) over all speech attributes compared to the phoneme-level equivalent.

    "abstract": "A simple procedure for the design of recursive digital filters with an infinite impulse response (IIR) and non-recursive digital filters with a finite impulse response (FIR) is described. The fixed-lag smoothing filters are designed to track an approximately polynomial signal of specified degree without bias at steady state, while minimizing the gain of high-frequency (coloured) noise with a specified power spectral density. For the IIR variant, the procedure determines the optimal lag (i.e. the passband group delay) yielding a recursive low-complexity smoother of low order, with a specified bandwidth, and excellent passband phase linearity. The filters are applied to the problem of instantaneous frequency estimation, e.g. for Doppler-shift measurement, for a complex exponential with polynomial phase progression in additive white noise. For this classical problem, simulations show that the incorporation of a prediction filter (with a one-sample lead) reduces the incidence of (phase or frequency) angle unwrapping errors, particularly for signals with high rates of angle change, which are known to limit the performance of standard FIR estimators at low SNR. This improvement allows the instantaneous phase of low-frequency signals to be estimated, e.g. for time-delay measurement, and/or the instantaneous frequency of frequency-modulated signals, down to a lower SNR. In the absence of unwrapping errors, the error variance of the IIR estimators (with the optimal phase lag) reaches the FIR lower bound, at a significantly lower computational cost. Guidelines for configuring and tuning both FIR and IIR filters are provided. ",

The generalization ability of the models is enhanced by employing numerous power spectra samples with different bandwidth parameters and a variety of material properties related to fatigue life.

GCMs are physics-based simulators which combine a numerical solver for large-scale dynamics with tuned representations for small-scale processes such as cloud formation. Recently, machine learning (ML) models trained on reanalysis data achieved comparable or better skill than GCMs for deterministic weather forecasting. However, these models have not demonstrated improved ensemble forecasts, or shown sufficient stability for long-term weather and climate simulations. Here we present the first GCM that combines a differentiable solver for atmospheric dynamics with ML components, and show that it can generate forecasts of deterministic weather, ensemble weather and climate on par with the best ML and physics-based methods. NeuralGCM is competitive with ML models for 1-10 day forecasts, and with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ensemble prediction for 1-15 day forecasts. With prescribed sea surface temperature, NeuralGCM can accurately track climate metrics such as global mean temperature for multiple decades, and climate forecasts with 140 km resolution exhibit emergent phenomena such as realistic frequency and trajectories of tropical cyclones. For both weather and climate, our approach offers orders of magnitude computational savings over conventional GCMs. Our results show that end-to-end deep learning is compatible with tasks performed by conventional GCMs, and can enhance the large-scale physical simulations that are essential for understanding and predicting the Earth system.

It is well established that, in general, such questions cannot be answered definitively from observational data, e.g., as a consequence of unobserved confounding. A generalization of this task is to determine non-trivial bounds on causal effects induced by the data, also known as the task of partial causal identification. In the literature, several algorithms have been developed for solving this problem. Most, however, require a known parametric form or a fully specified causal diagram as input, which is usually not available in practical applications. In this paper, we assume as input a less informative structure known as a Partial Ancestral Graph, which represents a Markov equivalence class of causal diagrams and is learnable from observational data. In this more \"data-driven\" setting, we provide a systematic algorithm to derive bounds on causal effects that can be computed analytically. ",

In this work, we develop the multidimensional electrical network by defining Kirchhoff's Alternative Law and Ohm's Alternative Law based on the novel multidimensional quantum walk framework by Jeffery and Zur [STOC '23]. This multidimensional electrical network allows us to sample from the electrical flow obtained via a multidimensional quantum walk algorithm and achieve exponential quantum-classical separations for certain graph problems. We first use this framework to find a marked vertex in one-dimensional random hierarchical graphs as defined by Balasubramanian, Li, and Harrow [arXiv '23]. In this work, they generalised the well known exponential quantum-classical separation of the welded tree problem by Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann, and Spielman [STOC '03] to random hierarchical graphs. Our result partially recovers their results with an arguably simpler analysis. Furthermore, by constructing a $3$-regular graph based on welded trees, this framework also allows us to show an exponential speedup for the pathfinding problem. This solves one of the open problems by Li [arXiv '23], where they construct a non-regular graph and use the degree information to achieve a similar speedup. In analogy to the connection between the (edge-vertex) incidence matrix of a graph and Kirchhoff's Law and Ohm's Law in an electrical network, we also rebuild the connection between the alternative incidence matrix and Kirchhoff's Alternative Law and Ohm's Alternative Law. By establishing this connection, we expect that the multidimensional electrical network could have more applications beyond quantum walks. ",

    "abstract": "Reliable evaluations of geotechnical hazards like landslides and debris flow require accurate simulation of granular flow dynamics. Traditional numerical methods can simulate the complex behaviors of such flows that involve solid-like to fluid-like transitions, but they are computationally intractable when simulating large-scale systems. Surrogate models based on statistical or machine learning methods are a viable alternative, but they are typically empirical and rely on a confined set of parameters in evaluating associated risks. Due to their permutation-dependent learning, conventional machine learning models require an unreasonably large amount of training data for building generalizable surrogate models. We employ a graph neural network (GNN), a novel deep learning technique, to develop a GNN-based simulator (GNS) for granular flows to address these issues. Graphs represent the state of granular flows and interactions, like the exchange of energy and momentum between grains, and GNN learns the local interaction law. GNS takes the current state of the granular flow and estimates the next state using Euler explicit integration. We train GNS on a limited set of granular flow trajectories and evaluate its performance in a three-dimensional granular column collapse domain. GNS successfully reproduces the overall behaviors of column collapses with various aspect ratios that were not encountered during training. The computation speed of GNS outperforms high-fidelity numerical simulators by 300 times. ",

The patterns learned are often used in transportation research areas such as eco-driving, road safety, and intelligent vehicles. One such model capable of modeling these patterns is the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HDP-HSMM), as it is often used to estimate data segmentation, state duration, and transition probabilities. While this model is a powerful tool for automatically clustering observed sequential data, the existing HDP-HSMM estimation suffers from an inherent tendency to overestimate the number of states. This can result in poor estimation, which can potentially impact impact transportation research through incorrect inference of driving patterns. In this paper, a new robust HDP-HSMM (rHDP-HSMM) method is proposed to reduce the number of redundant states and improve the consistency of the model's estimation. Both a simulation study and a case study using naturalistic driving data are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed rHDP-HSMM in identifying and inference of driving maneuver patterns.
