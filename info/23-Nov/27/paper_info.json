    "abstract": "There is nowadays a growing demand in vehicular communications for real-time applications requiring video assistance. The new state-of-the-art high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard is very promising for real-time video streaming. It offers high coding efficiency, as well as dedicated low delay coding structures. Among these, the all intra (AI) coding structure guarantees minimal coding time at the expense of higher video bitrates, which therefore penalizes transmission performances. In this work, we propose an original cross-layer system in order to enhance received video quality in vehicular communications. The system is low complex and relies on a multiple description coding (MDC) approach. It is based on an adaptive mapping mechanism applied at the IEEE 802.11p standard medium access control (MAC) layer. Simulation results in a realistic vehicular environment demonstrate that for low delay video communications, the proposed method provides significant video quality improvements on the receiver side.

This approach poses a substantial threat to the privacy of individuals and organizations alike. This research presents a comprehensive analysis of the gradient leakage method when applied specifically to transformer-based models. Through meticulous examination, we showcase the capability to accurately recover data solely from gradients and rigorously investigate the conditions under which gradient attacks can be executed, providing compelling evidence. Furthermore, we reevaluate the approach of introducing additional noise on gradients as a protective measure against gradient attacks. To address this, we outline a theoretical proof that analyzes the associated privacy costs within the framework of differential privacy. Additionally, we affirm the convergence of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm under perturbed gradients. The primary objective of this study is to augment the understanding of gradient leakage attack and defense strategies while actively contributing to the development of privacy-preserving techniques specifically tailored for transformer-based models. By shedding light on the vulnerabilities and countermeasures associated with gradient leakage, this research aims to foster advancements in safeguarding sensitive data and upholding privacy in the context of transformer-based models.

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in capturing complex 3D scenes with high fidelity. However, one persistent challenge that hinders the widespread adoption of NeRFs is the computational bottleneck due to the volumetric rendering. On the other hand, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an alternative representation that leverages a 3D Gaussisan-based representation and adopts the rasterization pipeline to render the images rather than volumetric rendering, achieving very fast rendering speed and promising image quality. However, a significant drawback arises as 3DGS entails a substantial number of 3D Gaussians to maintain the high fidelity of the rendered images, which requires a large amount of memory and storage. To address this critical issue, we place a specific emphasis on two key objectives: reducing the number of Gaussian points without sacrificing performance and compressing the Gaussian attributes, such as view-dependent color and covariance. To this end, we propose a learnable mask strategy that significantly reduces the number of Gaussians while preserving high performance. In addition, we propose a compact but effective representation of view-dependent color by employing a grid-based neural field rather than relying on spherical harmonics. Finally, we learn codebooks to compactly represent the geometric attributes of Gaussian by vector quantization. In our extensive experiments, we consistently show over 10$\\times$ reduced storage and enhanced rendering speed, while maintaining the quality of the scene representation, compared to 3DGS. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for 3D scene representation, achieving high performance, fast training, compactness, and real-time rendering.

In order to fill this gap, we propose DiverseNet architectures which explore multi-head and multi-model semi-supervised learning algorithms by simultaneously promoting precision and diversity during training. The two proposed methods of DiverseNet, namely the DiverseHead and DiverseModel, achieve the highest semantic segmentation performance in four widely utilised remote sensing imagery data sets compared to state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods.

However, recent research has demonstrated that FL protocols can be easily compromised by active reconstruction attacks executed by dishonest servers. These attacks involve the malicious modification of global model parameters, allowing the server to obtain a verbatim copy of users' private data by inverting their gradient updates. Tackling this class of attack remains a crucial challenge due to the strong threat model. In this paper, we propose OASIS, a defense mechanism based on image augmentation that effectively counteracts active reconstruction attacks while preserving model performance. We first uncover the core principle of gradient inversion that enables these attacks and theoretically identify the main conditions by which the defense can be robust regardless of the attack strategies. We then construct OASIS with image augmentation showing that it can undermine the attack principle. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of OASIS highlighting its feasibility as a solution. ",

These models have expanded the abilities of artificial intelligence by offering great solutions to complex problems that were very difficult to solve earlier. In spite of their unseen success in various, it has been identified, through research conducted, that deep learning models can be subjected to various attacks that compromise model security and data privacy of the Deep Neural Network models. Deep learning models can be subjected to various attacks at different stages of their lifecycle. During the testing phase, attackers can exploit vulnerabilities through different kinds of attacks such as Model Extraction Attacks, Model Inversion attacks, and Adversarial attacks. Model Extraction Attacks are aimed at reverse-engineering a trained deep learning model, with the primary objective of revealing its architecture and parameters. Model inversion attacks aim to compromise the privacy of the data used in the Deep learning model. These attacks are done to compromise the confidentiality of the model by going through the sensitive training data from the model's predictions. By analyzing the model's responses, attackers aim to reconstruct sensitive information. In this way, the model's data privacy is compromised. Adversarial attacks, mainly employed on computer vision models, are made to corrupt models into confidently making incorrect predictions through malicious testing data. These attacks subtly alter the input data, making it look normal but misleading deep learning models to make incorrect decisions. Such attacks can happen during both the model's evaluation and training phases. Data Poisoning Attacks add harmful data to the training set, disrupting the learning process and reducing the reliability of the deep learning mode. ",

Then, original multi-modal signals serve as reconstruction targets for the rendered multi-modal feature maps to enable self-supervised representation learning. Extensive experiments show that the representation learned via NS-MAE shows promising transferability for diverse multi-modal and single-modal (camera-only and Lidar-only) perception models on diverse 3D perception downstream tasks (3D object detection and BEV map segmentation) with diverse amounts of fine-tuning labeled data. Moreover, we empirically find that NS-MAE enjoys the synergy of both the mechanism of masked autoencoder and neural radiance field. Our code shall be released upon acceptance. ",

Traditional fair spectral clustering (FSC) methods consist of two consecutive stages, i.e., performing fair spectral embedding on a given graph and conducting $k$means to obtain discrete cluster labels. However, in practice, the graph is usually unknown, and we need to construct the underlying graph from potentially noisy data, the quality of which inevitably affects subsequent fair clustering performance. Furthermore, performing FSC through separate steps breaks the connections among these steps, leading to suboptimal results. To this end, we first theoretically analyze the effect of the constructed graph on FSC. Motivated by the analysis, we propose a novel graph construction method with a node-adaptive graph filter to learn graphs from noisy data. Then, all independent stages of conventional FSC are integrated into a single objective function, forming an end-to-end framework that inputs raw data and outputs discrete cluster labels. An algorithm is developed to jointly and alternately update the variables in each stage. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on synthetic, benchmark, and real data, which show that our model is superior to state-of-the-art fair clustering methods. ",

This function class generalizes the single-index model, which corresponds to $k=1$, and is a natural class of functions possessing an underlying hierarchical structure. Our main result shows that for a large subclass of degree $k$ polynomials $p$, a three-layer neural network trained via layerwise gradient descent on the square loss learns the target $h$ up to vanishing test error in $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^k)$ samples and polynomial time. This is a strict improvement over kernel methods, which require $\\widetilde \\Theta(d^{kq})$ samples, as well as existing guarantees for two-layer networks, which require the target function to be low-rank.

    "abstract": "The presence of adversarial examples poses a significant threat to deep learning models and their applications. Existing defense methods provide certain resilience against adversarial examples, but often suffer from decreased accuracy and generalization performance, making it challenging to achieve a trade-off between robustness and generalization. To address this, our paper interprets the adversarial example problem from the perspective of sample distribution and proposes a defense method based on distribution shift, leveraging the distribution transfer capability of a diffusion model for adversarial defense. The core idea is to exploit the discrepancy between normal and adversarial sample distributions to achieve adversarial defense using a pretrained diffusion model. Specifically, an adversarial sample undergoes a forward diffusion process, moving away from the source distribution, followed by a reverse process guided by the protected model (victim model) output to map it back to the normal distribution. Experimental evaluations on CIFAR10 and ImageNet30 datasets are conducted, comparing with adversarial training and input preprocessing methods. For infinite-norm attacks with 8/255 perturbation, accuracy rates of 78.1% and 83.5% are achieved, respectively. For 2-norm attacks with 128/255 perturbation, accuracy rates are 74.3% and 82.5%. Additional experiments considering perturbation amplitude, diffusion iterations, and adaptive attacks also validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Results demonstrate that even when the attacker has knowledge of the defense, the proposed distribution-based method effectively withstands adversarial examples. It fills the gaps of traditional approaches, restoring high-quality original samples and showcasing superior performance in model robustness and generalization. ",

We argue that for the task of variable selection in the branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithm, incorporating the temporal information as well as the bipartite graph attention improves the solver's performance. We support our claims with intuitions and numerical results over several standard datasets used in the literature and competitions.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we highlight that both conformity and risk preference matter in making fund investment decisions beyond personal interest and seek to jointly characterize these aspects in a disentangled manner. Consequently, we develop a novel M ulti-granularity Graph Disentangled Learning framework named MGDL to effectively perform intelligent matching of fund investment products. Benefiting from the well-established fund graph and the attention module, multi-granularity user representations are derived from historical behaviors to separately express personal interest, conformity and risk preference in a fine-grained way. To attain stronger disentangled representations with specific semantics, MGDL explicitly involve two self-supervised signals, i.e., fund type based contrasts and fund popularity. Extensive experiments in offline and online environments verify the effectiveness of MGDL. ",

Our version of the algorithm uses a collection of generative models, in particular restricted Boltzmann machines, each of which represents the distribution of sliding window correlations between a pair of correlated measurements. We use such models in a residual generation scheme, where high residuals generate conflict sets that are then used in a subsequent diagnosis step. As a proof of concept, the framework is evaluated on a mobile logistics robot for the problem of recognising disconnected wheels, such that the evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the framework (on the faulty data set, the models obtained 88.6% precision and 75.6% recall rates), but also shows that the monitoring results are influenced by the choice of distribution model and the model parameters as a whole.

    "abstract": "Self-training techniques have shown remarkable value across many deep learning models and tasks. However, such techniques remain largely unexplored when considered in the context of learning fast solvers for systems of partial differential equations (Eg: Neural Operators). In this work, we explore the use of self-training for Fourier Neural Operators (FNO). Neural Operators emerged as a data driven technique, however, data from experiments or traditional solvers is not always readily available. Physics Informed Neural Operators (PINO) overcome this constraint by utilizing a physics loss for the training, however the accuracy of PINO trained without data does not match the performance obtained by training with data. In this work we show that self-training can be used to close this gap in performance. We examine canonical examples, namely the 1D-Burgers and 2D-Darcy PDEs, to showcase the efficacy of self-training. Specifically, FNOs, when trained exclusively with physics loss through self-training, approach 1.07x for Burgers and 1.02x for Darcy, compared to FNOs trained with both data and physics loss. Furthermore, we discover that pseudo-labels can be used for self-training without necessarily training to convergence in each iteration. A consequence of this is that we are able to discover self-training schedules that improve upon the baseline performance of PINO in terms of accuracy as well as time. ",

    "abstract": "With increasing urbanization, transportation plays an increasingly critical role in city development. The number of studies on modeling, optimization, simulation, and data analysis of transportation systems is on the rise. Many of these studies utilize transportation test networks to represent real-world transportation systems in urban areas, examining the efficacy of their proposed approaches. Each of these networks exhibits unique characteristics in their topology, making their applications distinct for various study objectives. Despite their widespread use in research, there is a lack of comprehensive study addressing the classification of these networks based on their topological characteristics. This study aims to fill this gap by employing unsupervised learning methods, particularly clustering. We present a comprehensive framework for evaluating various topological network characteristics. Additionally, we employ two dimensionality reduction techniques, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Isometric Feature Mapping (ISOMAP), to reduce overlaps of highly correlated features and enhance the interpretability of the subsequent classification results. We then utilize two clustering algorithms, K-means and HDBSCAN, to classify 14 transportation networks. The PCA method, followed by the K-means clustering approach, outperforms other alternatives with a Silhouette score of $0.510$, enabling the classification of transportation networks into five clusters. We also provide a detailed discussion on the resulting classification. ",

    "abstract": "Agnostic domain shift is the main reason of model degradation on the unknown target domains, which brings an urgent need to develop Domain Generalization (DG). Recent advances at DG use dynamic networks to achieve training-free adaptation on the unknown target domains, termed Dynamic Domain Generalization (DDG), which compensates for the lack of self-adaptability in static models with fixed weights. The parameters of dynamic networks can be decoupled into a static and a dynamic component, which are designed to learn domain-invariant and domain-specific features, respectively. Based on the existing arts, in this work, we try to push the limits of DDG by disentangling the static and dynamic components more thoroughly from an optimization perspective. Our main consideration is that we can enable the static component to learn domain-invariant features more comprehensively by augmenting the domain-specific information. As a result, the more comprehensive domain-invariant features learned by the static component can then enforce the dynamic component to focus more on learning adaptive domain-specific features. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective Parameter Exchange (PE) method to perturb the combination between the static and dynamic components. We optimize the model using the gradients from both the perturbed and non-perturbed feed-forward jointly to implicitly achieve the aforementioned disentanglement. In this way, the two components can be optimized in a mutually-beneficial manner, which can resist the agnostic domain shifts and improve the self-adaptability on the unknown target domain. Extensive experiments show that PE can be easily plugged into existing dynamic networks to improve their generalization ability without bells and whistles. ",

    "abstract": "Predicting individual aesthetic preferences holds significant practical applications and academic implications for human society. However, existing studies mainly focus on learning and predicting the commonality of facial attractiveness, with little attention given to Personalized Facial Beauty Prediction (PFBP). PFBP aims to develop a machine that can adapt to individual aesthetic preferences with only a few images rated by each user. In this paper, we formulate this task from a meta-learning perspective that each user corresponds to a meta-task. To address such PFBP task, we draw inspiration from the human aesthetic mechanism that visual aesthetics in society follows a Gaussian distribution, which motivates us to disentangle user preferences into a commonality and an individuality part. To this end, we propose a novel MetaFBP framework, in which we devise a universal feature extractor to capture the aesthetic commonality and then optimize to adapt the aesthetic individuality by shifting the decision boundary of the predictor via a meta-learning mechanism. Unlike conventional meta-learning methods that may struggle with slow adaptation or overfitting to tiny support sets, we propose a novel approach that optimizes a high-order predictor for fast adaptation. In order to validate the performance of the proposed method, we build several PFBP benchmarks by using existing facial beauty prediction datasets rated by numerous users. Extensive experiments on these benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MetaFBP method. ",

    "abstract": "Source-free object detection (SFOD) aims to adapt the source detector to unlabeled target domain data in the absence of source domain data. Most SFOD methods follow the same self-training paradigm using mean-teacher (MT) framework where the student model is guided by only one single teacher model. However, such paradigm can easily fall into a training instability problem that when the teacher model collapses uncontrollably due to the domain shift, the student model also suffers drastic performance degradation. To address this issue, we propose the Periodically Exchange Teacher-Student (PETS) method, a simple yet novel approach that introduces a multiple-teacher framework consisting of a static teacher, a dynamic teacher, and a student model. During the training phase, we periodically exchange the weights between the static teacher and the student model. Then, we update the dynamic teacher using the moving average of the student model that has already been exchanged by the static teacher. In this way, the dynamic teacher can integrate knowledge from past periods, effectively reducing error accumulation and enabling a more stable training process within the MT-based framework. Further, we develop a consensus mechanism to merge the predictions of two teacher models to provide higher-quality pseudo labels for student model. Extensive experiments on multiple SFOD benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other related methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method on SFOD task.

    "abstract": "The improvement in the performance of efficient and lightweight models (i.e., the student model) is achieved through knowledge distillation (KD), which involves transferring knowledge from more complex models (i.e., the teacher model). However, most existing KD techniques rely on Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which has certain limitations. First, if the teacher distribution has high entropy, the KL divergence's mode-averaging nature hinders the transfer of sufficient target information. Second, when the teacher distribution has low entropy, the KL divergence tends to excessively focus on specific modes, which fails to convey an abundant amount of valuable knowledge to the student. Consequently, when dealing with datasets that contain numerous confounding or challenging samples, student models may struggle to acquire sufficient knowledge, resulting in subpar performance. Furthermore, in previous KD approaches, we observed that data augmentation, a technique aimed at enhancing a model's generalization, can have an adverse impact. Therefore, we propose a Robustness-Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (R2KD) that leverages correlation distance and network pruning. This approach enables KD to effectively incorporate data augmentation for performance improvement. Extensive experiments on various datasets, including CIFAR-100, FGVR, TinyImagenet, and ImageNet, demonstrate our method's superiority over current state-of-the-art methods. ",

Due to temporal boundary annotations of the video are extremely time-consuming to acquire, modeling in the weakly-supervised setting is increasingly focused, where we only have access to the video-sentence pairs during training. Most existing weakly-supervised methods adopt a MIL-based framework to develop inter-sample confrontment, but neglect the intra-sample confrontment between moments with similar semantics. Therefore, these methods fail to distinguish the correct moment from plausible negative moments. Further, the previous attention models in cross-modal interaction tend to focus on a few dominant words exorbitantly, ignoring the comprehensive video-sentence correspondence. In this paper, we propose a novel Regularized Two-Branch Proposal Network with Erasing Mechanism to consider the inter-sample and intra-sample confrontments simultaneously. Concretely, we first devise a language-aware visual filter to generate both enhanced and suppressed video streams. Then, we design the sharable two-branch proposal module to generate positive and plausible negative proposals from the enhanced and suppressed branch respectively, contributing to sufficient confrontment. Besides, we introduce an attention-guided dynamic erasing mechanism in enhanced branch to discover the complementary video-sentence relation. Moreover, we apply two types of proposal regularization to stabilize the training process and improve model performance. The extensive experiments on ActivityCaption, Charades-STA and DiDeMo datasets show the effectiveness of our method. ",

In this paper, we observe that the singular value distributions of the in-distribution (ID) and OOD features are quite different: the OOD feature matrix tends to have a larger dominant singular value than the ID feature, and the class predictions of OOD samples are largely determined by it. This observation motivates us to propose \\texttt{RankFeat}, a simple yet effective \\emph{post hoc} approach for OOD detection by removing the rank-1 matrix composed of the largest singular value and the associated singular vectors from the high-level feature. \\texttt{RankFeat} achieves \\emph{state-of-the-art} performance and reduces the average false positive rate (FPR95) by 17.90\\% compared with the previous best method. The success of \\texttt{RankFeat} motivates us to investigate whether a similar phenomenon would exist in the parameter matrices of neural networks. We thus propose \\texttt{RankWeight} which removes the rank-1 weight from the parameter matrices of a single deep layer. Our \\texttt{RankWeight}is also \\emph{post hoc} and only requires computing the rank-1 matrix once. As a standalone approach, \\texttt{RankWeight} has very competitive performance against other methods across various backbones. Moreover, \\texttt{RankWeight} enjoys flexible compatibility with a wide range of OOD detection methods. The combination of \\texttt{RankWeight} and \\texttt{RankFeat} refreshes the new \\emph{state-of-the-art} performance, achieving the FPR95 as low as 16.13\\% on the ImageNet-1k benchmark.

Further, it was conjectured that the crown graphs have the highest representation number among the bipartite graphs. In this work, first, we reconcile the relation between the prn of a comparability graph and the dimension of its induced poset and review the upper bounds on the prn of bipartite graphs. Then, we study the prn of bipartite graphs using the notion called neighborhood graphs. This approach substantiates the aforesaid conjecture and gives us theoretical evidence. In this connection, we devise a polynomial-time procedure to construct a word that represents a given bipartite graph permutationally. Accordingly, we provide a better upper bound for the prn of bipartite graphs.

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are capable of answering knowledge-intensive complex questions with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they tend to generate factually incorrect reasoning steps when the required knowledge is not available or up-to-date in models' parameters. Recent works turn to retrieving external knowledge to augment CoT reasoning. Despite being promising, these chain-based methods suffer from: 1) Negative retrieval. Unnecessary or incorrect retrieval may mislead the reasoning; 2) Limited sight. Lacking the ability to look backward or forward, a local error in one step will propagate along the chain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach: Probabilistic Tree-of-thought Reasoning (ProbTree). First, LLMs translate a complex question into a query tree, in which each non-root node denotes a sub-question of its parent node. Then, probabilistic reasoning is conducted over the tree, by solving questions from leaf to root considering the confidence of both question decomposing and answering. During reasoning, for leaf nodes, LLMs choose a more confident answer from Closed-book QA that employs parametric knowledge and Open-book QA that employs retrieved external knowledge, thus eliminating the negative retrieval problem. For non-leaf nodes, with the hierarchical structure, LLMs have broader sights and are able to globally reason with the information from child nodes, thus recovering from local errors. The experiments on three Complex QA datasets under the open-domain setting show that our approach outperforms SOTA methods significantly, demonstrating the effect of probabilistic tree-of-thought reasoning.

    "abstract": "Optimization problems find widespread use in both single-objective and multi-objective scenarios. In practical applications, users aspire for solutions that converge to the region of interest (ROI) along the Pareto front (PF). While the conventional approach involves approximating a fitness function or an objective function to reflect user preferences, this paper explores an alternative avenue. Specifically, we aim to discover a method that sidesteps the need for calculating the fitness function, relying solely on human feedback. Our proposed approach entails conducting direct preference learning facilitated by an active dueling bandit algorithm. The experimental phase is structured into three sessions. Firstly, we assess the performance of our active dueling bandit algorithm. Secondly, we implement our proposed method within the context of Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). Finally, we deploy our method in a practical problem, specifically in protein structure prediction (PSP). This research presents a novel interactive preference-based MOEA framework that not only addresses the limitations of traditional techniques but also unveils new possibilities for optimization problems.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence, and specifically deep neural networks (DNNs), has rapidly emerged in the past decade as the standard for several tasks from specific advertising to object detection. The performance offered has led DNN algorithms to become a part of critical embedded systems, requiring both efficiency and reliability. In particular, DNNs are subject to malicious examples designed in a way to fool the network while being undetectable to the human observer: the adversarial examples. While previous studies propose frameworks to implement such attacks in black box settings, those often rely on the hypothesis that the attacker has access to the logits of the neural network, breaking the assumption of the traditional black box. In this paper, we investigate a real black box scenario where the attacker has no access to the logits. In particular, we propose an architecture-agnostic attack which solve this constraint by extracting the logits. Our method combines hardware and software attacks, by performing a side-channel attack that exploits electromagnetic leakages to extract the logits for a given input, allowing an attacker to estimate the gradients and produce state-of-the-art adversarial examples to fool the targeted neural network. Through this example of adversarial attack, we demonstrate the effectiveness of logits extraction using side-channel as a first step for more general attack frameworks requiring either the logits or the confidence scores.

    "abstract": "Despite significant recent advances in similarity detection tasks, existing approaches pose substantial challenges under memory constraints. One of the primary reasons for this is the use of computationally expensive metric learning loss functions such as Triplet Loss in Siamese networks. In this paper, we present a novel loss function called Shadow Loss that compresses the dimensions of an embedding space during loss calculation without loss of performance. The distance between the projections of the embeddings is learned from inputs on a compact projection space where distances directly correspond to a measure of class similarity. Projecting on a lower-dimension projection space, our loss function converges faster, and the resulting classified image clusters have higher inter-class and smaller intra-class distances. Shadow Loss not only reduces embedding dimensions favoring memory constraint devices but also consistently performs better than the state-of-the-art Triplet Margin Loss by an accuracy of 5\\%-10\\% across diverse datasets. The proposed loss function is also model agnostic, upholding its performance across several tested models. Its effectiveness and robustness across balanced, imbalanced, medical, and non-medical image datasets suggests that it is not specific to a particular model or dataset but demonstrates superior performance consistently while using less memory and computation.

In cloud-based paradigms, users are forced to compromise data locality for generation quality and processing speed. Conversely, edge device paradigms maintain data locality but fail to deliver satisfactory performance. In this work, we propose a novel LLM service paradigm that distributes privacy-sensitive computation on edge devices and shared computation in the cloud. Only activations are transmitted between the central cloud and edge devices to ensure data locality. Our core innovation, PrivateLoRA, addresses the challenging communication overhead by exploiting the low rank of residual activations, achieving over 95% communication reduction. Consequently, PrivateLoRA effectively maintains data locality and is extremely resource efficient. Under standard 5G networks, PrivateLoRA achieves throughput over 300% of device-only solutions for 7B models and over 80% of an A100 GPU for 33B models. PrivateLoRA also provides tuning performance comparable to LoRA for advanced personalization. Our approach democratizes access to state-of-the-art generative AI for edge devices, paving the way for more tailored LLM experiences for the general public.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative learning of large-scale distributed clients without data sharing. However, due to the disparity of computing resources among massive mobile computing devices, the performance of traditional homogeneous model-based Federated Learning (FL) is seriously limited. On the one hand, to achieve model training in all the diverse clients, mobile computing systems can only use small low-performance models for collaborative learning. On the other hand, devices with high computing resources cannot train a high-performance large model with their insufficient raw data. To address the resource-constrained problem in mobile computing systems, we present a novel heterogeneous FL approach named AdapterFL, which uses a model reassemble strategy to facilitate collaborative training of massive heterogeneous mobile devices adaptively. Specifically, we select multiple candidate heterogeneous models based on the computing performance of massive mobile devices and then divide each heterogeneous model into two partitions. By reassembling the partitions, we can generate models with varied sizes that are combined by the partial parameters of the large model with the partial parameters of the small model. Using these reassembled models for FL training, we can train the partial parameters of the large model using low-performance devices. In this way, we can alleviate performance degradation in large models due to resource constraints. The experimental results show that AdapterFL can achieve up to 12\\% accuracy improvement compared to the state-of-the-art heterogeneous federated learning methods in resource-constrained scenarios.

In this work, first, the governing equations are discretized using a finite difference scheme (whereas, any other discretization technique can be adopted), then projected on a reduced or latent space using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)-Galerkin approach and next, the residual arising from discretized reduced order equation is considered as an additional loss penalty term alongside the data-driven loss term using different variants of deep learning method such as Artificial neural network (ANN), Long Short-Term Memory based neural network (LSTM). The LSTM neural network has been proven to be very effective for time-dependent problems in a purely data-driven environment. The current work demonstrates the LSTM network's potential over ANN networks in physics-informed neural networks (PINN) as well. The potential of using discretized governing equations instead of continuous form lies in the flexibility of input to the PINN. Different sizes of data ranging from small, medium to big datasets are used to assess the potential of discretized-physics-informed neural networks when there is very sparse or no data available. The proposed methods are applied to a pitch-plunge airfoil motion governed by rigid-body dynamics and a one-dimensional viscous Burgers' equation. The current work also demonstrates the prediction capability of various discretized-physics-informed neural networks outside the domain where the data is available or governing equation-based residuals are minimized.

The present investigation proposes a new approach to identify a set of nondominated neural network models for further selection by the decision maker. A new coevolution approach is proposed to simultaneously select the features and topology of neural networks (collectively referred to as neural architecture), where the features are viewed from a topological perspective as input neurons. Further, the coevolution is posed as a multicriteria problem to evolve sparse and efficacious neural architectures. The well known dominance and decomposition based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms are augmented with a nongeometric crossover operator to diversify and balance the search for neural architectures across conflicting criteria. Moreover, the coevolution is augmented to accommodate the data based implications of distinct market behaviors prior to and during the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic. A detailed comparative evaluation is carried out with the conventional sequential approach of feature selection followed by neural topology design, as well as a scalarized coevolution approach. The results on the NASDAQ index in pre and peri COVID time windows convincingly demonstrate that the proposed coevolution approach can evolve a set of nondominated neural forecasting models with better generalization capabilities.

To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework (HGCLIP) that effectively combines CLIP with a deeper exploitation of the Hierarchical class structure via Graph representation learning. We explore constructing the class hierarchy into a graph, with its nodes representing the textual or image features of each category. After passing through a graph encoder, the textual features incorporate hierarchical structure information, while the image features emphasize class-aware features derived from prototypes through the attention mechanism.

An agent, who does not know the joint information structure between signals and states, sees the experts' recommendations and aims to match the action with the true state. Under the scenario, we study whether supplemented additionally with second-order information (each expert's forecast on the other's recommendation) could enable a better aggregation. We adopt a minimax regret framework to evaluate the aggregator's performance, by comparing it to an omniscient benchmark that knows the joint information structure. With general information structures, we show that second-order information provides no benefit. No aggregator can improve over a trivial aggregator, which always follows the first expert's recommendation. However, positive results emerge when we assume experts' signals are conditionally independent given the world state. When the aggregator is deterministic, we present a robust aggregator that leverages second-order information, which can significantly outperform counterparts without it. Second, when two experts are homogeneous, by adding a non-degenerate assumption on the signals, we demonstrate that random aggregators using second-order information can surpass optimal ones without it. In the remaining settings, the second-order information is not beneficial. We also extend the above results to the setting when the aggregator's utility function is more general. ",

It is a current open study subject because of its intricacy and utility. The identification of aberrant events automatically, it's a difficult undertaking because everyone's idea of abnormality is different. A typical occurrence in one circumstance could be seen as aberrant in another. Automatic anomaly identification becomes particularly challenging in the surveillance footage with a large crowd due to congestion and high occlusion. With the use of machine learning techniques, this thesis study aims to offer the solution for this use case so that human resources won't be required to keep an eye out for any unusual activity in the surveillance system records. We have developed a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) based anomaly detection model. This model is trained such that it learns together about constructing a high dimensional picture space and determining the latent space from the video's context. The generator uses a residual Autoencoder architecture made up of a multi-stage channel attention-based decoder and a two-stream, deep convolutional encoder that can realise both spatial and temporal data. We have also offered a technique for refining the GAN model that reduces training time while also generalising the model by utilising transfer learning between datasets. Using a variety of assessment measures, we compare our model to the current state-of-the-art techniques on four benchmark datasets. The empirical findings indicate that, in comparison to existing techniques, our network performs favourably on all datasets. ",

Consistency training addresses this issue with single-step sampling but often produces lower-quality generations and requires high training costs. In this paper, we show that optimizing consistency training loss minimizes the Wasserstein distance between target and generated distributions. As timestep increases, the upper bound accumulates previous consistency training losses. Therefore, larger batch sizes are needed to reduce both current and accumulated losses. We propose Adversarial Consistency Training (ACT), which directly minimizes the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence between distributions at each timestep using a discriminator. Theoretically, ACT enhances generation quality, and convergence. By incorporating a discriminator into the consistency training framework, our method achieves improved FID scores on CIFAR10 and ImageNet 64$\\times$64, retains zero-shot image inpainting capabilities, and uses less than $1/6$ of the original batch size and fewer than $1/2$ of the model parameters and training steps compared to the baseline method, this leads to a substantial reduction in resource consumption.

In this work, we further showed that neural networks, wherein individual parameters or activations can take on different precisions ranging between 1 and 4 bits, can achieve accuracies comparable to or exceeding the full-precision counterparts. However, the deployment of such networks poses numerous challenges, stemming from the necessity to manage and control the compute/communication/storage requirements associated with these extremely fine-grained mixed precisions for each piece of data. There is a lack of existing efficient hardware and system-level support tailored to these unique and challenging requirements. Our research introduces the first novel holistic hardware-software co-design approach for these networks, which enables a continuous feedback loop between hardware design, training, and inference to facilitate systematic design exploration. As a proof-of-concept, we illustrate this co-design approach by designing new, configurable CPU SIMD architectures tailored for these networks, tightly integrating the architecture with new system-aware training and inference techniques. We perform systematic design space exploration using this framework to analyze various tradeoffs. The design for mixed-precision networks that achieves optimized tradeoffs corresponds to an architecture that supports 1, 2, and 4-bit fixed-point operations with four configurable precision patterns, when coupled with system-aware training and inference optimization -- networks trained for this design achieve accuracies that closely match full-precision accuracies, while compressing and improving run-time efficiency of the neural networks drastically by 10-20x, compared to full-precision networks.

In the case of a single-layer network in the weakly oversampled regime, the spectrum of the noise covariance matrix deviates notably from the Hessian, which can be attributed to the broken detailed balance of SGD dynamics. The weight fluctuations are in this case generally anisotropic, but experience an isotropic loss. For a two-layer network, we obtain the stochastic dynamics of the weights in each layer and analyze the associated stationary covariances. We identify the inter-layer coupling as a new source of anisotropy for the weight fluctuations. In contrast to the single-layer case, the weight fluctuations experience an anisotropic loss, the flatness of which is inversely related to the fluctuation variance.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLM) have made significant advances in the recent past becoming more mainstream in Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled human-facing applications. However, LLMs often generate stereotypical output inherited from historical data, amplifying societal biases and raising ethical concerns. This work introduces i) the Multi-Grain Stereotype Dataset, which includes 52,751 instances of gender, race, profession and religion stereotypic text and ii) a novel stereotype classifier for English text. We design several experiments to rigorously test the proposed model trained on the novel dataset. Our experiments show that training the model in a multi-class setting can outperform the one-vs-all binary counterpart. Consistent feature importance signals from different eXplainable AI tools demonstrate that the new model exploits relevant text features. We utilise the newly created model to assess the stereotypic behaviour of the popular GPT family of models and observe the reduction of bias over time. In summary, our work establishes a robust and practical framework for auditing and evaluating the stereotypic bias in LLM. ",

    "abstract": "Distributed learning has emerged as a leading paradigm for training large machine learning models. However, in real-world scenarios, participants may be unreliable or malicious, posing a significant challenge to the integrity and accuracy of the trained models. Byzantine fault tolerance mechanisms have been proposed to address these issues, but they often assume full participation from all clients, which is not always practical due to the unavailability of some clients or communication constraints. In our work, we propose the first distributed method with client sampling and provable tolerance to Byzantine workers. The key idea behind the developed method is the use of gradient clipping to control stochastic gradient differences in recursive variance reduction. This allows us to bound the potential harm caused by Byzantine workers, even during iterations when all sampled clients are Byzantine. Furthermore, we incorporate communication compression into the method to enhance communication efficiency. Under quite general assumptions, we prove convergence rates for the proposed method that match the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) theoretical results. ",

In this paper, the authors deployed three regression-based ensemble ML models that combine variations of decision trees through Extreme Gradient Boosting, Gradient-boosting Machine, and Random Forest) methods in predicting medical insurance costs. Explainable Artificial Intelligence methods SHapley Additive exPlanations and Individual Conditional Expectation plots were deployed to discover and explain the key determinant factors that influence medical insurance premium prices in the dataset. The dataset used comprised 986 records and is publicly available in the KAGGLE repository. The models were evaluated using four performance evaluation metrics, including R-squared, Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error. The results show that all models produced impressive outcomes; however, the XGBoost model achieved a better overall performance although it also expanded more computational resources, while the RF model recorded a lesser prediction error and consumed far fewer computing resources than the XGBoost model. Furthermore, we compared the outcome of both XAi methods in identifying the key determinant features that influenced the PremiumPrices for each model and whereas both XAi methods produced similar outcomes, we found that the ICE plots showed in more detail the interactions between each variable than the SHAP analysis which seemed to be more high-level. It is the aim of the authors that the contributions of this study will help policymakers, insurers, and potential medical insurance buyers in their decision-making process for selecting the right policies that meet their specific needs.

To address these issues, we combine IL with a variant of robust MPC that accounts for process and sensing uncertainties, and we design a data augmentation (DA) strategy that enables efficient learning of vision-based policies. The proposed DA method, named Tube-NeRF, leverages Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to generate novel synthetic images, and uses properties of the robust MPC (the tube) to select relevant views and to efficiently compute the corresponding actions. We tailor our approach to the task of localization and trajectory tracking on a multirotor, by learning a visuomotor policy that generates control actions using images from the onboard camera as only source of horizontal position. Our evaluations numerically demonstrate learning of a robust visuomotor policy with an 80-fold increase in demonstration efficiency and a 50% reduction in training time over current IL methods. Additionally, our policies successfully transfer to a real multirotor, achieving accurate localization and low tracking errors despite large disturbances, with an onboard inference time of only 1.5 ms.

GigaPose first leverages discriminative templates, rendered images of the CAD models, to recover the out-of-plane rotation and then uses patch correspondences to estimate the four remaining parameters. Our approach samples templates in only a two-degrees-of-freedom space instead of the usual three and matches the input image to the templates using fast nearest neighbor search in feature space, results in a speedup factor of 38x compared to the state of the art. Moreover, GigaPose is significantly more robust to segmentation errors. Our extensive evaluation on the seven core datasets of the BOP challenge demonstrates that it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and can be seamlessly integrated with a refinement method. Additionally, we show the potential of GigaPose with 3D models predicted by recent work on 3D reconstruction from a single image, relaxing the need for CAD models and making 6D pose object estimation much more convenient.

We introduce subgraph tokenization in which the configuration of a set of solution variables is represented by a single token. This tokenization technique alleviates the drawback of the long sequential sampling procedure which is inherent to autoregressive methods without sacrificing expressivity.

The inclusion of this dataset (with eye gaze and head pose information) on top of the standard Columbia Gaze dataset into training the model led to better accuracy with a mean average error below two degrees in eye pitch and yaw directions, which compares favourably to related methods.

Utilizing a susceptible-infected epidemiological process to model the propagation of misinformation, we frame optimal prebunking as a policy synthesis problem with safety constraints. We then propose a policy that approximates the optimal solution to a relaxed problem.

However, these methods often require a significant amount of data to represent a single scene or object. In this work, we present a compression model that aims to minimize the entropy in the frequency domain in order to effectively reduce the data size. First, we propose using the discrete cosine transform (DCT) on the tensorial radiance fields to compress the feature-grid. This feature-grid is transformed into coefficients, which are then quantized and entropy encoded, following a similar approach to the traditional video coding pipeline. Furthermore, to achieve a higher level of sparsity, we propose using an entropy parameterization technique for the frequency domain, specifically for DCT coefficients of the feature-grid. Since the transformed coefficients are optimized during the training phase, the proposed model does not require any fine-tuning or additional information. Our model only requires a lightweight compression pipeline for encoding and decoding, making it easier to apply volumetric radiance field methods for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed frequency domain entropy model can achieve superior compression performance across various datasets.

    "abstract": "Data science projects often involve various machine learning (ML) methods that depend on data, code, and models. One of the key activities in these projects is the selection of a model or algorithm that is appropriate for the data analysis at hand. ML model selection depends on several factors, which include data-related attributes such as sample size, functional requirements such as the prediction algorithm type, and non-functional requirements such as performance and bias. However, the factors that influence such selection are often not well understood and explicitly represented. This paper describes ongoing work on extending an adaptive variability-aware model selection method with bias detection in ML projects. The method involves: (i) modeling the variability of the factors that affect model selection using feature models based on heuristics proposed in the literature; (ii) instantiating our variability model with added features related to bias (e.g., bias-related metrics); and (iii) conducting experiments that illustrate the method in a specific case study to illustrate our approach based on a heart failure prediction project. The proposed approach aims to advance the state of the art by making explicit factors that influence model selection, particularly those related to bias, as well as their interactions. The provided representations can transform model selection in ML projects into a non ad hoc, adaptive, and explainable process. ",

Moreover, compression-based IMD approaches face difficulties in cases of double compression of identical quality factors. To investigate the State-of-The-Art (SoTA) IMD methods in those challenging conditions, we introduce a new Challenging Image Manipulation Detection (CIMD) benchmark dataset, which consists of two subsets, for evaluating editing-based and compression-based IMD methods, respectively. The dataset images were manually taken and tampered with high-quality annotations.

To satisfy this demand, we set our sights on a short-baseline binocular setting that offers both portability and a geometric measurement property that radically mitigates depth ambiguity. However, as the binocular baseline shortens, two serious challenges emerge: first, the robustness of 3D reconstruction against 2D errors deteriorates; and second, occlusion reoccurs due to the limited visual differences between two views. To address the first challenge, we propose the Stereo Co-Keypoints Estimation module to improve the view consistency of 2D keypoints and enhance the 3D robustness. In this module, the disparity is utilized to represent the correspondence of binocular 2D points and the Stereo Volume Feature is introduced to contain binocular features across different disparities. Through the regression of SVF, two-view 2D keypoints are simultaneously estimated in a collaborative way which restricts their view consistency. Furthermore, to deal with occlusions, a Pre-trained Pose Transformer module is introduced. Through this module, 3D poses are refined by perceiving pose coherence, a representation of joint correlations. This perception is injected by the Pose Transformer network and learned through a pre-training task that recovers iterative masked joints. Comprehensive experiments carried out on H36M and MHAD datasets, complemented by visualizations, validate the effectiveness of our approach in the short-baseline binocular 3D Human Pose Estimation and occlusion handling.

In this paper, we propose Disentangled Intervention-based Dynamic graph Attention networks with Invariance Promotion (I-DIDA) to handle spatio-temporal distribution shifts in dynamic graphs by discovering and utilizing invariant patterns, i.e., structures and features whose predictive abilities are stable across distribution shifts. Specifically, we first propose a disentangled spatio-temporal attention network to capture the variant and invariant patterns. By utilizing the disentangled patterns, we design a spatio-temporal intervention mechanism to create multiple interventional distributions and an environment inference module to infer the latent spatio-temporal environments, and minimize the variance of predictions among these intervened distributions and environments, so that our model can make predictions based on invariant patterns with stable predictive abilities under distribution shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under distribution shifts.

Since it is a tough task to ensure that users are fairly influenced in terms of sensitive attributes, such as race or gender, while maintaining a high influence spread. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose an effective and efficient Community-based Evolutionary Algorithm for FIM (named CEA-FIM). In CEA-FIM, a community-based node selection strategy is proposed to identify potential nodes, which not only considers the size of the community but also the attributes of the nodes in the community. Subsequently, we design an evolutionary algorithm based on the proposed node selection strategy to hasten the search for the optimal solution, including the novel initialization, crossover and mutation strategies. We validate the proposed algorithm CEA-FIM by performing experiments on real-world and synthetic networks.

    "abstract": "Social media misinformation harms individuals and societies and is potentialized by fast-growing multi-modal content (i.e., texts and images), which accounts for higher \"credibility\" than text-only news pieces. Although existing supervised misinformation detection methods have obtained acceptable performances in key setups, they may require large amounts of labeled data from various events, which can be time-consuming and tedious. In turn, directly training a model by leveraging a publicly available dataset may fail to generalize due to domain shifts between the training data (a.k.a. source domains) and the data from target domains. Most prior work on domain shift focuses on a single modality (e.g., text modality) and ignores the scenario where sufficient unlabeled target domain data may not be readily available in an early stage. The lack of data often happens due to the dynamic propagation trend (i.e., the number of posts related to fake news increases slowly before catching the public attention). We propose a novel robust domain and cross-modal approach (\\textbf{RDCM}) for multi-modal misinformation detection. It reduces the domain shift by aligning the joint distribution of textual and visual modalities through an inter-domain alignment module and bridges the semantic gap between both modalities through a cross-modality alignment module. We also propose a framework that simultaneously considers application scenarios of domain generalization (in which the target domain data is unavailable) and domain adaptation (in which unlabeled target domain data is available). Evaluation results on two public multi-modal misinformation detection datasets (Pheme and Twitter Datasets) evince the superiority of the proposed model.

    "title": "Large Language Models as Topological Structure Enhancers for  Text-Attributed Graphs",
    "abstract": "The latest advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP). Inspired by the success of LLMs in NLP tasks, some recent work has begun investigating the potential of applying LLMs in graph learning tasks. However, most of the existing work focuses on utilizing LLMs as powerful node feature augmenters, leaving employing LLMs to enhance graph topological structures an understudied problem. In this work, we explore how to leverage the information retrieval and text generation capabilities of LLMs to refine/enhance the topological structure of text-attributed graphs (TAGs) under the node classification setting. First, we propose using LLMs to help remove unreliable edges and add reliable ones in the TAG. Specifically, we first let the LLM output the semantic similarity between node attributes through delicate prompt designs, and then perform edge deletion and edge addition based on the similarity. Second, we propose using pseudo-labels generated by the LLM to improve graph topology, that is, we introduce the pseudo-label propagation as a regularization to guide the graph neural network (GNN) in learning proper edge weights. Finally, we incorporate the two aforementioned LLM-based methods for graph topological refinement into the process of GNN training, and perform extensive experiments on four real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based graph topology refinement (achieving a 0.15%--2.47% performance gain on public benchmarks). ",

Among the core systems of a smart city is the Cooperative-Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS). C-ITS is a system where vehicles provide real-time information to drivers about surrounding traffic conditions, sudden stops, falling objects, and other accident risks through roadside base stations. It consists of road infrastructure, C-ITS centers, and vehicle terminals. However, as smart cities integrate many elements through networks and electronic control, they are susceptible to cybersecurity issues. In the case of cybersecurity problems in C-ITS, there is a significant risk of safety issues arising. This technical document aims to model the C-ITS environment and the services it provides, with the purpose of identifying the attack surface where security incidents could occur in a smart city environment. Subsequently, based on the identified attack surface, the document aims to construct attack scenarios and their respective stages. The document provides a description of the concept of C-ITS, followed by the description of the C-ITS environment model, service model, and attack scenario model defined by us. ",

    "abstract": "The analysis of spatiotemporal data is increasingly utilized across diverse domains, including transportation, healthcare, and meteorology. In real-world settings, such data often contain missing elements due to issues like sensor malfunctions and data transmission errors. The objective of spatiotemporal imputation is to estimate these missing values by understanding the inherent spatial and temporal relationships in the observed multivariate time series. Traditionally, spatiotemporal imputation has relied on specific, intricate architectures designed for this purpose, which suffer from limited applicability and high computational complexity. In contrast, our approach integrates pre-trained large language models (LLMs) into spatiotemporal imputation, introducing a groundbreaking framework, GATGPT. This framework merges a graph attention mechanism with LLMs. We maintain most of the LLM parameters unchanged to leverage existing knowledge for learning temporal patterns, while fine-tuning the upper layers tailored to various applications. The graph attention component enhances the LLM's ability to understand spatial relationships. Through tests on three distinct real-world datasets, our innovative approach demonstrates comparable results to established deep learning benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Cycles are fundamental elements in graph-structured data and have demonstrated their effectiveness in enhancing graph learning models. To encode such information into a graph learning framework, prior works often extract a summary quantity, ranging from the number of cycles to the more sophisticated persistence diagram summaries. However, more detailed information, such as which edges are encoded in a cycle, has not yet been used in graph neural networks. In this paper, we make one step towards addressing this gap, and propose a structure encoding module, called CycleNet, that encodes cycle information via edge structure encoding in a permutation invariant manner. To efficiently encode the space of all cycles, we start with a cycle basis (i.e., a minimal set of cycles generating the cycle space) which we compute via the kernel of the 1-dimensional Hodge Laplacian of the input graph. To guarantee the encoding is invariant w.r.t. the choice of cycle basis, we encode the cycle information via the orthogonal projector of the cycle basis, which is inspired by BasisNet proposed by Lim et al. We also develop a more efficient variant which however requires that the input graph has a unique shortest cycle basis. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed module, we provide some theoretical understandings of its expressive power. Moreover, we show via a range of experiments that networks enhanced by our CycleNet module perform better in various benchmarks compared to several existing SOTA models. ",

By utilizing AI models, attack graphs can be created within a short period, approximating optimal outcomes.

PIANO employs self-supervised learning to extract physical knowledge and attention mechanisms to integrate them into dynamic convolutional layers. Compared to existing techniques, PIANO can reduce the relative error by 13.6\\%-82.2\\% on PDE forecasting tasks across varying coefficients, forces, or boundary conditions. Additionally, varied downstream tasks reveal that the PI embeddings deciphered by PIANO align well with the underlying invariants in the PDE systems, verifying the physical significance of PIANO.

While the existing well works primarily focus on minimizing the modal discrepancies, the modality information can not thoroughly be leveraged. To solve this problem, a Multi-scale Semantic Correlation Mining network (MSCMNet) is proposed to comprehensively exploit semantic features at multiple scales and simultaneously reduce modality information loss as small as possible in feature extraction. The proposed network contains three novel components. Firstly, after taking into account the effective utilization of modality information, the Multi-scale Information Correlation Mining Block (MIMB) is designed to explore semantic correlations across multiple scales. Secondly, in order to enrich the semantic information that MIMB can utilize, a quadruple-stream feature extractor (QFE) with non-shared parameters is specifically designed to extract information from different dimensions of the dataset. Finally, the Quadruple Center Triplet Loss (QCT) is further proposed to address the information discrepancy in the comprehensive features. Extensive experiments on the SYSU-MM01, RegDB, and LLCM datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSCMNet achieves the greatest accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "General purpose segmentation models are able to generate (semantic) segmentation masks from a variety of prompts, including visual (points, boxed, etc.) and textual (object names) ones. In particular, input images are pre-processed by an image encoder to obtain embedding vectors which are later used for mask predictions. Existing adversarial attacks target the end-to-end tasks, i.e. aim at altering the segmentation mask predicted for a specific image-prompt pair. However, this requires running an individual attack for each new prompt for the same image. We propose instead to generate prompt-agnostic adversarial attacks by maximizing the $\\ell_2$-distance, in the latent space, between the embedding of the original and perturbed images. Since the encoding process only depends on the image, distorted image representations will cause perturbations in the segmentation masks for a variety of prompts. We show that even imperceptible $\\ell_\\infty$-bounded perturbations of radius $\\epsilon=1/255$ are often sufficient to drastically modify the masks predicted with point, box and text prompts by recently proposed foundation models for segmentation. Moreover, we explore the possibility of creating universal, i.e. non image-specific, attacks which can be readily applied to any input without further computational cost. ",

To detect network faults, and mitigate future failures, prior work focused on leveraging traditional ML/DL methods to locate anomalies in networks. The current approaches, although powerful, do not consider the intertwined nature of embedded and software-intensive Radio Access Network systems. In this paper, we propose a Bi-level Federated Graph Neural Network anomaly detection and diagnosis model that is able to detect anomalies in Telecom networks in a privacy-preserving manner, while minimizing communication costs. Our method revolves around conceptualizing Telecom data as a bi-level temporal Graph Neural Networks. The first graph captures the interactions between different RAN nodes that are exposed to different deployment scenarios in the network, while each individual Radio Access Network node is further elaborated into its software (SW) execution graph. Additionally, we use Federated Learning to address privacy and security limitations. Furthermore, we study the performance of anomaly detection model under three settings: (1) Centralized (2) Federated Learning and (3) Personalized Federated Learning using real-world data from an operational network.

    "abstract": "With the evolution of blockchain technology, the issue of transaction security, particularly on platforms like Ethereum, has become increasingly critical. Front-running attacks, a unique form of security threat, pose significant challenges to the integrity of blockchain transactions. In these attack scenarios, malicious actors monitor other users' transaction activities, then strategically submit their own transactions with higher fees. This ensures their transactions are executed before the monitored transactions are included in the block. The primary objective of this paper is to delve into a comprehensive classification of transactions associated with front-running attacks, which aims to equip developers with specific strategies to counter each type of attack. To achieve this, we introduce a novel detection method named FRAD (Front-Running Attacks Detection on Ethereum using Ternary Classification Model). This method is specifically tailored for transactions within decentralized applications (DApps) on Ethereum, enabling accurate classification of front-running attacks involving transaction displacement, insertion, and suppression. Our experimental validation reveals that the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifier offers the best performance in detecting front-running attacks, achieving an impressive accuracy rate of 84.59% and F1-score of 84.60%.

Motivated by applications in 3D morphing problems, we initiate the study of morphing graph drawings in the plane in the presence of stationary point obstacles, which need to be avoided throughout the deformation. As our main result, we prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether such an obstacle-avoiding 2D morph between two given drawings of the same graph exists. This is in sharp contrast to the classical case without obstacles, where there is an efficiently verifiable (necessary and sufficient) criterion for the existence of a morph. ",

    "abstract": "The dramatic increase in the connectivity demand results in an excessive amount of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. To meet the management needs of these large-scale networks, such as accurate monitoring and learning capabilities, Digital Twin (DT) is the key enabler. However, current attempts regarding DT implementations remain insufficient due to the perpetual connectivity requirements of IoT networks. Furthermore, the sensor data streaming in IoT networks cause higher processing time than traditional methods. In addition to these, the current intelligent mechanisms cannot perform well due to the spatiotemporal changes in the implemented IoT network scenario. To handle these challenges, we propose a DT-native AI-driven service architecture in support of the concept of IoT networks. Within the proposed DT-native architecture, we implement a TCP-based data flow pipeline and a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based learner model. We apply the proposed architecture to one of the broad concepts of IoT networks, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). We measure the efficiency of our proposed architecture and note ~30% processing time-saving thanks to the TCP-based data flow pipeline. Moreover, we test the performance of the learner model by applying several learning rate combinations for actor and critic networks and highlight the most successive model. ",

In this paper, we present a novel approach that leverages text-derived statistics to predict the mean and covariance of the visual feature distribution for each class. This predictive framework enriches the latent space, yielding more robust and generalizable few-shot learning models. We demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating both mean and covariance statistics in improving few-shot classification performance across various datasets. Our method shows that we can use text to predict the mean and covariance of the distribution offering promising improvements in few-shot learning scenarios. ",

Although some evolutionary approaches to such problems utilize the bit strings of a genetic algorithm, it is more common to directly represent solutions with permutations. Evolving permutations directly requires specialized evolutionary operators. Over the years, many crossover and mutation operators have been developed for solving permutation problems with evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, we survey the breadth of evolutionary operators for permutations. We implemented all of these in Chips-n-Salsa, an open source Java library for evolutionary computation.

    "abstract": "Most applications of machine learning to classification assume a closed set of balanced classes. This is at odds with the real world, where class occurrence statistics often follow a long-tailed power-law distribution and it is unlikely that all classes are seen in a single sample. Nonparametric Bayesian models naturally capture this phenomenon, but have significant practical barriers to widespread adoption, namely implementation complexity and computational inefficiency. To address this, we present a method for extracting the inductive bias from a nonparametric Bayesian model and transferring it to an artificial neural network. By simulating data with a nonparametric Bayesian prior, we can metalearn a sequence model that performs inference over an unlimited set of classes. After training, this \"neural circuit\" has distilled the corresponding inductive bias and can successfully perform sequential inference over an open set of classes. Our experimental results show that the metalearned neural circuit achieves comparable or better performance than particle filter-based methods for inference in these models while being faster and simpler to use than methods that explicitly incorporate Bayesian nonparametric inference.

Given that such crises may introduce a shift in market dynamics, this study aims to investigate whether the training data from market dynamics prior to the crisis are compatible with the data during the crisis period. To this end, two distinct learning environments are designed to evaluate and reconcile the effects of possibly different market dynamics. These environments differ principally based on the role assigned to the pre-crisis data. In both environments, a set of non-dominated architectures are identified to satisfy the multi-criteria co-evolution problem, which simultaneously addresses the selection issues related to features and hidden layer topology. To test the hypothesis of pre-crisis data incompatibility, the day-ahead movement prediction of the NASDAQ index is considered during two recent and major market disruptions; the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of a detailed comparative evaluation convincingly support the incompatibility hypothesis and highlight the need to select re-training windows carefully. ",

However, despite its practical performance, the theoretical analysis of orthonormality in neural networks is still lacking; for example, how orthonormality affects the convergence of the training process. In this letter, we aim to bridge this gap by providing convergence analysis for training orthonormal deep linear neural networks. Specifically, we show that Riemannian gradient descent with an appropriate initialization converges at a linear rate for training orthonormal deep linear neural networks with a class of loss functions. Unlike existing works that enforce orthonormal weight matrices for all the layers, our approach excludes this requirement for one layer, which is crucial to establish the convergence guarantee. Our results shed light on how increasing the number of hidden layers can impact the convergence speed. Experimental results validate our theoretical analysis. ",

What is more, most exponential speedups in quantum computation are obtained by solving instances of the HSP. A common feature of the resulting algorithms is the use of quantum coset states, which encode the hidden subgroup. An open question has been how hard it is to use these states to solve graph isomorphism. It was recently shown by Moore, Russell, and Schulman that only an exponentially small amount of information is available from one, or a pair of coset states. A potential source of power to exploit are entangled quantum measurements that act jointly on many states at once. We show that entangled quantum measurements on at least \\Omega(n log n) coset states are necessary to get useful information for the case of graph isomorphism, matching an information theoretic upper bound. This may be viewed as a negative result because highly entangled measurements seem hard to implement in general. Our main theorem is very general and also rules out using joint measurements on few coset states for some other groups, such as GL(n, F_{p^m}) and G^n where G is finite and satisfies a suitable property.

In response, we introduce HybridVNet, a novel architecture for direct image-to-mesh extraction seamlessly integrating standard convolutional neural networks with graph convolutions, which we prove can efficiently handle surface and volumetric meshes by encoding them as graph structures. To further enhance accuracy, we propose a multiview HybridVNet architecture which processes both long axis and short axis CMR, showing that it can increase the performance of cardiac MR mesh generation. Our model combines traditional convolutional networks with variational graph generative models, deep supervision and mesh-specific regularisation.

PMTS could fit the brn=0 on the LM detectors with little errors both in time domain and frequency domain. The n>0 pick-up brn>0 generated by resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) can be obtained after subtracting the extracted brn=0. This new method uses only one LM instead of 4 LM detectors to extract brn=0. Therefore, the distribution of the LM detectors can also be optimized based on this new method. ",

    "abstract": "Real-time or near real-time hyperspectral detection and identification are extremely useful and needed in many fields. These data sets can be quite large, and the algorithms can require numerous computations that slow the process down. A common way of speeding up the process is to use principal component analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction. In the reduced dimensional space, provided by a subset of the principal components, fewer computations are needed to process the data resulting in a faster run time. In this paper, we propose a way to further decrease the time required to use PCA by investigating how many principal components may be omitted with minimal impact on the detection rate. Using ACE to perform the detection, and then probability, and spectral fit for identification, we find that the number of principal components can be reduced by a substantial amount before seeing a noticeable change in detection rates.

    "title": "Bridging Classical and Quantum Machine Learning: Knowledge Transfer From  Classical to Quantum Neural Networks Using Knowledge Distillation",
    "abstract": "Very recently, studies have shown that quantum neural networks surpass classical neural networks in tasks like image classification when a similar number of learnable parameters are used. However, the development and optimization of quantum models are currently hindered by issues such as qubit instability and limited qubit availability, leading to error-prone systems with weak performance. In contrast, classical models can exhibit high-performance owing to substantial resource availability. As a result, more studies have been focusing on hybrid classical-quantum integration. A line of research particularly focuses on transfer learning through classical-quantum integration or quantum-quantum approaches. Unlike previous studies, this paper introduces a new method to transfer knowledge from classical to quantum neural networks using knowledge distillation, effectively bridging the gap between classical machine learning and emergent quantum computing techniques. We adapt classical convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures like LeNet and AlexNet to serve as teacher networks, facilitating the training of student quantum models by sending supervisory signals during backpropagation through KL-divergence. The approach yields significant performance improvements for the quantum models by solely depending on classical CNNs, with quantum models achieving an average accuracy improvement of 0.80% on the MNIST dataset and 5.40% on the more complex Fashion MNIST dataset. Applying this technique eliminates the cumbersome training of huge quantum models for transfer learning in resource-constrained settings and enables re-using existing pre-trained classical models to improve performance.Thus, this study paves the way for future research in quantum machine learning (QML) by positioning knowledge distillation as a core technique for advancing QML applications.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is emerging as a transformative tool for the design of architected materials, offering properties that far surpass those achievable through lab-based trial-and-error methods. However, a major challenge in current inverse design strategies is their reliance on extensive computational and/or experimental datasets, which becomes particularly problematic for designing micro-scale stochastic architected materials that exhibit nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Here, we introduce a new end-to-end scientific ML framework, leveraging deep neural operators (DeepONet), to directly learn the relationship between the complete microstructure and mechanical response of architected metamaterials from sparse but high-quality in situ experimental data. The approach facilitates the inverse design of structures tailored to specific nonlinear mechanical behaviors. Results obtained from spinodal microstructures, printed using two-photon lithography, reveal that the prediction error for mechanical responses is within a range of 5 - 10%. Our work underscores that by employing neural operators with advanced micro-mechanics experimental techniques, the design of complex micro-architected materials with desired properties becomes feasible, even in scenarios constrained by data scarcity. Our work marks a significant advancement in the field of materials-by-design, potentially heralding a new era in the discovery and development of next-generation metamaterials with unparalleled mechanical characteristics derived directly from experimental insights.

    "abstract": "The Temporal Sampling Framework (TSF) theorizes that the characteristic phonological difficulties of dyslexia are caused by an atypical oscillatory sampling at one or more temporal rates. The LEEDUCA study conducted a series of Electroencephalography (EEG) experiments on children listening to amplitude modulated (AM) noise with slow-rythmic prosodic (0.5-1 Hz), syllabic (4-8 Hz) or the phoneme (12-40 Hz) rates, aimed at detecting differences in perception of oscillatory sampling that could be associated with dyslexia. The purpose of this work is to check whether these differences exist and how they are related to children's performance in different language and cognitive tasks commonly used to detect dyslexia. To this purpose, temporal and spectral inter-channel EEG connectivity was estimated, and a denoising autoencoder (DAE) was trained to learn a low-dimensional representation of the connectivity matrices. This representation was studied via correlation and classification analysis, which revealed ability in detecting dyslexic subjects with an accuracy higher than 0.8, and balanced accuracy around 0.7. Some features of the DAE representation were significantly correlated ($p<0.005$) with children's performance in language and cognitive tasks of the phonological hypothesis category such as phonological awareness and rapid symbolic naming, as well as reading efficiency and reading comprehension. Finally, a deeper analysis of the adjacency matrix revealed a reduced bilateral connection between electrodes of the temporal lobe (roughly the primary auditory cortex) in DD subjects, as well as an increased connectivity of the F7 electrode, placed roughly on Broca's area. These results pave the way for a complementary assessment of dyslexia using more objective methodologies such as EEG. ",

    "abstract": "In the context of natural disasters, human responses inevitably intertwine with natural factors. The COVID-19 pandemic, as a significant stress factor, has brought to light profound variations among different countries in terms of their adaptive dynamics in addressing the spread of infection outbreaks across different regions. This emphasizes the crucial role of cultural characteristics in natural disaster analysis. The theoretical understanding of large-scale epidemics primarily relies on mean-field kinetic models. However, conventional SIR-like models failed to fully explain the observed phenomena at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. These phenomena included the unexpected cessation of exponential growth, the reaching of plateaus, and the occurrence of multi-wave dynamics. In situations where an outbreak of a highly virulent and unfamiliar infection arises, it becomes crucial to respond swiftly at a non-medical level to mitigate the negative socio-economic impact. Here we present a theoretical examination of the first wave of the epidemic based on a simple SIRSS model (SIR with Social Stress). We conduct an analysis of the socio-cultural features of na\\\"ive population behaviors across various countries worldwide. The unique characteristics of each country/territory are encapsulated in only a few constants within our model, derived from the fitted COVID-19 statistics. These constants also reflect the societal response dynamics to the external stress factor, underscoring the importance of studying the mutual behavior of humanity and natural factors during global social disasters. Based on these distinctive characteristics of specific regions, local authorities can optimize their strategies to effectively combat epidemics until vaccines are developed. ",

In this paper, we present an implementation of knowledge distillation, demonstrating an overall boost in the student models' performance for the task of classifying jets at the LHC.

    "abstract": "Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) is a common and challenging condition to diagnose accurately. Timely and precise diagnosis is essential for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods for mTBI often have limitations in terms of accuracy and sensitivity. In this study, we introduce an innovative approach to enhance mTBI diagnosis using 3D Computed Tomography (CT) images and a metric learning technique trained with triplet loss. To address these challenges, we propose a Residual Triplet Convolutional Neural Network (RTCNN) model to distinguish between mTBI cases and healthy ones by embedding 3D CT scans into a feature space. The triplet loss function maximizes the margin between similar and dissimilar image pairs, optimizing feature representations. This facilitates better context placement of individual cases, aids informed decision-making, and has the potential to improve patient outcomes. Our RTCNN model shows promising performance in mTBI diagnosis, achieving an average accuracy of 94.3%, a sensitivity of 94.1%, and a specificity of 95.2%, as confirmed through a five-fold cross-validation. Importantly, when compared to the conventional Residual Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) model, the RTCNN exhibits a significant improvement, showcasing a remarkable 22.5% increase in specificity, a notable 16.2% boost in accuracy, and an 11.3% enhancement in sensitivity. Moreover, RTCNN requires lower memory resources, making it not only highly effective but also resource-efficient in minimizing false positives while maximizing its diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing normal CT scans from mTBI cases. The quantitative performance metrics provided and utilization of occlusion sensitivity maps to visually explain the model's decision-making process further enhance the interpretability and transparency of our approach.

    "abstract": "The novel 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) global pandemic is a defining health crisis. Recent efforts have been increasingly directed towards achieving quick and accurate detection of COVID-19 across symptomatic patients to mitigate the intensity and spread of the disease. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms applied to chest X-ray (CXR) images have emerged as promising diagnostic tools, and previous work has demonstrated impressive classification performances. However, such methods have faced criticisms from physicians due to their black-box reasoning process and unpredictable nature. In contrast to professional radiologist diagnosis, AI systems often lack generalizability, explainability, and robustness in the clinical decision making process. In our work, we address these issues by first proposing an extensive baseline study, training and evaluating 21 convolutional neural network (CNN) models on a diverse set of 33,000+ CXR images to classify between healthy, COVID-19, and non-COVID-19 pneumonia CXRs. Our resulting models achieved a 3-way classification accuracy, recall, and precision of up to 97.03\\%, 97.97\\%, and 99.95\\%, respectively. Next, we investigate the effectiveness of adversarial training on model robustness and explainability via Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) heatmaps. We find that adversarially trained models not only significantly outperform their standard counterparts on classifying perturbed images, but also yield saliency maps that 1) better specify clinically relevant features, 2) are robust against extraneous artifacts, and 3) agree considerably more with expert radiologist findings.

    "abstract": "Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection and mitigation is critical for enabling and maximising the scientific output of radio telescopes. The emergence of machine learning methods capable of handling large datasets has led to their application in radio astronomy, particularly in RFI detection. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological systems, are well-suited for processing spatio-temporal data. This study introduces the first application of SNNs to an astronomical data-processing task, specifically RFI detection. We adapt the nearest-latent-neighbours (NLN) algorithm and auto-encoder architecture proposed by previous authors to SNN execution by direct ANN2SNN conversion, enabling simplified downstream RFI detection by sampling the naturally varying latent space from the internal spiking neurons. We evaluate performance with the simulated HERA telescope and hand-labelled LOFAR dataset that the original authors provided. We additionally evaluate performance with a new MeerKAT-inspired simulation dataset. This dataset focuses on satellite-based RFI, an increasingly important class of RFI and is, therefore, an additional contribution. Our SNN approach remains competitive with the original NLN algorithm and AOFlagger in AUROC, AUPRC and F1 scores for the HERA dataset but exhibits difficulty in the LOFAR and MeerKAT datasets. However, our method maintains this performance while completely removing the compute and memory-intense latent sampling step found in NLN. This work demonstrates the viability of SNNs as a promising avenue for machine-learning-based RFI detection in radio telescopes by establishing a minimal performance baseline on traditional and nascent satellite-based RFI sources and is the first work to our knowledge to apply SNNs in astronomy.

To dynamically model the change process of wind speed, this paper extracts time series in both history and future directions simultaneously.

We use four data sets of different sizes to test the algorithm's accuracy. We compare the results with traditional link prediction models involving both static and temporal networks. Among our findings, we note that the proposed algorithm is superior to conventional methods, with the average accuracy improved by approximately 2% - 5%. We identify different evolution patterns of four network topologies -- a proximity network, a communication network, transportation data, and a collaboration network. We found that: (1) timescale similarity contributes more to the evolution of the human contact network and the human communication network; (2) such contribution is not observed through a transportation network whose evolution pattern is more dependent on network structure than on the behavior of regional agents; (3) both timescale similarity and local structural similarity contribute to the collaboration network.
