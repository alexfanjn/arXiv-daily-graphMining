    "abstract": "Product embedding serves as a cornerstone for a wide range of applications in eCommerce. The product embedding learned from multiple modalities shows significant improvement over that from a single modality, since different modalities provide complementary information. However, some modalities are more informatively dominant than others. How to teach a model to learn embedding from different modalities without neglecting information from the less dominant modality is challenging. We present an image-text embedding model (ITEm), an unsupervised learning method that is designed to better attend to image and text modalities. We extend BERT by (1) learning an embedding from text and image without knowing the regions of interest; (2) training a global representation to predict masked words and to construct masked image patches without their individual representations. We evaluate the pre-trained ITEm on two tasks: the search for extremely similar products and the prediction of product categories, showing substantial gains compared to strong baseline models. ",

    "abstract": "Third-generation artificial neural networks, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), can be efficiently implemented on hardware. Their implementation on neuromorphic chips opens a broad range of applications, such as machine learning-based autonomous control and intelligent biomedical devices. In critical applications, however, insight into the reasoning of SNNs is important, thus SNNs need to be equipped with the ability to explain how decisions are reached. We present \\textit{Temporal Spike Attribution} (TSA), a local explanation method for SNNs. To compute the explanation, we aggregate all information available in model-internal variables: spike times and model weights. We evaluate TSA on artificial and real-world time series data and measure explanation quality w.r.t. multiple quantitative criteria. We find that TSA correctly identifies a small subset of input features relevant to the decision (i.e., is output-complete and compact) and generates similar explanations for similar inputs (i.e., is continuous). Further, our experiments show that incorporating the notion of \\emph{absent} spikes improves explanation quality. Our work can serve as a starting point for explainable SNNs, with future implementations on hardware yielding not only predictions but also explanations in a broad range of application scenarios.

    "abstract": "While robust graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely studied for graph perturbation and attack, those for label noise have received significantly less attention. Most existing methods heavily rely on the label smoothness assumption to correct noisy labels, which adversely affects their performance on heterophilous graphs. Further, they generally perform poorly in high noise-rate scenarios. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic graphical model (PGM) based framework LNP. Given a noisy label set and a clean label set, our goal is to maximize the likelihood of labels in the clean set. We first present LNP-v1, which generates clean labels based on graphs only in the Bayesian network. To further leverage the information of clean labels in the noisy label set, we put forward LNP-v2, which incorporates the noisy label set into the Bayesian network to generate clean labels. The generative process can then be used to predict labels for unlabeled nodes. We conduct extensive experiments to show the robustness of LNP on varying noise types and rates, and also on graphs with different heterophilies. In particular, we show that LNP can lead to inspiring performance in high noise-rate situations. ",

    "abstract": "Graph research, the systematic study of interconnected data points represented as graphs, plays a vital role in capturing intricate relationships within networked systems. However, in the real world, as graphs scale up, concerns about data security among different data-owning agencies arise, hindering information sharing and, ultimately, the utilization of graph data. Therefore, establishing a mutual trust mechanism among graph agencies is crucial for unlocking the full potential of graphs. Here, we introduce a Cooperative Network Learning (CNL) framework to ensure secure graph computing for various graph tasks. Essentially, this CNL framework unifies the local and global perspectives of GNN computing with distributed data for an agency by virtually connecting all participating agencies as a global graph without a fixed central coordinator. Inter-agency computing is protected by various technologies inherent in our framework, including homomorphic encryption and secure transmission. Moreover, each agency has a fair right to design or employ various graph learning models from its local or global perspective. Thus, CNL can collaboratively train GNN models based on decentralized graphs inferred from local and global graphs. Experiments on contagion dynamics prediction and traditional graph tasks (i.e., node classification and link prediction) demonstrate that our CNL architecture outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs developed at individual sites, revealing that CNL can provide a reliable, fair, secure, privacy-preserving, and global perspective to build effective and personalized models for network applications. We hope this framework will address privacy concerns in graph-related research and integrate decentralized graph data structures to benefit the network research community in cooperation and innovation.

Modelling physical systems, learning molecular signatures, identifying protein interactions and predicting diseases involve utilising a model that can adapt from graph data. Graph neural networks (GNNs), specified as artificial-neural models, employ message transmission between graph nodes to represent graph dependencies and are primarily used in the non-Euclidean domain. Variants of GNN like Graph Recurrent Networks (GRN), Graph Auto Encoder (GAE), Graph Convolution Networks (GCN), Graph Adversarial Methods & Graph Reinforcement learning have exhibited breakthrough productivity on a wide range of tasks, especially in the field of bioinformatics, in recent years as a result of the rapid collection of biological network data. Apart from presenting all existing GNN models, mathematical analysis and comparison of the variants of all types of GNN have been highlighted in this survey. Graph neural networks are investigated for their potential real-world applications in various fields, focusing on Bioinformatics. Furthermore, resources for evaluating graph neural network models and accessing open-source code & benchmark data sets are included. Ultimately, we provide some (seven) proposals for future research in this rapidly evolving domain.

    "abstract": "Learning in high-dimensional action spaces is a key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world systems. In this paper, we study the possibility of controlling power networks using RL methods. Power networks are critical infrastructures that are complex to control. In particular, the combinatorial nature of the action space poses a challenge to both conventional optimizers and learned controllers. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) represents one approach to address this challenge. More precisely, a HRL framework for power network topology control is proposed. The HRL framework consists of three levels of action abstraction. At the highest level, there is the overall long-term task of power network operation, namely, keeping the power grid state within security constraints at all times, which is decomposed into two temporally extended actions: 'do nothing' versus 'propose a topology change'. At the intermediate level, the action space consists of all controllable substations. Finally, at the lowest level, the action space consists of all configurations of the chosen substation. By employing this HRL framework, several hierarchical power network agents are trained for the IEEE 14-bus network. Whereas at the highest level a purely rule-based policy is still chosen for all agents in this study, at the intermediate level the policy is trained using different state-of-the-art RL algorithms. At the lowest level, either an RL algorithm or a greedy algorithm is used. The performance of the different 3-level agents is compared with standard baseline (RL or greedy) approaches. A key finding is that the 3-level agent that employs RL both at the intermediate and the lowest level outperforms all other agents on the most difficult task. Our code is publicly available. ",

In this work, we introduce SparseDiff, a denoising diffusion model for graph generation that is able to exploit sparsity during its training phase. At the core of SparseDiff is a message-passing neural network tailored to predict only a subset of edges during each forward pass. When combined with a sparsity-preserving noise model, this model can efficiently work with edge lists representations of graphs, paving the way for scalability to much larger structures. During the sampling phase, SparseDiff iteratively populates the adjacency matrix from its prior state, ensuring prediction of the full graph while controlling memory utilization. Experimental results show that SparseDiff simultaneously matches state-of-the-art in generation performance on both small and large graphs, highlighting the versatility of our method. ",

However, most existing retrieval methods heavily rely on cross-attention mechanisms for cross-modal fine-grained alignment, which takes into account excessive irrelevant regions and treats prominent and non-significant words equally, thereby limiting retrieval accuracy. This paper aims to investigate an alignment approach that reduces the involvement of non-significant fragments in images and text while enhancing the alignment of prominent segments. For this purpose, we introduce the Cross-Modal Prominent Fragments Enhancement Aligning Network(CPFEAN), which achieves improved retrieval accuracy by diminishing the participation of irrelevant regions during alignment and relatively increasing the alignment similarity of prominent words. Additionally, we incorporate prior textual information into image regions to reduce misalignment occurrences. In practice, we first design a novel intra-modal fragments relationship reasoning method, and subsequently employ our proposed alignment mechanism to compute the similarity between images and text. Extensive quantitative comparative experiments on MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by about 5% to 10% in the rSum metric. ",

In this paper, we propose a method for learning to make collages via reinforcement learning without the need for demonstrations or collage artwork data.

Moreover, we devise additional techniques such as active material selection and complexity-based multi-scale collage to handle target images at any size and enhance the results' aesthetics by placing relatively more scraps in areas of high complexity.

Foundation models have recently demonstrated impressive zero-shot inference capabilities and robustness under distribution shifts. However, zero-shot evaluation for these models has been predominantly confined to benchmarks with simple distribution shifts, limiting our understanding of their effectiveness under the more realistic shifts found in practice. Moreover, common fine-tuning methods for these models have yet to be evaluated against vision models in few-shot scenarios where training data is limited. To address these gaps, we present a new recipe for few-shot fine-tuning of the popular vision-language foundation model CLIP and evaluate its performance on challenging benchmark datasets with realistic distribution shifts from the WILDS collection. Our experimentation demonstrates that, while zero-shot CLIP fails to match performance of trained vision models on more complex benchmarks, few-shot CLIP fine-tuning outperforms its vision-only counterparts in terms of in-distribution and out-of-distribution accuracy at all levels of training data availability. This provides a strong incentive for adoption of foundation models within few-shot learning applications operating with real-world data.

Therefore, an efficient data fusion strategy is demanded. In this research, we presented a Denoising Multi-Modal Autoencoder with a unique training strategy based on contrastive learning paradigm, both being utilized for the first time in the machine health monitoring realm. The presented approach, which leverages the merits of both supervised and unsupervised learning, not only achieves excellent performance in fusing multiple modalities (or views) of data into an enriched common representation but also takes data fusion to the next level wherein one of the views can be omitted during inference time with very slight performance reduction, or even without any reduction at all. The presented methodology enables multi-modal fault diagnosis systems to perform more robustly in case of sensor failure occurrence, and one can also intentionally omit one of the sensors (the more expensive one) in order to build a more cost-effective condition monitoring system without sacrificing performance for practical purposes. The effectiveness of the presented methodology is examined on a real-world private multi-modal dataset gathered under non-laboratory conditions from a complex engineered mechanism, an inline four-stroke spark-ignition engine, aiming for spark plug fault diagnosis.

Furthermore, these approaches failed to leverage the inherent interconnectedness among different code-related tasks. To overcome these limitations, we present a multi-task fine-tuning framework, MFTcoder, that enables simultaneous and parallel fine-tuning on multiple tasks. By incorporating various loss functions, we effectively address common challenges in multi-task learning, such as data imbalance, varying difficulty levels, and inconsistent convergence speeds.

    "abstract": "While High Definition (HD) Maps have long been favored for their precise depictions of static road elements, their accessibility constraints and susceptibility to rapid environmental changes impede the widespread deployment of autonomous driving, especially in the motion forecasting task. In this context, we propose to leverage OpenStreetMap (OSM) as a promising alternative to HD Maps for long-term motion forecasting. The contributions of this work are threefold: firstly, we extend the application of OSM to long-horizon forecasting, doubling the forecasting horizon compared to previous studies. Secondly, through an expanded receptive field and the integration of intersection priors, our OSM-based approach exhibits competitive performance, narrowing the gap with HD Map-based models. Lastly, we conduct an exhaustive context-aware analysis, providing deeper insights in motion forecasting across diverse scenarios as well as conducting class-aware comparisons. This research not only advances long-term motion forecasting with coarse map representations but additionally offers a potential scalable solution within the domain of autonomous driving. ",

    "abstract": "Large-scale semantic mapping is crucial for outdoor autonomous agents to fulfill high-level tasks such as planning and navigation. This paper proposes a novel method for large-scale 3D semantic reconstruction through implicit representations from LiDAR measurements alone. We firstly leverages an octree-based and hierarchical structure to store implicit features, then these implicit features are decoded to semantic information and signed distance value through shallow Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). We adopt off-the-shelf algorithms to predict the semantic labels and instance IDs of point cloud. Then we jointly optimize the implicit features and MLPs parameters with self-supervision paradigm for point cloud geometry and pseudo-supervision pradigm for semantic and panoptic labels. Subsequently, Marching Cubes algorithm is exploited to subdivide and visualize the scenes in the inferring stage. For scenarios with memory constraints, a map stitching strategy is also developed to merge sub-maps into a complete map. As far as we know, our method is the first work to reconstruct semantic implicit scenes from LiDAR-only input. Experiments on three real-world datasets, SemanticKITTI, SemanticPOSS and nuScenes, demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework compared to current state-of-the-art 3D mapping methods.

    "abstract": "Manatees are aquatic mammals with voracious appetites. They rely on sea grass as the main food source, and often spend up to eight hours a day grazing. They move slow and frequently stay in group (i.e. aggregations) in shallow water to search for food, making them vulnerable to environment change and other risks. Accurate counting manatee aggregations within a region is not only biologically meaningful in observing their habit, but also crucial for designing safety rules for human boaters, divers, etc., as well as scheduling nursing, intervention, and other plans. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based crowd counting approach to automatically count number of manatees within a region, by using low quality images as input. Because manatees have unique shape and they often stay in shallow water in groups, water surface reflection, occlusion, camouflage etc. making it difficult to accurately count manatee numbers. To address the challenges, we propose to use Anisotropic Gaussian Kernel (AGK), with tunable rotation and variances, to ensure that density functions can maximally capture shapes of individual manatees in different aggregations. After that, we apply AGK kernel to different types of deep neural networks primarily designed for crowd counting, including VGG, SANet, Congested Scene Recognition network (CSRNet), MARUNet etc. to learn manatee densities and calculate number of manatees in the scene. By using generic low quality images extracted from surveillance videos, our experiment results and comparison show that AGK kernel based manatee counting achieves minimum Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The proposed method works particularly well for counting manatee aggregations in environments with complex background. ",

    "abstract": "To solve the spatial problems of mapping, localization and navigation, the mammalian lineage has developed striking spatial representations. One important spatial representation is the Nobel-prize winning grid cells: neurons that represent self-location, a local and aperiodic quantity, with seemingly bizarre non-local and spatially periodic activity patterns of a few discrete periods. Why has the mammalian lineage learnt this peculiar grid representation? Mathematical analysis suggests that this multi-periodic representation has excellent properties as an algebraic code with high capacity and intrinsic error-correction, but to date, there is no satisfactory synthesis of core principles that lead to multi-modular grid cells in deep recurrent neural networks. In this work, we begin by identifying key insights from four families of approaches to answering the grid cell question: coding theory, dynamical systems, function optimization and supervised deep learning. We then leverage our insights to propose a new approach that combines the strengths of all four approaches. Our approach is a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework - including data, data augmentations, loss functions and a network architecture - motivated from a normative perspective, without access to supervised position information or engineering of particular readout representations as needed in previous approaches. We show that multiple grid cell modules can emerge in networks trained on our SSL framework and that the networks and emergent representations generalize well outside their training distribution. This work contains insights for neuroscientists interested in the origins of grid cells as well as machine learning researchers interested in novel SSL frameworks. ",

In particular, we study the conditions for achieving \\emph{connectivity} {with high probability} and for the existence of a \\emph{giant component} with formal guarantees on the size of the largest connected component in terms of the parameters $n,~K$, and $\\gamma_n$. Next, we analyze the property of \\emph{$r$-robustness} which is a stronger property than connectivity and leads to resilient consensus in the presence of malicious nodes. We derive conditions on $K$ and $n$ under which the random K-out graph achieves r-robustness with high probability.

However, traditional differentially private mechanisms tend to produce unbounded outputs in order to achieve maximum disturbance range, which is not always in line with real-world applications. Existing solutions attempt to address this issue by employing post-processing or truncation techniques to restrict the output results, but at the cost of introducing bias issues. In this paper, we propose a novel differentially private mechanism which uses a composite probability density function to generate bounded and unbiased outputs for any numerical input data. The composition consists of an activation function and a base function, providing users with the flexibility to define the functions according to the DP constraints. We also develop an optimization algorithm that enables the iterative search for the optimal hyper-parameter setting without the need for repeated experiments, which prevents additional privacy overhead. Furthermore, we evaluate the utility of the proposed mechanism by assessing the variance of the composite probability density function and introducing two alternative metrics that are simpler to compute than variance estimation. Our extensive evaluation on three benchmark datasets demonstrates consistent and significant improvement over the traditional Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms. The proposed bounded and unbiased composite differentially private mechanism will underpin the broader DP arsenal and foster future privacy-preserving studies. ",

    "abstract": "Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) attacks have plagued modern enterprises, causing significant financial losses. To counter these attacks, researchers propose techniques that capture the complex and stealthy scenarios of APT attacks by using provenance graphs to model system entities and their dependencies. Particularly, to accelerate attack detection and reduce financial losses, online provenance-based detection systems that detect and investigate APT attacks under the constraints of timeliness and limited resources are in dire need. Unfortunately, existing online systems usually sacrifice detection granularity to reduce computational complexity and produce provenance graphs with more than 100,000 nodes, posing challenges for security admins to interpret the detection results. In this paper, we design and implement NodLink, the first online detection system that maintains high detection accuracy without sacrificing detection granularity. Our insight is that the APT attack detection process in online provenance-based detection systems can be modeled as a Steiner Tree Problem (STP), which has efficient online approximation algorithms that recover concise attack-related provenance graphs with a theoretically bounded error. To utilize STP approximation algorithm frameworks for APT attack detection, we propose a novel design of in-memory cache, an efficient attack screening method, and a new STP approximation algorithm that is more efficient than the conventional one in APT attack detection while maintaining the same complexity. We evaluate NodLink in a production environment. The open-world experiment shows that NodLink outperforms two state-of-the-art (SOTA) online provenance analysis systems by achieving magnitudes higher detection and investigation accuracy while having the same or higher throughput.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised rationale extraction aims to extract concise and contiguous text snippets to support model predictions without any annotated rationale. Previous studies have used a two-phase framework known as the Rationalizing Neural Prediction (RNP) framework, which follows a generate-then-predict paradigm. They assumed that the extracted explanation, called rationale, should be sufficient to predict the golden label. However, the assumption above deviates from the original definition and is too strict to perform well. Furthermore, these two-phase models suffer from the interlocking problem and spurious correlations. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel single-phase framework called You Only Forward Once (YOFO), derived from a relaxed version of rationale where rationales aim to support model predictions rather than make predictions. In our framework, A pre-trained language model like BERT is deployed to simultaneously perform prediction and rationalization with less impact from interlocking or spurious correlations. Directly choosing the important tokens in an unsupervised manner is intractable. Instead of directly choosing the important tokens, YOFO gradually removes unimportant tokens during forward propagation. Through experiments on the BeerAdvocate and Hotel Review datasets, we demonstrate that our model is able to extract rationales and make predictions more accurately compared to RNP-based models. We observe an improvement of up to 18.4\\% in token-level F1 compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. We also conducted analyses and experiments to explore the extracted rationales and token decay strategies. The results show that YOFO can extract precise and important rationales while removing unimportant tokens in the middle part of the model. ",

Our model is built on the recognized opinion formation game, where we regard each agent's opinion as a data-derived model parameter, not just a real number as in prior studies. Such an extension offers a wider understanding of opinion formation and ties closely with federated learning. Through this formulation, we characterize the sample complexity bounds for any network and also show asymptotically tight bounds for specific network structures. Intriguingly, we discover optimal strategies often allocate samples inversely to the degree, hinting at vital policy implications.

However, the exact GED computation is known to be NP-complete. For instance, the widely used A* algorithms explore the entire search space to find the optimal solution which inevitably suffers scalability issues. Learning-based methods apply graph representation techniques to learn the GED by formulating a regression task, which can not recover the edit path and lead to inaccurate GED approximation (i.e., the predicted GED is smaller than the exact). To this end, in this work, we present a data-driven hybrid approach MATA* for approximate GED computation based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and A* algorithms, which models from the perspective of learning to match nodes instead of directly regressing GED. Specifically, aware of the structure-dominant operations (i.e.,node and edge insertion/deletion) property in GED computation, a structure-enhanced GNN is firstly designed to jointly learn local and high-order structural information for node embeddings for node matchings. Second, top-k candidate nodes are produced via a differentiable top-k operation to enable the training for node matchings, which is adhering to another property of GED, i.e., multiple optimal node matchings. Third, benefiting from the candidate nodes, MATA* only performs on the promising search directions, reaching the solution efficiently. Finally, extensive experiments show the superiority of MATA* as it significantly outperforms the combinatorial search-based, learning-based and hybrid methods and scales well to large-size graphs. ",

However, the existing NMF-based methods have the following three problems: 1) they directly transform the original network into community membership space, so it is difficult for them to capture the hierarchical information; 2) they often only pay attention to the topology of the network and ignore its node attributes; 3) it is hard for them to learn the global structure information necessary for community detection. Therefore, we propose a new community detection algorithm, named Contrastive Deep Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CDNMF). Firstly, we deepen NMF to strengthen its capacity for information extraction. Subsequently, inspired by contrastive learning, our algorithm creatively constructs network topology and node attributes as two contrasting views. Furthermore, we utilize a debiased negative sampling layer and learn node similarity at the community level, thereby enhancing the suitability of our model for community detection.

Earlier research highlighted DMs' vulnerability to backdoor attacks, but these studies placed stricter requirements than conventional methods like 'BadNets' in image classification. This is because the former necessitates modifications to the diffusion sampling and training procedures. Unlike the prior work, we investigate whether generating backdoor attacks in DMs can be as simple as BadNets, i.e., by only contaminating the training dataset without tampering the original diffusion process. In this more realistic backdoor setting, we uncover bilateral backdoor effects that not only serve an adversarial purpose (compromising the functionality of DMs) but also offer a defensive advantage (which can be leveraged for backdoor defense). Specifically, we find that a BadNets-like backdoor attack remains effective in DMs for producing incorrect images (misaligned with the intended text conditions), and thereby yielding incorrect predictions when DMs are used as classifiers. Meanwhile, backdoored DMs exhibit an increased ratio of backdoor triggers, a phenomenon we refer to as `trigger amplification', among the generated images. We show that this latter insight can be used to enhance the detection of backdoor-poisoned training data. Even under a low backdoor poisoning ratio, studying the backdoor effects of DMs is also valuable for designing anti-backdoor image classifiers. Last but not least, we establish a meaningful linkage between backdoor attacks and the phenomenon of data replications by exploring DMs' inherent data memorization tendencies.

    "abstract": "Deep generative models are promising in detecting novel cyber-physical attacks, mitigating the vulnerability of Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) without relying on labeled information. Nonetheless, these generative models face challenges in identifying attack behaviors that closely resemble normal data, or deviate from the normal data distribution but are in close proximity to the manifold of the normal cluster in latent space. To tackle this problem, this article proposes a novel unsupervised dual variational generative adversarial model named MST-DVGAN, to perform anomaly detection in multivariate time series data for CPS security. The central concept is to enhance the model's discriminative capability by widening the distinction between reconstructed abnormal samples and their normal counterparts. Specifically, we propose an augmented module by imposing contrastive constraints on the reconstruction process to obtain a more compact embedding. Then, by exploiting the distribution property and modeling the normal patterns of multivariate time series, a variational autoencoder is introduced to force the generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate diverse samples. Furthermore, two augmented loss functions are designed to extract essential characteristics in a self-supervised manner through mutual guidance between the augmented samples and original samples. Finally, a specific feature center loss is introduced for the generator network to enhance its stability. Empirical experiments are conducted on three public datasets, namely SWAT, WADI and NSL_KDD. Comparing with the state-of-the-art methods, the evaluation results show that the proposed MTS-DVGAN is more stable and can achieve consistent performance improvement. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, the Deep Learning community has become interested in evolutionary optimization (EO) as a means to address hard optimization problems, e.g. meta-learning through long inner loop unrolls or optimizing non-differentiable operators. One core reason for this trend has been the recent innovation in hardware acceleration and compatible software - making distributed population evaluations much easier than before. Unlike for gradient descent-based methods though, there is a lack of hyperparameter understanding and best practices for EO - arguably due to severely less 'graduate student descent' and benchmarking being performed for EO methods. Additionally, classical benchmarks from the evolutionary community provide few practical insights for Deep Learning applications. This poses challenges for newcomers to hardware-accelerated EO and hinders significant adoption. Hence, we establish a new benchmark of EO methods (NeuroEvoBench) tailored toward Deep Learning applications and exhaustively evaluate traditional and meta-learned EO. We investigate core scientific questions including resource allocation, fitness shaping, normalization, regularization & scalability of EO.

In particular, for a graph $G$ and for each $d \\geq 1$, they consider $i_d(G)$ to be the minimum $t$ for which $G$ has such a representation. For fixed $t$ and $d$, they consider the class of $n$ vertex labeled graphs for which $i_d(G) \\leq t$, and prove an upper bound of $(2nt+\\frac{1}{2})d \\log n - (n - \\frac{1}{2})d \\log(4\\pi t)$ on the logarithm of size of the class. In this work, for fixed $t$ and $d$ we consider the class of $n$ vertex unlabeled graphs which have a {\\em $d$-dimensional $t$-representation}, denoted by $\\mathcal{G}_{t,d}$. We address the problem of designing a succinct data structure for the class $\\mathcal{G}_{t,d}$ in an attempt to generalize the relatively recent results on succinct data structures for interval graphs (Algorithmica'21). To this end, for each $n$ such that $td^2$ is in $o(n / \\log n)$, we first prove a lower bound of $(2dt-1)n \\log n - O(ndt \\log \\log n)$-bits on the size of any data structure for encoding an arbitrary graph that belongs to $\\mathcal{G}_{t,d}$. We then present a $((2dt-1)n \\log n + dt\\log t + o(ndt \\log n))$-bit data structure for $\\mathcal{G}_{t,d}$ that supports navigational queries efficiently. Contrasting this data structure with our lower bound argument, we show that for each fixed $t$ and $d$, and for all $n \\geq 0$ when $td^2$ is in $o(n/\\log n)$ our data structure for $\\mathcal{G}_{t,d}$ is succinct. As a byproduct, we also obtain succinct data structures for graphs of bounded boxicity (denoted by $d$ and $t = 1$) and graphs of bounded interval number (denoted by $t$ and $d=1$) when $td^2$ is in $o(n/\\log n)$.

Our novel two-stream architecture uses TimeSformer and EfficientNet as backbones, to effectively capture both facial and body dynamics information for efficient and accurate age estimation in videos.

The proposed method achieves superior results compared to existing face-based age estimation methods and is evaluated in situations where the face is highly occluded, blurred, or masked.

However, one-hot training labels are sparse and may lead to biased training and sub-optimal performance. Dense, soft labels have been shown to help improve recommendation performance. But how to generate high-quality and confident soft labels from noisy sequential interactions between users and items is still an open question. We propose a new learning framework for sequential recommenders, CSRec, which introduces confident soft labels to provide robust guidance when learning from user-item interactions. CSRec contains a teacher module that generates high-quality and confident soft labels and a student module that acts as the target recommender and is trained on the combination of dense, soft labels and sparse, one-hot labels. We propose and compare three approaches to constructing the teacher module: (i) model-level, (ii) data-level, and (iii) training-level. To evaluate the effectiveness and generalization ability of CSRec, we conduct experiments using various state-of-the-art sequential recommendation models as the target student module on four benchmark datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that CSRec is effective in training better performing sequential recommenders. ",

In this paper, we introduce Quantized-but-uncoded DD (QDD), where each sensor, after quantization, transmits a summarized value, instead of a codeword, to the FC. We show that QDD well adapts to the constraint of transmission power when compared to CDD, albeit with increased complexity in parameter selection. Moreover, we establish that, in the presence of independent observations, QDD upholds a necessary condition inherent in CDD. Specifically, the optimal sensor decision rules are the likelihood ratio quantizers (LRQ), irrelevant to the channel conditions. In the context of a single-sensor scenario involving binary decision at the sensor, we find that the optimal sensor rule in QDD is in general no longer ``channel blind\", a feature presented in CDD. In addition, we compare these systems numerically under the same transmission power and bandwidth, while assuming additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) in both sensing and reporting stages.

Existing methods tend to derive representative or average brain networks, assuming observed signals are generated by only a single brain activity state. However, the human brain usually involves multiple activity states, which jointly determine the brain activities. The brain regions and their connectivity usually exhibit intricate patterns that are difficult to capture with only a single-state network. Recent studies find that brain parcellation and connectivity change according to the brain activity state. We refer to such brain networks as multi-state, and this mixture can help us understand human behavior. Thus, compared to a single-state network, a multi-state network can prevent us from losing crucial information of cognitive brain network. To achieve this, we propose a new model called MNGL (Multi-state Network Graphical Lasso), which successfully models multi-state brain networks by combining CGL (coherent graphical lasso) with GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model). Using both synthetic and real world ADHD 200 fMRI datasets, we demonstrate that MNGL outperforms recent state-of-the-art alternatives by discovering more explanatory and realistic results. ",

    "abstract": "In Programming by Demonstration, the robot learns novel skills from human demonstrations. After learning, the robot should be able not only to reproduce the skill, but also to generalize it to shifted domains without collecting new training data. Adaptation to similar domains has been investigated in the literature; however, an open problem is how to adapt learned skills to different conditions that are outside of the data distribution, and, more important, how to preserve the precision of the desired adaptations. This paper presents a novel supervised learning framework called Constrained Equation Learner Networks that addresses the trajectory adaptation problem in Programming by Demonstrations from a constrained regression perspective. While conventional approaches for constrained regression use one kind of basis function, e.g., Gaussian, we exploit Equation Learner Networks to learn a set of analytical expressions and use them as basis functions. These basis functions are learned from demonstration with the objective to minimize deviations from the training data while imposing constraints that represent the desired adaptations, like new initial or final points or maintaining the trajectory within given bounds. Our approach addresses three main difficulties in adapting robotic trajectories: 1) minimizing the distortion of the trajectory for new adaptations; 2) preserving the precision of the adaptations; and 3) dealing with the lack of intuition about the structure of basis functions. We validate our approach both in simulation and in real experiments in a set of robotic tasks that require adaptation due to changes in the environment, and we compare obtained results with two existing approaches. Performed experiments show that Constrained Equation Learner Networks outperform state of the art approaches by increasing generalization and adaptability of robotic skills. ",

UQ in material property prediction poses unique challenges, including the multi-scale and multi-physics nature of advanced materials, intricate interactions between numerous factors, limited availability of large curated datasets for model training, etc. Recently, Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for UQ, offering a probabilistic framework for capturing uncertainties within neural networks. In this work, we introduce an approach for UQ within physics-informed BNNs, which integrates knowledge from governing laws in material modeling to guide the models toward physically consistent predictions. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we present case studies for predicting the creep rupture life of steel alloys. Experimental validation with three datasets of collected measurements from creep tests demonstrates the ability of BNNs to produce accurate point and uncertainty estimates that are competitive or exceed the performance of the conventional method of Gaussian Process Regression. Similarly, we evaluated the suitability of BNNs for UQ in an active learning application and reported competitive performance. The most promising framework for creep life prediction is BNNs based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo approximation of the posterior distribution of network parameters, as it provided more reliable results in comparison to BNNs based on variational inference approximation or related NNs with probabilistic outputs.

In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Agent Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning based approach that generalizes the idea of motion imitation for one character to deal with both the interaction and the motions of the multiple physics-based characters. Two unstructured datasets are given as inputs: 1) a single-actor dataset containing motions of a single actor performing a set of motions linked to a specific application, and 2) an interaction dataset containing a few examples of interactions between multiple actors. Based on these datasets, our system trains control policies allowing each character to imitate the interactive skills associated with each actor, while preserving the intrinsic style. This approach has been tested on two different fighting styles, boxing and full-body martial art, to demonstrate the ability of the method to imitate different styles. ",

It is well-established that humans exhibit extraordinary dexterity when handling objects. Such dexterity seems to derive from a robust understanding of object properties (such as weight, size, and shape), as well as a remarkable capacity to interact with them. Hand postures commonly demonstrate the influence of specific regions on objects that need to be grasped, especially when objects are partially visible. In this work, we leverage human-like object understanding by reconstructing and completing their full geometry from partial observations, and manipulating them using a 7-DoF anthropomorphic robot hand. Our approach has significantly improved the grasping success rates of baselines with only partial reconstruction by nearly 30% and achieved over 150 successful grasps with three different object categories. This demonstrates our approach's consistent ability to predict and execute grasping postures based on the completed object shapes from various directions and positions in real-world scenarios.

In this paper, we introduce TokenMotion (TMNet), which employs a transformer-based model to enhance VCOD by extracting motion-guided features using a learnable token selection. Evaluated on the challenging MoCA-Mask dataset, TMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in VCOD. It outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method by a 12.8% improvement in weighted F-measure, an 8.4% enhancement in S-measure, and a 10.7% boost in mean IoU. The results demonstrate the benefits of utilizing motion-guided features via learnable token selection within a transformer-based framework to tackle the intricate task of VCOD. ",

    "abstract": "Grounding-based vision and language models have been successfully applied to low-level vision tasks, aiming to precisely locate objects referred in captions. The effectiveness of grounding representation learning heavily relies on the scale of the training dataset. Despite being a useful data enrichment strategy, data augmentation has received minimal attention in existing vision and language tasks as augmentation for image-caption pairs is non-trivial. In this study, we propose a robust phrase grounding model trained with text-conditioned and text-unconditioned data augmentations. Specifically, we apply text-conditioned color jittering and horizontal flipping to ensure semantic consistency between images and captions. To guarantee image-caption correspondence in the training samples, we modify the captions according to pre-defined keywords when applying horizontal flipping. Additionally, inspired by recent masked signal reconstruction, we propose to use pixel-level masking as a novel form of data augmentation. While we demonstrate our data augmentation method with MDETR framework, the proposed approach is applicable to common grounding-based vision and language tasks with other frameworks. Finally, we show that image encoder pretrained on large-scale image and language datasets (such as CLIP) can further improve the results. Through extensive experiments on three commonly applied datasets: Flickr30k, referring expressions and GQA, our method demonstrates advanced performance over the state-of-the-arts with various metrics.

    "abstract": "The security issues of passive optical networks (PONs) have always been a concern due to broadcast transmission. Physical-layer security enhancement for the coherent PON should be as significant as improving transmission performance. In this paper, we propose the advanced encryption standard (AES) algorithm and geometric constellation shaping four-level pulse amplitude modulation (GCS-PAM4) pilot-based key distribution for secure coherent PON. The first bit of the GCS-PAM4 pilot is used for the hardware-efficient carrier phase recovery (CPR), while the second bit is utilized for key distribution without occupying the additional overhead. The key bits are encoded by the polar code to ensure error-free distribution. Frequent key updates are permitted for every codeword to improve the security of coherent PON. The experimental results of the 200-Gbps secure coherent PON using digital subcarrier multiplexing show that the GCS-PAM4 pilot-based key distribution could be error-free at upstream transmission without occupying the additional overhead and the eavesdropping would be prevented by AES algorithm at downstream transmission. Moreover, there is almost no performance penalty on the CPR using the GCS-PAM4 pilot compared to the binary phase shift keying pilot. ",

Our approach, named CWUTM (Topic model based on co-occurrence word networks for unbalanced short text datasets), Our approach addresses the challenge of sparse and unbalanced short text topics by mitigating the effects of incidental word co-occurrence. This allows our model to prioritize the identification of scarce topics (Low-frequency topics). Unlike previous methods, CWUTM leverages co-occurrence word networks to capture the topic distribution of each word, and we enhanced the sensitivity in identifying scarce topics by redefining the calculation of node activity and normalizing the representation of both scarce and abundant topics to some extent. Moreover, CWUTM adopts Gibbs sampling, similar to LDA, making it easily adaptable to various application scenarios. Our extensive experimental validation on unbalanced short-text datasets demonstrates the superiority of CWUTM compared to baseline approaches in discovering scarce topics. According to the experimental results the proposed model is effective in early and accurate detection of emerging topics or unexpected events on social platforms. ",

In this paper, we curate a dataset of social media content labeled with information manipulation relative to reference articles, called BanMANI. The dataset collection method we describe works around the limitations of the available NLP tools in Bangla. We expect these techniques will carry over to building similar datasets in other low-resource languages. BanMANI forms the basis both for evaluating the capabilities of existing NLP systems and for training or fine-tuning new models specifically on this task.

Existing methods often employ extracted embeddings to re-establish associations between new detections and previously disrupted tracks. However, the reliability of embeddings diminishes when the region of the occluded object frequently contains adjacent objects or clutters, especially in scenarios with severe occlusion. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel multiple object tracking method based on visual embedding consistency, mainly including: 1) Occlusion Prediction Module (OPM) and 2) Occlusion-Aware Association Module (OAAM). The OPM predicts occlusion information for each true detection, facilitating the selection of valid samples for consistency learning of the track's visual embedding. The OAAM leverages occlusion cues and visual embeddings to generate two separate embeddings for each track, guaranteeing consistency in both unoccluded and occluded detections. By integrating these two modules, our method is capable of addressing track interruptions caused by occlusion in online tracking scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves promising performance levels in both unoccluded and occluded tracking scenarios. ",

Considering that this task requires both image-/pixel-level evaluations, the proposed GPT-4V-AD framework contains three components: 1) Granular Region Division, 2) Prompt Designing, 3) Text2Segmentation for easy quantitative evaluation, and have made some different attempts for comparative analysis.

However, its performance still has a certain gap compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot method, e.g., WinCLIP ann CLIP-AD, and further research is needed.

While recent advancements in deep learning have made great strides in automated detection of building footprints, state-of-the-art methods available in existing literature often generate erroneous results for areas with densely connected buildings. Moreover, these methods do not incorporate the context of neighborhood images during training thus generally resulting in poor performance at image boundaries. In light of these gaps, we propose a novel Tuning Fork Network (TFNet) design for deep semantic segmentation that not only performs well for widely-spaced building but also has good performance for buildings that are closely packed together. The novelty of TFNet architecture lies in a a single encoder followed by two parallel decoders to separately reconstruct the building footprint and the building edge. In addition, the TFNet design is coupled with a novel methodology of incorporating neighborhood information at the tile boundaries during the training process. This methodology further improves performance, especially at the tile boundaries. For performance comparisons, we utilize the SpaceNet2 and WHU datasets, as well as a dataset from an area in Lahore, Pakistan that captures closely connected buildings. For all three datasets, the proposed methodology is found to significantly outperform benchmark methods. ",

In this work, we introduce a novel approach termed imbalanced label coupling to investigate scenarios where simple and complex features exhibit different levels of predictive power. In these cases, complex features still contribute to predictions. The trained networks make predictions in alignment with the ascending complexity of input features according to how they correlate with the label in the training set, irrespective of the underlying predictive power. For instance, even when simple spurious features distort predictions in CIFAR-10, most cats are predicted to be dogs, and most trucks are predicted to be automobiles! This observation provides direct evidence that the neural network learns core features in the presence of spurious features. We empirically show that last-layer retraining with target data distribution is effective, yet insufficient to fully recover core features when spurious features are perfectly correlated with the target labels in our synthetic dataset.

    "abstract": "The trajectory on the road traffic is commonly collected at a low sampling rate, and trajectory recovery aims to recover a complete and continuous trajectory from the sparse and discrete inputs. Recently, sequential language models have been innovatively adopted for trajectory recovery in a pre-trained manner: it learns road segment representation vectors, which will be used in the downstream tasks. However, existing methods are incapable of handling complex trajectories: when the trajectory crosses remote road segments or makes several turns, which we call critical nodes, the quality of learned representations deteriorates, and the recovered trajectories skip the critical nodes. This work is dedicated to offering a more robust trajectory recovery for complex trajectories. Firstly, we define the trajectory complexity based on the detour score and entropy score and construct the complexity-aware semantic graphs correspondingly. Then, we propose a Multi-view Graph and Complexity Aware Transformer (MGCAT) model to encode these semantics in trajectory pre-training from two aspects: 1) adaptively aggregate the multi-view graph features considering trajectory pattern, and 2) higher attention to critical nodes in a complex trajectory. Such that, our MGCAT is perceptual when handling the critical scenario of complex trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on large-scale datasets. The results prove that our method learns better representations for trajectory recovery, with 5.22% higher F1-score overall and 8.16% higher F1-score for complex trajectories particularly.

We introduce a local relationship learning module to understand local shape relationships, enhancing structural insights. Additionally, we propose a lightweight adaptive structure for refining local point features using the K nearest neighbor algorithm, addressing point cloud density differences and domain selection. Shared MLP Pooling is integrated to learn deep aggregation features, facilitating semantic data exploration and segmentation guidance.

    "abstract": "In human interactions, emotion recognition is crucial. For this reason, the topic of computer-vision approaches for automatic emotion recognition is currently being extensively researched. Processing multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) information is one of the most researched methods for automatic emotion recognition. This paper presents a new model for an affective computing-driven Quality of Experience (QoE) prediction. In order to validate the proposed model, a publicly available dataset is used. The dataset contains EEG, ECG, and respiratory data and is focused on a multimedia QoE assessment context. The EEG data are retained on which the differential entropy and the power spectral density are calculated with an observation window of three seconds. These two features were extracted to train several deep-learning models to investigate the possibility of predicting QoE with five different factors. The performance of these models is compared, and the best model is optimized to improve the results. The best results were obtained with an LSTM-based model, presenting an F1-score from 68% to 78%. An analysis of the model and its features shows that the Delta frequency band is the least necessary, that two electrodes have a higher importance, and that two other electrodes have a very low impact on the model's performances.

It is evident that the Next Generation of cellular networks(NGN) will play a pivotal role in the acceptance of emerging IoT applications supporting high data rates, better Quality of Service(QoS), and reduced latency. However, the deployment of NGN will introduce a power overhead on the communication infrastructure. Addressing the critical energy constraints in 5G and beyond, this study introduces an innovative load transfer method using drone-carried airborne base stations (BSs) for stable and secure power reallocation within a green micro-grid network. This method effectively manages energy deficit by transferring aerial BSs from high to low-energy cells, depending on user density and the availability of aerial BSs, optimizing power distribution in advanced cellular networks. The complexity of the proposed system is significantly lower as compared to existing power cable transmission systems currently employed in powering the BSs. Furthermore, our proposed algorithm has been shown to reduce BS power outages while requiring a minimum number of drone exchanges. We have conducted a thorough review on real-world dataset to prove the efficacy of our proposed approach to support BS during high load demand times ",

    "abstract": "Vehicular communication has become a reality guided by various applications. Among those, high video quality delivery with low latency constraints required by real-time applications constitutes a very challenging task. By dint of its never-before-achieved compression level, the new High-Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) is very promising for real-time video streaming through Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET). However, these networks have variable channel quality and limited bandwidth. Therefore, ensuring satisfactory video quality on such networks is a major challenge. In this work, a low complexity cross-layer mechanism is proposed to improve end-to-end performances of HEVC video streaming in VANET under low delay constraints. The idea is to assign to each packet of the transmitted video the most appropriate Access Category (AC) queue on the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer, considering the temporal prediction structure of the video encoding process, the importance of the frame and the state of the network traffic load. Simulation results demonstrate that for different targeted low-delay video communication scenarios, the proposed mechanism offers significant improvements regarding video quality at the reception and end-to-end delay compared to the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) adopted in the 802.11p. Both Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) evaluations have been also carried out to validate the proposed approach. ",

However, through a systematic study of various graph contrastive learning (GCL) methods, we observe that some common phenomena among existing GCL methods that are quite different from the original VCL methods, including 1) positive samples are not a must for GCL; 2) negative samples are not necessary for graph classification, neither for node classification when adopting specific normalization modules; 3) data augmentations have much less influence on GCL, as simple domain-agnostic augmentations (e.g., Gaussian noise) can also attain fairly good performance. By uncovering how the implicit inductive bias of GNNs works in contrastive learning, we theoretically provide insights into the above intriguing properties of GCL. Rather than directly porting existing VCL methods to GCL, we advocate for more attention toward the unique architecture of graph learning and consider its implicit influence when designing GCL methods.

To avoid the spread of false propaganda and fake news, timely detection is crucial. The damage to either modality (i.e., visual or audio) can only be discovered through multi-modal models that can exploit both pieces of information simultaneously. Previous methods mainly adopt uni-modal video forensics and use supervised pre-training for forgery detection. This study proposes a new method based on a multi-modal self-supervised-learning (SSL) feature extractor to exploit inconsistency between audio and visual modalities for multi-modal video forgery detection. We use the transformer-based SSL pre-trained Audio-Visual HuBERT (AV-HuBERT) model as a visual and acoustic feature extractor and a multi-scale temporal convolutional neural network to capture the temporal correlation between the audio and visual modalities. Since AV-HuBERT only extracts visual features from the lip region, we also adopt another transformer-based video model to exploit facial features and capture spatial and temporal artifacts caused during the deepfake generation process. Experimental results show that our model outperforms all existing models and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the FakeAVCeleb and DeepfakeTIMIT datasets. ",

We study a fully decentralised MARL setup where agents need to learn cooperation strategies and show that there is a causal relation between individual observations and the team reward.

Particularly within the context of intelligent vehicle control, RL has made impressive progress. However, currently it is still in simulated controlled environments where RL can achieve its full super-human potential. Although how to apply simulation experience in real scenarios has been studied, how to approximate simulated problems to the real dynamic problems is still a challenge. In this paper, we discuss two methods that approximate RL problems to real problems. In the context of traffic junction simulations, we demonstrate that, if we can decompose a complex task into multiple sub-tasks, solving these tasks first can be advantageous to help minimising possible occurrences of catastrophic events in the complex task. From a multi-agent perspective, we introduce a training structuring mechanism that exploits the use of experience learned under the popular paradigm called Centralised Training Decentralised Execution (CTDE). This experience can then be leveraged in fully decentralised settings that are conceptually closer to real settings, where agents often do not have access to a central oracle and must be treated as isolated independent units. The results show that the proposed approaches improve agents performance in complex tasks related to traffic junctions, minimising potential safety-critical problems that might happen in these scenarios. Although still in simulation, the investigated situations are conceptually closer to real scenarios and thus, with these results, we intend to motivate further research in the subject. ",

    "abstract": "Within (semi-)automated visual industrial inspection, learning-based approaches for assessing visual defects, including deep neural networks, enable the processing of otherwise small defect patterns in pixel size on high-resolution imagery. The emergence of these often rarely occurring defect patterns explains the general need for labeled data corpora. To alleviate this issue and advance the current state of the art in unsupervised visual inspection, this work proposes a DifferNet-based solution enhanced with attention modules: AttentDifferNet. It improves image-level detection and classification capabilities on three visual anomaly detection datasets for industrial inspection: InsPLAD-fault, MVTec AD, and Semiconductor Wafer. In comparison to the state of the art, AttentDifferNet achieves improved results, which are, in turn, highlighted throughout our quali-quantitative study. Our quantitative evaluation shows an average improvement - compared to DifferNet - of 1.77 +/- 0.25 percentage points in overall AUROC considering all three datasets, reaching SOTA results in InsPLAD-fault, an industrial inspection in-the-wild dataset. As our variants to AttentDifferNet show great prospects in the context of currently investigated approaches, a baseline is formulated, emphasizing the importance of attention for industrial anomaly detection both in the wild and in controlled environments.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent graph learning model in various graph-based tasks over the years. Nevertheless, due to the vulnerabilities of GNNs, it has been empirically proved that malicious attackers could easily corrupt the fairness level of their predictions by adding perturbations to the input graph data. In this paper, we take crucial steps to study a novel problem of certifiable defense on the fairness level of GNNs. Specifically, we propose a principled framework named ELEGANT and present a detailed theoretical certification analysis for the fairness of GNNs. ELEGANT takes any GNNs as its backbone, and the fairness level of such a backbone is theoretically impossible to be corrupted under certain perturbation budgets for attackers. Notably, ELEGANT does not have any assumption over the GNN structure or parameters, and does not require re-training the GNNs to realize certification. Hence it can serve as a plug-and-play framework for any optimized GNNs ready to be deployed. We verify the satisfactory effectiveness of ELEGANT in practice through extensive experiments on real-world datasets across different backbones of GNNs, where ELEGANT is also demonstrated to be beneficial for GNN debiasing.

Specifically, they often aim to determine whether there is a relationship between two phenomena, or to identify all causes/effects of a phenomenon. Causal questions are important for a variety of use cases, including virtual assistants and search engines. However, many current approaches to causal question answering cannot provide explanations or evidence for their answers. Hence, in this paper, we aim to answer causal questions with CauseNet, a large-scale dataset of causal relations and their provenance data. Inspired by recent, successful applications of reinforcement learning to knowledge graph tasks, such as link prediction and fact-checking, we explore the application of reinforcement learning on CauseNet for causal question answering. We introduce an Actor-Critic based agent which learns to search through the graph to answer causal questions. We bootstrap the agent with a supervised learning procedure to deal with large action spaces and sparse rewards. Our evaluation shows that the agent successfully prunes the search space to answer binary causal questions by visiting less than 30 nodes per question compared to over 3,000 nodes by a naive breadth-first search. Our ablation study indicates that our supervised learning strategy provides a strong foundation upon which our reinforcement learning agent improves. The paths returned by our agent explain the mechanisms by which a cause produces an effect. Moreover, for each edge on a path, CauseNet stores its original source on the web allowing for easy verification of paths. ",

We apply the resulting metric, called CausalCite, as a causal formulation of paper citations. We show its effectiveness on various criteria, such as high correlation with paper impact as reported by scientific experts on a previous dataset of 1K papers, (test-of-time) awards for past papers, and its stability across various sub-fields of AI.

The inability of traditional volt-VAr control in eliminating all the violations is also well-known. This paper presents a novel coordinated inverter control methodology that leverages system-wide situational awareness to significantly improve hosting capacity (HC). The methodology employs a real-time voltage-reactive power (VQ) sensitivity matrix in an iterative linear optimizer to calculate the minimum reactive power intervention from PV inverters needed for mitigating over-voltage without resorting to active power curtailing or requiring step voltage regulator setting changes. The algorithm is validated using the EPRI J1 feeder under an extensive set of realistic use cases and is shown to provide 3x improvement in HC under all scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Reliable molecular property prediction is essential for various scientific endeavors and industrial applications, such as drug discovery. However, the scarcity of data, combined with the highly non-linear causal relationships between physicochemical and biological properties and conventional molecular featurization schemes, complicates the development of robust molecular machine learning models. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a popular solution, utilizing large-scale, unannotated molecular data to learn a foundational representation of chemical space that might be advantageous for downstream tasks. Yet, existing molecular SSL methods largely overlook domain-specific knowledge, such as molecular similarity and scaffold importance, as well as the context of the target application when operating over the large chemical space. This paper introduces a novel learning framework that leverages the knowledge of structural hierarchies within molecular structures, embeds them through separate pre-training tasks over distinct channels, and employs a task-specific channel selection to compose a context-dependent representation. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance across various molecular property benchmarks and establishes some state-of-the-art results. It further offers unprecedented advantages in particularly challenging yet ubiquitous scenarios like activity cliffs with enhanced robustness and generalizability compared to other baselines. ",

SOTA techniques make use of thousands of labeled figures (finetuning transformers or training deep CNNs), acquired using labor-intensive crowdsourcing. On the other hand, self-supervised methods re-frame the HPE task as a reconstruction problem, enabling them to leverage the vast amount of unlabeled visual data, though at the present cost of accuracy. In this work, we explore ways to improve self-supervised HPE. We (1) analyze the relationship between reconstruction quality and pose estimation accuracy, (2) develop a model pipeline that outperforms the baseline which inspired our work, using less than one-third the amount of training data, and (3) offer a new metric suitable for self-supervised settings that measures the consistency of predicted body part length proportions. We show that a combination of well-engineered reconstruction losses and inductive priors can help coordinate pose learning alongside reconstruction in a self-supervised paradigm. ",

In this study, we fine-tune Wav2vec and Word2vec baseline models using two distinct data types: audio recordings and text transcripts. We experiment with four conditions: original datasets versus datasets purged of short sentences, each with and without data augmentation. Our results indicate that synonym-based text data augmentation generally enhances model performance, underscoring the importance of data volume for achieving generalizable performance. Additionally, models trained on text data frequently excel and can further improve the performance of other modalities when combined. Audio and timestamp data sometimes offer marginal improvements.

    "abstract": "Modeling and synthesizing textures are essential for enhancing the realism of virtual environments. Methods that directly synthesize textures in 3D offer distinct advantages to the UV-mapping-based methods as they can create seamless textures and align more closely with the ways textures form in nature. We propose Mesh Neural Cellular Automata (MeshNCA), a method for directly synthesizing dynamic textures on 3D meshes without requiring any UV maps. MeshNCA is a generalized type of cellular automata that can operate on a set of cells arranged on a non-grid structure such as vertices of a 3D mesh. While only being trained on an Icosphere mesh, MeshNCA shows remarkable generalization and can synthesize textures on any mesh in real time after the training. Additionally, it accommodates multi-modal supervision and can be trained using different targets such as images, text prompts, and motion vector fields. Moreover, we conceptualize a way of grafting trained MeshNCA instances, enabling texture interpolation. Our MeshNCA model enables real-time 3D texture synthesis on meshes and allows several user interactions including texture density/orientation control, a grafting brush, and motion speed/direction control. Finally, we implement the forward pass of our MeshNCA model using the WebGL shading language and showcase our trained models in an online interactive demo which is accessible on personal computers and smartphones.

Traditional appearance-based methods, such as bag-of-words models, are often limited by local 2D features and the volume of training data, making them less versatile and robust in real-world scenarios, leading to missed detections or false positives detections in loop closure. To address these issues, we first propose a object-level data association method based on multi-level verification, which can associate 2D semantic features of current frame with 3D objects landmarks of map. Next, taking advantage of these association relations, we introduce a semantic loop closure method based on quadric-level object map topology, which represents scenes through the topological graph of objects and achieves accurate loop closure at a wide field of view by comparing differences in the topological graphs. Finally, we integrate these two methods into a complete object-aware SLAM system. Qualitative experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed object-level data association algorithm. Quantitative experiments show that our semantic loop closure method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall and localization accuracy metrics. ",

Specifically, the framework consists of three components: a backbone GNN model, a propagation controller to determine the optimal propagation steps for nodes, and a weight controller to compute the priority scores for nodes. We design a mutually enhanced mechanism to compute node priority, optimal propagation step and label prediction. We also propose an alternative optimization strategy to learn the parameters in the backbone GNN model and two parametric controllers. We conduct extensive experiments to compare our framework with other 11 state-of-the-art competitors on 8 benchmark datasets.

Very often, the input graph is labeled by the user in an arbitrary and easy-to-use way, and the data structure for the graph relabels the input graph in some way. For any access, the user needs to store these labels or compute the new labels in an online manner. This might require more bits than the information-theoretic minimum of the original graph class, hence, defeating the purpose of succinctness. Given this, the data structure designer must allow the user to access the data structure with the original labels, i.e., relabeling is not allowed. We call such a graph data structure ``accessible''. In this paper, we study the complexity of such accessible data structures for interval graphs, a graph class with information-theoretic minimum less than $n\\log n$ bits. - We formalize the concept of \"accessibility\" (which was implicitly assumed), and propose the \"universal interval representation\", for interval graphs. - Any data structure for interval graphs in universal interval representation, which supports both adjacency and degree query simultaneously with time cost $t_1$ and $t_2$ respectively, must consume at least $\\log_2(n!)+n/(\\log n)^{O(t_1+t_2)}$ bits of space. This is also the first lower bound for graph classes with information-theoretic minimum less than $n\\log_2n$ bits. - We provide efficient succinct data structures for interval graphs in universal interval representation supporting adjacency query and degree query individually in constant time and space costs. Therefore, two upper bounds together with the lower bound show that the two elementary queries for interval graphs are incompatible with each other in the context of succinct data structure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proof of such incompatibility phenomenon. ",

Different types of video modalities can be used in a home setting to detect falls, including RGB, Infrared, and Thermal cameras. Anomaly detection frameworks using autoencoders and their variants can be used for fall detection due to the data imbalance that arises from the rarity and diversity of falls. However, the use of reconstruction error in autoencoders can limit the application of networks' structures that propagate information. In this paper, we propose a new multi-objective loss function called Temporal Shift, which aims to predict both future and reconstructed frames within a window of sequential frames. The proposed loss function is evaluated on a semi-naturalistic fall detection dataset containing multiple camera modalities. The autoencoders were trained on normal activities of daily living (ADL) performed by older adults and tested on ADLs and falls performed by young adults. Temporal shift shows significant improvement to a baseline 3D Convolutional autoencoder, an attention U-Net CAE, and a multi-modal neural network. The greatest improvement was observed in an attention U-Net model improving by 0.20 AUC ROC for a single camera when compared to reconstruction alone. With significant improvement across different models, this approach has the potential to be widely adopted and improve anomaly detection capabilities in other settings besides fall detection. ",

    "abstract": "In modern computational materials science, deep learning has shown the capability to predict interatomic potentials, thereby supporting and accelerating conventional simulations. However, existing models typically sacrifice either accuracy or efficiency. Moreover, lightweight models are highly demanded for offering simulating systems on a considerably larger scale at reduced computational costs. A century ago, Felix Bloch demonstrated how leveraging the equivariance of the translation operation on a crystal lattice (with geometric symmetry) could significantly reduce the computational cost of determining wavefunctions and accurately calculate material properties. Here, we introduce a lightweight equivariant interaction graph neural network (LEIGNN) that can enable accurate and efficient interatomic potential and force predictions in crystals. Rather than relying on higher-order representations, LEIGNN employs a scalar-vector dual representation to encode equivariant features. By extracting both local and global structures from vector representations and learning geometric symmetry information, our model remains lightweight while ensuring prediction accuracy and robustness through the equivariance. Our results show that LEIGNN consistently outperforms the prediction performance of the representative baselines and achieves significant efficiency across diverse datasets, which include catalysts, molecules, and organic isomers. Finally, to further validate the predicted interatomic potentials from our model, we conduct classical molecular dynamics (MD) and ab initio MD simulation across various systems, including solid, liquid, and gas. It is found that LEIGNN can achieve the accuracy of ab initio MD and retain the computational efficiency of classical MD across all examined systems, demonstrating its accuracy, efficiency, and universality.

First, considering that an individual recording point cannot reflect critical spatiotemporal local patterns, we design multi-filter convolution modules for generating informative ST-token embeddings to facilitate attention computation. Then, based on ST-token and spatial-temporal position encoding, we employ the Transformers to capture long-range temporal and spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we introduce structural entropy theory to optimize the spatial attention mechanism. Specifically, The structural entropy minimization algorithm is used to generate optimal road network hierarchies, i.e., encoding trees. Based on this, we propose a relative structural entropy-based position encoding and a multi-head attention masking scheme based on multi-layer encoding trees.

Therefore, this graph can potentially depict abnormal patterns that have emerged under the influence of brain disorders. So far, numerous studies have attempted to find embeddings for brain network graphs and subsequently classify samples with brain disorders from healthy ones, which include limitations such as: not considering the relationship between samples, not utilizing phenotype information, lack of temporal analysis, using static functional connectivity (FC) instead of dynamic ones and using a fixed graph structure. We propose a hierarchical dynamic graph representation learning (HDGL) model, which is the first model designed to address all the aforementioned challenges. HDGL consists of two levels, where at the first level, it constructs brain network graphs and learns their spatial and temporal embeddings, and at the second level, it forms population graphs and performs classification after embedding learning. Furthermore, based on how these two levels are trained, four methods have been introduced, some of which are suggested for reducing memory complexity. We evaluated the performance of the proposed model on the ABIDE and ADHD-200 datasets, and the results indicate the improvement of this model compared to several state-of-the-art models in terms of various evaluation metrics.

When the input graph topology does not fit on a single device, our method distributes the graph and use communication-avoiding SpGEMM algorithms to scale GNN minibatch sampling, enabling GNN training on much larger graphs than those that can fit into a single device memory. When the input graph topology (but not the embeddings) fits in the memory of one GPU, our approach (1) performs sampling without communication, (2) amortizes the overheads of sampling a minibatch, and (3) can represent multiple sampling algorithms by simply using different matrix constructions. In addition to new methods for sampling, we show that judiciously replicating feature data with a simple all-to-all exchange can outperform current methods for the feature extraction step in distributed GNN training.

A common approach for edge prediction is to first obtain the embeddings of two nodes, and then a predefined scoring function is used to predict the existence of an edge between the two nodes. In this paper, we introduce a new approach called E2N (Edge2Node) which directly obtains an embedding for each edge, without the need for a scoring function. To do this, we create a new graph H based on the graph G given for the edge prediction task, and then reduce the edge prediction task on G to a node classification task on H. Our E2N method can be easily applied to any edge prediction task with superior performance and lower computational costs.

In this paper, we are interested in the pilot design and signal detection when the primary transmission adopts orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). In particular, to preserve the channel orthogonality among the OFDM sub-carriers, each secondary symbol is designed to span an entire OFDM symbol. The comb-type pilot structure is employed by the primary transmission, while the preamble pilot structure is used by the secondary transmission. With the designed pilot structures, the primary signal can be detected via the conventional methods by treating the secondary signal as a part of the composite channel, i.e., the effective channel of the primary transmission. Furthermore, the secondary signal can be extracted from the estimated composite channel with the help of the detected primary signal. The bit error rate (BER) performance with both perfect and estimated CSI, the diversity orders of the primary and secondary transmissions, and the sensitivity to symbol synchronization error are analyzed. Simulation results show that the performance of the primary transmission is enhanced thanks to the backscatter link established by the secondary transmission. More importantly, even without the direct link, the primary and secondary transmissions can be supported via only the backscatter link. ",

We propose to use a CNN trained using only synthetic images to detect the LED marker as an ellipse and show that our approach is more robust than using traditional ellipse detection without requiring tuning of parameters for feature extraction. We also propose to leverage the predicted elliptical angle as a measure of uncertainty of the CNN's predictions and show how it can be used in a filter to improve marker range estimation and 3D localisation. We evaluate our system's performance through localisation of a UAV in real-world flight experiments and show that it can outperform alternative methods for localisation in GPS-denied environments. We also demonstrate our system's performance in indoor and outdoor environments. ",

    "title": "Contrastive Multi-Level Graph Neural Networks for Session-based  Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item at a certain time point based on anonymous user behavior sequences. Existing methods typically model session representation based on simple item transition information. However, since session-based data consists of limited users' short-term interactions, modeling session representation by capturing fixed item transition information from a single dimension suffers from data sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive multi-level graph neural networks (CM-GNN) to better exploit complex and high-order item transition information. Specifically, CM-GNN applies local-level graph convolutional network (L-GCN) and global-level network (G-GCN) on the current session and all the sessions respectively, to effectively capture pairwise relations over all the sessions by aggregation strategy. Meanwhile, CM-GNN applies hyper-level graph convolutional network (H-GCN) to capture high-order information among all the item transitions. CM-GNN further introduces an attention-based fusion module to learn pairwise relation-based session representation by fusing the item representations generated by L-GCN and G-GCN. CM-GNN averages the item representations obtained by H-GCN to obtain high-order relation-based session representation. Moreover, to convert the high-order item transition information into the pairwise relation-based session representation, CM-GNN maximizes the mutual information between the representations derived from the fusion module and the average pool layer by contrastive learning paradigm. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple widely used benchmark datasets to validate the efficacy of the proposed method. The encouraging results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art SBR techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, deep learning has proven to be a highly effective tool for learning meaningful features from raw data. However, it remains an open question how deep networks perform hierarchical feature learning across layers. In this work, we attempt to unveil this mystery by investigating the structures of intermediate features. Motivated by our empirical findings that linear layers mimic the roles of deep layers in nonlinear networks for feature learning, we explore how deep linear networks transform input data into output by investigating the output (i.e., features) of each layer after training in the context of multi-class classification problems. Toward this goal, we first define metrics to measure within-class compression and between-class discrimination of intermediate features, respectively. Through theoretical analysis of these two metrics, we show that the evolution of features follows a simple and quantitative pattern from shallow to deep layers when the input data is nearly orthogonal and the network weights are minimum-norm, balanced, and approximate low-rank: Each layer of the linear network progressively compresses within-class features at a geometric rate and discriminates between-class features at a linear rate with respect to the number of layers that data have passed through. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative characterization of feature evolution in hierarchical representations of deep linear networks. Empirically, our extensive experiments not only validate our theoretical results numerically but also reveal a similar pattern in deep nonlinear networks which aligns well with recent empirical studies. Moreover, we demonstrate the practical implications of our results in transfer learning. Our code is available at \\url{https://github.com/Heimine/PNC_DLN}. ",

Code, as a typical kind of formalized language, is capable of describing structural knowledge under various schemas in a universal way. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on both codes and texts have demonstrated powerful capabilities of transforming texts into codes, which provides a feasible solution to IE tasks. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a universal retrieval-augmented code generation framework based on LLMs, called Code4UIE, for IE tasks. Specifically, Code4UIE adopts Python classes to define task-specific schemas of various structural knowledge in a universal way. By so doing, extracting knowledge under these schemas can be transformed into generating codes that instantiate the predefined Python classes with the information in texts. To generate these codes more precisely, Code4UIE adopts the in-context learning mechanism to instruct LLMs with examples. In order to obtain appropriate examples for different tasks, Code4UIE explores several example retrieval strategies, which can retrieve examples semantically similar to the given texts. Extensive experiments on five representative IE tasks across nine datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the Code4UIE framework. ",

To alleviate this limitation, we propose a diffusion model-based method (DiffDose) for predicting the radiotherapy dose distribution of cancer patients. Specifically, the DiffDose model contains a forward process and a reverse process. In the forward process, DiffDose transforms dose distribution maps into pure Gaussian noise by gradually adding small noise and a noise predictor is simultaneously trained to estimate the noise added at each timestep. In the reverse process, it removes the noise from the pure Gaussian noise in multiple steps with the well-trained noise predictor and finally outputs the predicted dose distribution maps... ",

While traditional knowledge-driven models have their merits, data-driven crowd simulation models promise to bring a new dimension of realism to these simulations. However, most of the existing data-driven models are designed for specific geometries, leading to poor adaptability and applicability. A promising strategy for enhancing the adaptability and realism of data-driven crowd simulation models is to incorporate visual information, including the scenario geometry and pedestrian locomotion. Consequently, this paper proposes a novel visual-information-driven (VID) crowd simulation model. The VID model predicts the pedestrian velocity at the next time step based on the prior social-visual information and motion data of an individual. A radar-geometry-locomotion method is established to extract the visual information of pedestrians. Moreover, a temporal convolutional network (TCN)-based deep learning model, named social-visual TCN, is developed for velocity prediction. The VID model is tested on three public pedestrian motion datasets with distinct geometries, i.e., corridor, corner, and T-junction. Both qualitative and quantitative metrics are employed to evaluate the VID model, and the results highlight the improved adaptability of the model across all three geometric scenarios. Overall, the proposed method demonstrates effectiveness in enhancing the adaptability of data-driven crowd models. ",

Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) enhances model performance by optimizing it for the local worst-case scenario, but directly integrating AUC optimization with DRO results in an intractable optimization problem. To tackle this challenge, methodically we propose an instance-wise surrogate loss of Distributionally Robust AUC (DRAUC) and build our optimization framework on top of it. Moreover, we highlight that conventional DRAUC may induce label bias, hence introducing distribution-aware DRAUC as a more suitable metric for robust AUC learning. Theoretically, we affirm that the generalization gap between the training loss and testing error diminishes if the training set is sufficiently large.

A large number of valuable reviews are continually being posted, describing software problems and expected features. Effectively utilizing user reviews necessitates the extraction of relevant information, as well as their subsequent summarization. Due to the substantial volume of user reviews, manual analysis is arduous. Various approaches based on natural language processing (NLP) have been proposed for automatic user review mining. However, the majority of them requires a manually crafted dataset to train their models, which limits their usage in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose Mini-BAR, a tool that integrates large language models (LLMs) to perform zero-shot mining of user reviews in both English and French. Specifically, Mini-BAR is designed to (i) classify the user reviews, (ii) cluster similar reviews together, (iii) generate an abstractive summary for each cluster and (iv) rank the user review clusters. To evaluate the performance of Mini-BAR, we created a dataset containing 6,000 English and 6,000 French annotated user reviews and conducted extensive experiments. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Mini-BAR in requirement engineering by analyzing bilingual app reviews.

Despite recent progress in the area, it remains an open problem. FcaNet, the current state-of-the-art channel attention mechanism, attempted to find such an information-rich compression using Discrete Cosine Transforms (DCTs). One drawback of FcaNet is that there is no natural choice of the DCT frequencies. To circumvent this issue, FcaNet experimented on ImageNet to find optimal frequencies. We hypothesize that the choice of frequency plays only a supporting role and the primary driving force for the effectiveness of their attention filters is the orthogonality of the DCT kernels. To test this hypothesis, we construct an attention mechanism using randomly initialized orthogonal filters. Integrating this mechanism into ResNet, we create OrthoNet. We compare OrthoNet to FcaNet (and other attention mechanisms) on Birds, MS-COCO, and Places356 and show superior performance. On the ImageNet dataset, our method competes with or surpasses the current state-of-the-art. Our results imply that an optimal choice of filter is elusive and generalization can be achieved with a sufficiently large number of orthogonal filters. We further investigate other general principles for implementing channel attention, such as its position in the network and channel groupings. ",

One novelty in this work is the combination of remote sensing data with environmental parameters of the experimental sites for disease severity prediction. Although the model is evaluated on this special use case, it is held as generic as possible to also be applicable to various image-based classification and regression tasks.

However, such capabilities are prone to potential abuse, such as fake news generation, spam email creation, and misuse in academic assignments. Hence, it is essential to build automated approaches capable of distinguishing between artificially generated text and human-authored text. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient solution to this problem by ensembling predictions from multiple constituent LLMs. Compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches, which are perplexity-based or uses ensembles with a number of LLMs, our condensed ensembling approach uses only two constituent LLMs to achieve comparable performance. Experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets for generative text classification show performance improvements in the range of 0.5 to 100\\% compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches. We also study the influence the training data from individual LLMs have on model performance. We found that substituting commercially-restrictive Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) data with data generated from other open language models such as Falcon, Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA2), and Mosaic Pretrained Transformers (MPT) is a feasible alternative when developing generative text detectors. Furthermore, to demonstrate zero-shot generalization, we experimented with an English essays dataset, and results suggest that our ensembling approach can handle new data effectively. ",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised pre-training has shown great success in skeleton-based action understanding recently. Existing works typically train separate modality-specific models, then integrate the multi-modal information for action understanding by a late-fusion strategy. Although these approaches have achieved significant performance, they suffer from the complex yet redundant multi-stream model designs, each of which is also limited to the fixed input skeleton modality. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, we propose a Unified Multimodal Unsupervised Representation Learning framework, called UmURL, which exploits an efficient early-fusion strategy to jointly encode the multi-modal features in a single-stream manner. Specifically, instead of designing separate modality-specific optimization processes for uni-modal unsupervised learning, we feed different modality inputs into the same stream with an early-fusion strategy to learn their multi-modal features for reducing model complexity. To ensure that the fused multi-modal features do not exhibit modality bias, i.e., being dominated by a certain modality input, we further propose both intra- and inter-modal consistency learning to guarantee that the multi-modal features contain the complete semantics of each modal via feature decomposition and distinct alignment. In this manner, our framework is able to learn the unified representations of uni-modal or multi-modal skeleton input, which is flexible to different kinds of modality input for robust action understanding in practical cases. Extensive experiments conducted on three large-scale datasets, i.e., NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD II, demonstrate that UmURL is highly efficient, possessing the approximate complexity with the uni-modal methods, while achieving new state-of-the-art performance across various downstream task scenarios in skeleton-based action representation learning.

In this work, we focus on the use-case last-mile delivery, where only a single RGB image is taken and compared against a reference from an existing database to detect potential appearance changes that indicate tampering. We propose a tampering detection pipeline that utilizes keypoint detection to identify the eight corner points of a parcel. This permits applying a perspective transformation to create normalized fronto-parallel views for each visible parcel side surface. These viewpoint-invariant parcel side surface representations facilitate the identification of signs of tampering on parcels within the supply chain, since they reduce the problem to parcel side surface matching with pair-wise appearance change detection. Experiments with multiple classical and deep learning-based change detection approaches are performed on our newly collected TAMpering detection dataset for PARcels, called TAMPAR.

Our evaluation shows promising results for keypoint (Keypoint AP 75.76) and tampering detection (81% accuracy, F1-Score 0.83) on real images.

    "title": "A Brain-inspired Theory of Collective Mind Model for Efficient Social  Cooperation",
    "abstract": "Social intelligence manifests the capability, often referred to as the Theory of Mind (ToM), to discern others' behavioral intentions, beliefs, and other mental states. ToM is especially important in multi-agent and human-machine interaction environments because each agent needs to understand the mental states of other agents in order to better respond, interact, and collaborate. Recent research indicates that the ToM model possesses the capability to infer beliefs, intentions, and anticipate future observations and actions; nonetheless, its deployment in tackling intricate tasks remains notably limited. The challenges arise when the number of agents increases, the environment becomes more complex, and interacting with the environment and predicting the mental state of each other becomes difficult and time consuming. To overcome such limits, we take inspiration from the Theory of Collective Mind (ToCM) mechanism, predicting observations of all other agents into a unified but plural representation and discerning how our own actions affect this mental state representation. Based on this foundation, we construct an imaginative space to simulate the multi-agent interaction process, thus improving the efficiency of cooperation among multiple agents in complex decision-making environments. In various cooperative tasks with different numbers of agents, the experimental results highlight the superior cooperative efficiency and performance of our approach compared to the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) baselines. We achieve consistent boost on SNN- and DNN-based decision networks, and demonstrate that ToCM's inferences about others' mental states can be transferred to new tasks for quickly and flexible adaptation.

In contrast to that of PFL, the convergence theory of SFL on heterogeneous data is still lacking. In this paper, we establish the convergence guarantees of SFL for strongly/general/non-convex objectives on heterogeneous data. The convergence guarantees of SFL are better than that of PFL on heterogeneous data with both full and partial client participation. Experimental results validate the counterintuitive analysis result that SFL outperforms PFL on extremely heterogeneous data in cross-device settings. ",

    "abstract": "The alleged threat of reconstruction attacks has led the U.S. Census Bureau (USCB) to replace in the Decennial Census 2020 the traditional statistical disclosure limitation based on rank swapping with one based on differential privacy (DP). This has resulted in substantial accuracy loss of the released statistics. Worse yet, it has been shown that the reconstruction attacks used as an argument to move to DP are very far from allowing unequivocal reidentification of the respondents, because in general there are a lot of reconstructions compatible with the released statistics. In a very recent paper, a new reconstruction attack has been proposed, whose goal is to indicate the confidence that a reconstructed record was in the original respondent data. The alleged risk of serious disclosure entailed by such confidence-ranked reconstruction has renewed the interest of the USCB to use DP-based solutions. To forestall the potential accuracy loss in future data releases resulting from adoption of these solutions, we show in this paper that the proposed confidence-ranked reconstruction does not threaten privacy. Specifically, we report empirical results showing that the proposed ranking cannot guide reidentification or attribute disclosure attacks, and hence it fails to warrant the USCB's move towards DP. Further, we also demonstrate that, due to the way the Census data are compiled, processed and released, it is not possible to reconstruct original and complete records through any methodology, and the confidence-ranked reconstruction not only is completely ineffective at accurately reconstructing Census records but is trivially outperformed by an adequate interpretation of the released aggregate statistics.

    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been widely used for generating synthetic data for cases where there is a limited size real-world dataset or when data holders are unwilling to share their data samples. Recent works showed that GANs, due to overfitting and memorization, might leak information regarding their training data samples. This makes GANs vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). Several defense strategies have been proposed in the literature to mitigate this privacy issue. Unfortunately, defense strategies based on differential privacy are proven to reduce extensively the quality of the synthetic data points. On the other hand, more recent frameworks such as PrivGAN and PAR-GAN are not suitable for small-size training datasets. In the present work, the overfitting in GANs is studied in terms of the discriminator, and a more general measure of overfitting based on the Bhattacharyya coefficient is defined. Then, inspired by Fano's inequality, our first defense mechanism against MIAs is proposed. This framework, which requires only a simple modification in the loss function of GANs, is referred to as the maximum entropy GAN or MEGAN and significantly improves the robustness of GANs to MIAs. As a second defense strategy, a more heuristic model based on minimizing the information leaked from generated samples about the training data points is presented. This approach is referred to as mutual information minimization GAN (MIMGAN) and uses a variational representation of the mutual information to minimize the information that a synthetic sample might leak about the whole training data set. Applying the proposed frameworks to some commonly used data sets against state-of-the-art MIAs reveals that the proposed methods can reduce the accuracy of the adversaries to the level of random guessing accuracy with a small reduction in the quality of the synthetic data samples.

To obtain this result, we provide a more general algorithm that solves what we call the incremental, thresholded $p$-norm flow problem that asks to determine the first edge-insertion in an undirected graph that causes the minimum $\\ell_p$-norm flow to decrease below a given threshold in value. Since we solve this thresholded problem, our data structure succeeds against an adaptive adversary that can only see the data structure's output. Furthermore, since our algorithm holds for $p = 2$, we obtain improved algorithms for dynamically maintaining the effective resistance between a pair of vertices in an undirected graph undergoing edge insertions. Our algorithm builds upon previous dynamic algorithms for approximately solving the minimum-ratio cycle problem that underlie previous advances on the maximum flow problem [Chen-Kyng-Liu-Peng-Probst Gutenberg-Sachdeva, FOCS '22] as well as recent dynamic maximum flow algorithms [v.d.Brand-Liu-Sidford, STOC '23]. Instead of using interior point methods, which were a key component of these recent advances, our algorithm uses an optimization method based on $\\ell_p$-norm iterative refinement and the multiplicative weight update method. This ensures a monotonicity property in the minimum-ratio cycle subproblems that allows us to apply known data structures and bypass issues arising from adaptive queries. ",

We conduct simulation-based experiments and find that minimizing the Euclidean-Norm of the total residual load at transformer sub-stations is an effective objective for harnessing DR for dispatching highly renewable grids. We show that this control objective can be effectively achieved without optimal power flow calculations or knowledge about the topology of a grid. Additionally, we find that pursuing this objective reduces the sum of peak power flows along all lines in an active distribution network and therefore provides not only smaller voltage deviations, but also lower transmission losses.

In real-world applications, as a data-driven model, DNNs are suffered from insufficient data. Few-shot learning has been studied to deal with this limitation. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot learning framework through data augmentation, which involves transformation through the time-frequency domain and the generation of synthetic images through random erasing. Additionally, we develop a sequence-spectrogram neural network (SSNN). This neural network model composes of two sub-networks: one utilizing 1D residual blocks to extract features from the input sequence while the other one employing 2D residual blocks to extract features from the spectrogram representation. In the experiments, comparison studies of different existing DNN models with/without data augmentation are conducted on an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) dataset and a wind turbine fault (WTF) dataset. The experimental results manifest that our proposed method achieves 93.75% F1 score and 93.33% accuracy on the ALS datasets while 95.48% F1 score and 95.59% accuracy on the WTF datasets.

Sensor fusion is considered an effective method to overcome the weaknesses of individual sensors. In recent years, multimodal place recognition fusing information from multiple sensors has gathered increasing attention. However, most existing multimodal place recognition methods only use limited field-of-view camera images, which leads to an imbalance between features from different modalities and limits the effectiveness of sensor fusion. In this paper, we present a novel neural network named LCPR for robust multimodal place recognition, which fuses LiDAR point clouds with multi-view RGB images to generate discriminative and yaw-rotation invariant representations of the environment. A multi-scale attention-based fusion module is proposed to fully exploit the panoramic views from different modalities of the environment and their correlations. We evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset, and the experimental results show that our method can effectively utilize multi-view camera and LiDAR data to improve the place recognition performance while maintaining strong robustness to viewpoint changes.

Interference and the inherent randomness of the wireless channel further complicate the issue, posing additional challenges for repeatable and consistent testing. Consequently, both private and public cellular systems still rely heavily on human intervention for operations such as network reconfiguration, performance monitoring, and conducting end-to-end drive tests. This reliance significantly slows the pace of innovation in cellular systems. To address these challenges, we introduce 5G-CT, an automation framework based on OpenShift and the GitOps workflow, capable of deploying a softwarized end-to-end 5G and O-RAN-compliant system in a matter of seconds. We have deployed 5G-CT to test the integration and performance of popular open-source cellular stacks, including OpenAirInterface (OAI), and have collected months of over-the-air testing results without the need for human intervention. 5G-CT brings cloud-native Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) to the RAN, effectively addressing the complexities associated with managing spectrum, radios, heterogeneous devices, and distributed components. Moreover, it provides much-needed automation and Continuous Testing (CT) for cellular networks. ",

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection discerns OOD data where the predictor cannot make valid predictions as in-distribution (ID) data, thereby increasing the reliability of open-world classification. However, it is typically hard to collect real out-of-distribution (OOD) data for training a predictor capable of discerning ID and OOD patterns. This obstacle gives rise to data generation-based learning methods, synthesizing OOD data via data generators for predictor training without requiring any real OOD data. Related methods typically pre-train a generator on ID data and adopt various selection procedures to find those data likely to be the OOD cases. However, generated data may still coincide with ID semantics, i.e., mistaken OOD generation remains, confusing the predictor between ID and OOD data. To this end, we suggest that generated data (with mistaken OOD generation) can be used to devise an auxiliary OOD detection task to facilitate real OOD detection. Specifically, we can ensure that learning from such an auxiliary task is beneficial if the ID and the OOD parts have disjoint supports, with the help of a well-designed training procedure for the predictor. Accordingly, we propose a powerful data generation-based learning method named Auxiliary Task-based OOD Learning (ATOL) that can relieve the mistaken OOD generation. We conduct extensive experiments under various OOD detection setups, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method against its advanced counterparts. ",

Under the view of coupled oscillators, we first show the connection between Kuramoto model and basic GNN and then over-smoothing phenomenon in GNNs can be interpreted as phase synchronization in Kuramoto model. The KuramotoGNN replaces this phase synchronization with frequency synchronization to prevent the node features from converging into each other while allowing the system to reach a stable synchronized state.

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have recently shown impressive capability in modeling heterogeneous graphs that are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Due to the diversity of attributes of nodes in different types, most existing models first align nodes by mapping them into the same low-dimensional space. However, in this way, they lose the type information of nodes. In addition, most of them only consider the interactions between nodes while neglecting the high-order information behind the latent interactions among different node features. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph model MULAN, including two major components, i.e., a type-aware encoder and a dimension-aware encoder. Specifically, the type-aware encoder compensates for the loss of node type information and better leverages graph heterogeneity in learning node representations. Built upon transformer architecture, the dimension-aware encoder is capable of capturing the latent interactions among the diverse node features. With these components, the information of graph heterogeneity, node features and graph structure can be comprehensively encoded in node representations. We conduct extensive experiments on six heterogeneous benchmark datasets, which demonstrates the superiority of MULAN over other state-of-the-art competitors and also shows that MULAN is efficient.

    "abstract": "This article delves into advancements in resource allocation techniques tailored for systems utilizing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), with a primary focus on achieving low-complexity and resilient solutions. The investigation of low-complexity approaches for RIS holds significant relevance, primarily owing to the intricate characteristics inherent in RIS-based systems and the need of deploying large-scale RIS arrays. Concurrently, the exploration of robust solutions aims to address the issue of hardware impairments occurring at both the transceivers and RIS components in practical RIS-assisted systems. In the realm of both low-complexity and robust resource allocation, this article not only elucidates the fundamental techniques underpinning these methodologies but also offers comprehensive numerical results for illustrative purposes. The necessity of adopting resource allocation strategies that are both low in complexity and resilient is thoroughly established. Ultimately, this article provides prospective research avenues in the domain of low-complexity and robust resource allocation techniques tailored for RIS-assisted systems. ",

In this work, we consider a class of time series with three common bad properties, including sampling irregularities, missingness, and large feature-temporal dimensions, and introduce a general model, TS-Diffusion, to process such complex time series. Our model consists of three parts under the framework of point process. The first part is an encoder of the neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) that converts time series into dense representations, with the jump technique to capture sampling irregularities and self-attention mechanism to handle missing values; The second component of TS-Diffusion is a diffusion model that learns from the representation of time series. These time-series representations can have a complex distribution because of their high dimensions; The third part is a decoder of another ODE that generates time series with irregularities and missing values given their representations. We have conducted extensive experiments on multiple time-series datasets, demonstrating that TS-Diffusion achieves excellent results on both conventional and complex time series and significantly outperforms previous baselines.

    "abstract": "Discovering the underlying relationships among variables from temporal observations has been a longstanding challenge in numerous scientific disciplines, including biology, finance, and climate science. The dynamics of such systems are often best described using continuous-time stochastic processes. Unfortunately, most existing structure learning approaches assume that the underlying process evolves in discrete-time and/or observations occur at regular time intervals. These mismatched assumptions can often lead to incorrect learned structures and models. In this work, we introduce a novel structure learning method, SCOTCH, which combines neural stochastic differential equations (SDE) with variational inference to infer a posterior distribution over possible structures. This continuous-time approach can naturally handle both learning from and predicting observations at arbitrary time points. Theoretically, we establish sufficient conditions for an SDE and SCOTCH to be structurally identifiable, and prove its consistency under infinite data limits. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach leads to improved structure learning performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets compared to relevant baselines under regular and irregular sampling intervals.

    "abstract": "Localised data aggregation in many countries including Great Britain (GB) is typically done to a geographical level with polygon boundaries that have a robust and trusted governance system in place. At a minimum this will mean there is confidence in a process to create a set of polygons that have unique identifiers coupled to geographical areas, and the ability to have these updated through a defined code of practice. Examples found across many countries are in the delivery of post, such as postcodes and zip codes, and of the definition of census areas and municipal boundaries. The confidence in these boundaries allows different data to be aggregated by third parties, which itself provides greater levels of data over comparable geographical areas to enhance wider analysis and decision making. Here we combine publicly available datasets published from the six regional electricity Distribution Network Operators of GB to produce a new geospatial dataset with 4436 unique polygons defining the areas served by electrical primary substations. An example is also presented of the use of these polygons to link postcode level open government datasets on domestic energy consumption (2015-2020) from the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). This results in another dataset with energy statistics aggregated to the geographical areas served by each primary substation across Great Britain. Therefore, we believe there is a compelling argument for countries to set up processes to create and update polygons that have a meaningful relationship to energy systems. This would allow more accurate energy systems analysis to be performed, ultimately leading to an accelerated or potentially lower cost transition to a net-zero world. ",

In particular, we consider a multi-task learning scheme where multiple predicates defined on a set of objects are to be jointly learned from examples, enforcing a set of FOL constraints on the admissible configurations of their values. The predicates are defined on the feature spaces, in which the input objects are represented, and can be either known a priori or approximated by an appropriate kernel-based learner. A general approach is presented to convert the FOL clauses into a continuous implementation that can deal with the outputs computed by the kernel-based predicates. The learning problem is formulated as a semi-supervised task that requires the optimization in the primal of a loss function that combines a fitting loss measure on the supervised examples, a regularization term, and a penalty term that enforces the constraints on both the supervised and unsupervised examples. Unfortunately, the penalty term is not convex and it can hinder the optimization process. However, it is possible to avoid poor solutions by using a two stage learning schema, in which the supervised examples are learned first and then the constraints are enforced. ",

Recent work has considered Bayesian optimization of function networks (BOFN), where the objective function is computed via a network of functions, each taking as input the output of previous nodes in the network and additional parameters. Exploiting this network structure has been shown to yield significant performance improvements. Existing BOFN algorithms for general-purpose networks are required to evaluate the full network at each iteration. However, many real-world applications allow evaluating nodes individually. To take advantage of this opportunity, we propose a novel knowledge gradient acquisition function for BOFN that chooses which node to evaluate as well as the inputs for that node in a cost-aware fashion. This approach can dramatically reduce query costs by allowing the evaluation of part of the network at a lower cost relative to evaluating the entire network. We provide an efficient approach to optimizing our acquisition function and show it outperforms existing BOFN methods and other benchmarks across several synthetic and real-world problems. Our acquisition function is the first to enable cost-aware optimization of a broad class of function networks. ",

    "abstract": "We present and analyze an actively controlled Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (actSIS) model of interconnected populations to study how risk aversion strategies, such as social distancing, affect network epidemics. A population using a risk aversion strategy reduces its contact rate with other populations when it perceives an increase in infection risk. The network actSIS model relies on two distinct networks. One is a physical contact network that defines which populations come into contact with which other populations and thus how infection spreads. The other is a communication network, such as an online social network, that defines which populations observe the infection level of which other populations and thus how information spreads. We prove that the model, with these two networks and populations using risk aversion strategies, exhibits a transcritical bifurcation in which an endemic equilibrium emerges. For regular graphs, we prove that the endemic infection level is uniform across populations and reduced by the risk aversion strategy, relative to the network SIS endemic level. We show that when communication is sufficiently sparse, this initially stable equilibrium loses stability in a secondary bifurcation. Simulations show that a new stable solution emerges with nonuniform infection levels. ",

It is well known that the optimal measurement under both the error-probability and log-loss criteria is a projection, while under an ``erasure-distortion'' criterion it is a three-outcome positive operator-valued measure (POVM). These results were derived separately. We present a unified approach which finds the optimal measurement under any distortion measure that satisfies a convexity relation with respect to the Bhattacharyya distance. Namely, whenever the measure is relatively convex (resp. concave), the measurement is the projection (resp. three-outcome POVM) above. The three above-mentioned results are obtained as special cases of this simple derivation. As for further measures for which our result applies, we prove that Renyi entropies of order $1$ and above (resp. $1/2$ and below) are relatively convex (resp. concave). A special setting of great practical interest, is the discrimination between two coherent-light waveforms. In a remarkable work by Dolinar it was shown that a simple detector consisting of a photon counter and a feedback-controlled local oscillator obtains the quantum-optimal error probability. Later it was shown that the same detector (with the same local signal) is also optimal in the log-loss sense. By applying a similar convexity approach, we obtain in a unified manner the optimal signal for a variety of criteria. ",

Unfortunately, ignoring interference may lead to biased policy evaluation and yield ineffective learned policies. For example, treating influential individuals who have many friends can generate positive spillover effects, thereby improving the overall performance of an individualized treatment rule (ITR). We consider the problem of evaluating and learning an optimal ITR under clustered network (or partial) interference where clusters of units are sampled from a population and units may influence one another within each cluster. Under this model, we propose an estimator that can be used to evaluate the empirical performance of an ITR. We show that this estimator is substantially more efficient than the standard inverse probability weighting estimator, which does not impose any assumption about spillover effects. We derive the finite-sample regret bound for a learned ITR, showing that the use of our efficient evaluation estimator leads to the improved performance of learned policies. Finally, we conduct simulation and empirical studies to illustrate the advantages of the proposed methodology. ",

It consists of two cyclically connected CGANs of 47 layers each; where both generators (each of 32 layers) are conditioned with concatenation of alternate unpaired patches from input and target modality images (not ground truth) of the same organ. The key idea is to exploit cross-neighborhood contextual feature information that bounds the translation space and boosts generalization. The generators are further equipped with adaptive dictionaries learned from the contextual patches to reduce possible degradation. Discriminators are 15-layer deep networks that employ minimax function to validate the translated imagery. A combined loss function is formulated with adversarial, non-adversarial, forward-backward cyclic, and identity losses that further minimize the variance of the proposed learning machine.

The focus of this work is to provide left atrial visualization early in the procedure to ease procedure complexity and enable further workflows, such as using catheters that have difficulty sampling the surface. We propose a dense encoder-decoder network with a novel regularization term to reconstruct the shape of the left atrium from partial data which is derived from simple catheter maneuvers. To train the network, we acquire a large dataset of 3D atria shapes and generate corresponding catheter trajectories. Once trained, we show that the suggested network can sufficiently approximate the atrium shape based on a given trajectory. We compare several network solutions for the 3D atrium reconstruction. We demonstrate that the solution proposed produces realistic visualization using partial acquisition within a 3-minute time interval. Synthetic and human clinical cases are shown. ",

Comprehensive evaluations on a diverse array of datasets validate scBeacon's superiority over existing single-cell differential gene analysis tools.

    "abstract": "In the vast expanse of online communication, identifying unilateral preference patterns can be pivotal in understanding and mitigating risks such as predatory behavior. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to dissect and visualize such patterns in social networks. Through the lens of a directed network model, we simulate a scenario where a predominant cluster 'A' disperses information unilaterally towards a much larger, but passive, cluster 'B', while being overseen by a vigilant cluster 'C', restricted by an information blocking cluster 'D', and countered by an alerting cluster 'E'. Incorporated into this study is a simulation framework that models the flow of information across a directed network comprising various clusters with distinct roles and communication behaviors. The simulation employs a dynamic system where clusters 'A' through 'E' interact over a series of time steps, with each cluster's activity shaped by both intrinsic message-generation rules and external media influences. By tracking the accumulated media influence on each cluster, we gain a nuanced understanding of the long-term effects of media on communication patterns. The results provide a window into the cyclical nature of influence and the propagation of information, with potential applications in detecting and mitigating unilateral communication patterns that could signal harmful activities such as online predation. This study, therefore, presents a comprehensive approach that combines network theory, simulation modeling, and dynamic media influence analysis to explore and understand the complexities of unilateral preference communication within social networks.

    "abstract": "The task of inferring high-level causal variables from low-level observations, commonly referred to as causal representation learning, is fundamentally underconstrained. As such, recent works to address this problem focus on various assumptions that lead to identifiability of the underlying latent causal variables. A large corpus of these preceding approaches consider multi-environment data collected under different interventions on the causal model. What is common to virtually all of these works is the restrictive assumption that in each environment, only a single variable is intervened on. In this work, we relax this assumption and provide the first identifiability result for causal representation learning that allows for multiple variables to be targeted by an intervention within one environment. Our approach hinges on a general assumption on the coverage and diversity of interventions across environments, which also includes the shared assumption of single-node interventions of previous works. The main idea behind our approach is to exploit the trace that interventions leave on the variance of the ground truth causal variables and regularizing for a specific notion of sparsity with respect to this trace. In addition to and inspired by our theoretical contributions, we present a practical algorithm to learn causal representations from multi-node interventional data and provide empirical evidence that validates our identifiability results.

    "abstract": "Graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) operates on graph domain and it has achieved a superior performance to accomplish a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a Barron space of functions on a compact domain of graph signals. We prove that the proposed Barron space is a reproducing kernel Banach space, it can be decomposed into the union of a family of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces with neuron kernels, and it could be dense in the space of continuous functions on the domain. Approximation property is one of the main principles to design neural networks. In this paper, we show that outputs of GCNNs are contained in the Barron space and functions in the Barron space can be well approximated by outputs of some GCNNs in the integrated square and uniform measurements. We also estimate the Rademacher complexity of functions with bounded Barron norm and conclude that functions in the Barron space could be learnt from their random samples efficiently. ",

We apply our method to learning subject-specific atlases and motion stabilization of dynamic BOLD MRI time-series of fetuses in utero. Our method yields high-quality atlases of fetal BOLD time-series with $\\sim$5-7$\\times$ faster convergence compared to existing work. While our method slightly underperforms well-tuned baselines in terms of anatomical overlap, it estimates templates significantly faster, thus enabling rapid processing and stabilization of large databases of 4D dynamic MRI acquisitions.

We use discretized semantic tokens acquired from wav2vec2.0 embeddings, which makes it easy to adopt a neural transducer for the TTS framework enjoying its monotonic alignment constraints. The proposed model first generates aligned semantic tokens using the neural transducer, then synthesizes a speech sample from the semantic tokens using a non-autoregressive(NAR) speech generator. This decoupled framework alleviates the training complexity of TTS and allows each stage to focus on 1) linguistic and alignment modeling and 2) fine-grained acoustic modeling, respectively. Experimental results on the zero-shot adaptive TTS show that the proposed model exceeds the baselines in speech quality and speaker similarity via objective and subjective measures. We also investigate the inference speed and prosody controllability of our proposed model, showing the potential of the neural transducer for TTS frameworks. ",

We introduced a duplication-split model of network growth characterized by (i) identical power law distributions of in-degrees and out-degrees $p_k\\sim k^{-1/q}$ and (ii) a fractal scaling of the longest path length $L$ with the network size $N$, $L\\sim N^{1-\\alpha}$ with $0<\\alpha<q$. Here I provide convincing evidence that the duplication-split model generates fractal networks. The average distance between nodes scales as $\\langle d\\rangle \\sim d^{\\beta}$ with $0<\\beta<1$. The average number of nodes $M_d$ within a distance $d$ scales as $M_d\\sim d^{d_f}$, with a fractal dimension $d_f=1/\\beta>1$. Furthermore, the duplication-split networks are fragile for duplication rates $q<q_c=1/2$: The size of the giant out-component decreases with increasing the network size for any site occupancy probability less than 1. In contrast, they exhibit a non trivial percolation threshold $0<p_c<1$ for $q>q_c$, in spite the mean out-degree diverges with increasing the network size. I conclude the project networks generated by the duplication-split model are manageable for $q<q_c$ and unmanageable otherwise. ",

Our methods provide robust quantum attacks to well-known cryptographic algorithms, more efficiently and with remarkably fewer qubits than previous approaches. We implement simulations of our attacks for symmetric-key protocols such as S-DES, S-AES and Blowfish. For instance, we show how our attack allows a classical simulation of a small 8-qubit quantum computer to find the secret key of one 32-bit Blowfish instance with 24 times fewer number of iterations than a brute-force attack. Our work also shows improvements in attack success rates for lightweight ciphers such as S-DES and S-AES. Further applications beyond symmetric-key cryptography are also discussed, including asymmetric-key protocols and hash functions. In addition, we also comment on potential future improvements of our methods. Our results bring one step closer assessing the vulnerability of large-size classical cryptographic protocols with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and set the stage for future research in quantum cybersecurity.

Most UAVs are equipped with sensors that have bounded coverage and wireless communication equipment with limited range. Such limitations pose challenging problems to monitor mobile targets. This paper examines fulfilling surveillance objectives to achieve better coverage while building a resilient network between UAVs with an extended lifetime. The multiple target tracking problem is studied by including a relay UAV within the fleet whose trajectory is autonomously calculated in order to achieve a reliable connected network among all UAVs. Optimization problems are formulated for single-hop and multi-hop communications among UAVs. Three heuristic algorithms are proposed for multi-hop communications and their performances are evaluated. A hybrid algorithm, which dynamically switches between single-hop and multi-hop communications is also proposed. The effect of the time horizon considered in the optimization problem is studied. Performance evaluation results show that the trajectories generated for the relay UAV by the hybrid algorithm can achieve network lifetimes that are within 5% of the maximum possible network lifetime which can be obtained if the entire trajectories of all targets were known a priori.

    "abstract": "Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors is critical for medical diagnosis. However, current supervised learning methods require extensively annotated images and the state-of-the-art generative models used in unsupervised methods often have limitations in covering the whole data distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel framework Two-Stage Generative Model (TSGM) that combines Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) and Variance Exploding stochastic differential equation using joint probability (VE-JP) to improve brain tumor detection and segmentation. The CycleGAN is trained on unpaired data to generate abnormal images from healthy images as data prior. Then VE-JP is implemented to reconstruct healthy images using synthetic paired abnormal images as a guide, which alters only pathological regions but not regions of healthy. Notably, our method directly learned the joint probability distribution for conditional generation. The residual between input and reconstructed images suggests the abnormalities and a thresholding method is subsequently applied to obtain segmentation results. Furthermore, the multimodal results are weighted with different weights to improve the segmentation accuracy further. We validated our method on three datasets, and compared with other unsupervised methods for anomaly detection and segmentation. The DSC score of 0.8590 in BraTs2020 dataset, 0.6226 in ITCS dataset and 0.7403 in In-house dataset show that our method achieves better segmentation performance and has better generalization. ",

We assessed the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning models for thermal conductivity prediction on this expanded dataset and observed that all these models suffered from overfitting. To address this issue, we introduced a novel graph-based neural network model, which demonstrated more consistent and regularized performance across all evaluated datasets. Nevertheless, the best mean absolute percentage error achieved on the test dataset remained in the range of 50-60%. This suggests that while these models are valuable for expediting material screening, their current accuracy is still limited. ",

    "abstract": "While model architectures and training strategies have become more generic and flexible with respect to different data modalities over the past years, a persistent limitation lies in the assumption of fixed quantities and arrangements of input features. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in scenarios where the attributes captured during data acquisition vary across different samples. In this work, we aim at effectively leveraging data with varying features, without the need to constrain the input space to the intersection of potential feature sets or to expand it to their union. We propose a novel architecture that can directly process data without the necessity of aligned feature modalities by learning a general embedding space that captures the relationship between features across data samples with varying sets of features. This is achieved via a set-transformer architecture augmented by feature-encoder layers, thereby enabling the learning of a shared latent feature space from data originating from heterogeneous feature spaces. The advantages of the model are demonstrated for automatic cancer cell detection in acute myeloid leukemia in flow cytometry data, where the features measured during acquisition often vary between samples. Our proposed architecture's capacity to operate seamlessly across incongruent feature spaces is particularly relevant in this context, where data scarcity arises from the low prevalence of the disease.

This process relies on the global coordinates of anchors and the available measurements between non-anchor and anchor nodes.

In this paper, we formulate a non-convex multi-player potential game for a generic SNL problem to investigate the identification condition of the global Nash equilibrium (NE) therein, where the global NE represents the global solution of SNL. We employ canonical duality theory to transform the non-convex game into a complementary dual problem. Then we develop a conjugation-based algorithm to compute the stationary points of the complementary dual problem. On this basis, we show an identification condition of the global NE: the stationary point of the proposed algorithm satisfies a duality relation. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. ",
