    "title": "Decoding Social Sentiment in DAO: A Comparative Analysis of Blockchain  Governance Communities",
    "abstract": "Blockchain technology is leading a revolutionary transformation across diverse industries, with effective governance standing as a critical determinant for the success and sustainability of blockchain projects. Community forums, pivotal in engaging decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), wield a substantial impact on blockchain governance decisions. Concurrently, Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, provides powerful insights from textual data. While prior research has explored the potential of NLP tools in social media sentiment analysis, a gap persists in understanding the sentiment landscape of blockchain governance communities. The evolving discourse and sentiment dynamics on the forums of top DAOs remain largely unknown. This paper delves deep into the evolving discourse and sentiment dynamics on the public forums of leading DeFi projects -- Aave, Uniswap, Curve Dao, Aragon, Yearn.finance, Merit Circle, and Balancer -- placing a primary focus on discussions related to governance issues. Despite differing activity patterns, participants across these decentralized communities consistently express positive sentiments in their Discord discussions, indicating optimism towards governance decisions. Additionally, our research suggests a potential interplay between discussion intensity and sentiment dynamics, indicating that higher discussion volumes may contribute to more stable and positive emotions. The insights gained from this study are valuable for decision-makers in blockchain governance, underscoring the pivotal role of sentiment analysis in interpreting community emotions and its evolving impact on the landscape of blockchain governance. This research significantly contributes to the interdisciplinary exploration of the intersection of blockchain and society, with a specific emphasis on the decentralized blockchain governance ecosystem.

    "abstract": "We provide a new algorithmic framework for differentially private estimation of general functions that adapts to the hardness of the underlying dataset. We build upon previous work that gives a paradigm for selecting an output through the exponential mechanism based upon closeness of the inverse to the underlying dataset, termed the inverse sensitivity mechanism. Our framework will slightly modify the closeness metric and instead give a simple and efficient application of the sparse vector technique. While the inverse sensitivity mechanism was shown to be instance optimal, it was only with respect to a class of unbiased mechanisms such that the most likely outcome matches the underlying data. We break this assumption in order to more naturally navigate the bias-variance tradeoff, which will also critically allow for extending our method to unbounded data. In consideration of this tradeoff, we provide strong intuition and empirical validation that our technique will be particularly effective when the distances to the underlying dataset are asymmetric. This asymmetry is inherent to a range of important problems including fundamental statistics such as variance, as well as commonly used machine learning performance metrics for both classification and regression tasks. We efficiently instantiate our method in $O(n)$ time for these problems and empirically show that our techniques will give substantially improved differentially private estimations. ",

    "abstract": "Data science has been described as the fourth paradigm for scientific discovery. The latest wave of data science research, pertaining to machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), is growing exponentially and garnering millions of annual citations. However, this growth has been accompanied by a diminishing emphasis on social good challenges - our analysis reveals that the proportion of data science research focusing on social good is less than it has ever been. At the same time, the proliferation of machine learning and generative AI have sparked debates about the socio-technical prospects and challenges associated with data science for human flourishing, organizations, and society. Against this backdrop, we present a framework for \"data science for social good\" (DSSG) research that considers the interplay between relevant data science research genres, social good challenges, and different levels of socio-technical abstraction. We perform an analysis of the literature to empirically demonstrate the paucity of work on DSSG in information systems (and other related disciplines) and highlight current impediments. We then use our proposed framework to introduce the articles appearing in the special issue. We hope that this article and the special issue will spur future DSSG research and help reverse the alarming trend across data science research over the past 30-plus years in which social good challenges are garnering proportionately less attention with each passing day.

Notably, a symbiotic mechanism is employed to implement these technologies practically, thereby making urban management more agile and responsive. In the case study, we explore how this approach can optimize traffic flow by adjusting lane allocations. This case not only enhances traffic efficiency but also reduces emissions. The proposed evolutionary city offers a new perspective on sustainable urban development, highliting the importance of integrated intelligence within urban systems. ",

In this paper, we examine the current state of AI in education and explore the potential benefits and challenges of incorporating this technology into the classroom.

However, teaching AI must not be siloed or interdisciplinary. Rather, AI instruction ought to be transdisciplinary, including connections to the broad curriculum and community in which students are learning. This paper delves into the AI program currently in development for Neom Community School and the larger Education, Research, and Innovation Sector in Neom, Saudi Arabia s new megacity under development. In this program, AI is both taught as a subject and to learn other subjects within the curriculum through the school systems International Baccalaureate (IB) approach, which deploys learning through Units of Inquiry. This approach to education connects subjects across a curriculum under one major guiding question at a time. The proposed method offers a meaningful approach to introducing AI to students throughout these Units of Inquiry, as it shifts AI from a subject that students like or not like to a subject that is taught throughout the curriculum.

Our study involved a survey of 5,260 users of Chai, a Social AI Platform. The findings indicate significant benefits, with notable variations across demographics.

With recent developments like the introduction of neural operators, AI's potential for being used in mechanics applications has increased significantly. However, AI's immense energy and resource requirements are a hurdle in its practical field use case. The proposed VS-WNO is based on the principles of spiking neural networks, which have shown promise in reducing the energy requirements of the neural networks. This makes possible the use of such algorithms in edge computing. The proposed VS-WNO utilizes variable spiking neurons, which promote sparse communication, thus conserving energy, and its use is further supported by its ability to tackle regression tasks, often faced in the field of mechanics. Various examples dealing with partial differential equations, like Burger's equation, Allen Cahn's equation, and Darcy's equation, have been shown. Comparisons have been shown against wavelet neural operator utilizing leaky integrate and fire neurons (direct and encoded inputs) and vanilla wavelet neural operator utilizing artificial neurons. The results produced illustrate the ability of the proposed VS-WNO to converge to ground truth while promoting sparse communication. ",

    "abstract": "The rising influence of social media platforms in various domains, including tourism, has highlighted the growing need for efficient and automated natural language processing (NLP) approaches to take advantage of this valuable resource. However, the transformation of multilingual, unstructured, and informal texts into structured knowledge often poses significant challenges. In this work, we evaluate and compare few-shot, pattern-exploiting and fine-tuning machine learning techniques on large multilingual language models (LLMs) to establish the best strategy to address the lack of annotated data for 3 common NLP tasks in the tourism domain: (1) Sentiment Analysis, (2) Named Entity Recognition, and (3) Fine-grained Thematic Concept Extraction (linked to a semantic resource). Furthermore, we aim to ascertain the quantity of annotated examples required to achieve good performance in those 3 tasks, addressing a common challenge encountered by NLP researchers in the construction of domain-specific datasets. Extensive experimentation on a newly collected and annotated multilingual (French, English, and Spanish) dataset composed of tourism-related tweets shows that current few-shot learning techniques allow us to obtain competitive results for all three tasks with very little annotation data: 5 tweets per label (15 in total) for Sentiment Analysis, 10% of the tweets for location detection (around 160) and 13% (200 approx.) of the tweets annotated with thematic concepts, a highly fine-grained sequence labeling task based on an inventory of 315 classes. This comparative analysis, grounded in a novel dataset, paves the way for applying NLP to new domain-specific applications, reducing the need for manual annotations and circumventing the complexities of rule-based, ad hoc solutions.

In particular, researchers have hypothesized that dataset diversity and dataset quality are important indicators of downstream performance. However, it is not clear how to automatically select high quality and diverse data or how exactly quality and diversity affect instruction following ability. To resolve these issues, we propose a new algorithm, Quality-Diversity Instruction Tuning (QDIT). QDIT provides a principled algorithm to control dataset diversity and quality, allowing us to conduct an in depth study on the effect of diversity and quality on instruction tuning performance. From this study we draw two key insights (1) there is a natural tradeoff between dataset diversity and quality and (2) increasing dataset diversity significantly improves the worst case instruction following performance, therefore improving robustness. We validate the performance of QDIT on several large scale instruction tuning datasets, where we find it can improve worst case performance by 18% while maintaining or improving average performance compared to quality driven baselines.

The traditional approach models the relevance based product titles and queries, but the information in titles alone maybe insufficient to describe the products completely. A more general optimization approach is to further leverage product image information. In recent years, vision-language pre-training models have achieved impressive results in many scenarios, which leverage contrastive learning to map both textual and visual features into a joint embedding space. In e-commerce, a common practice is to fine-tune on the pre-trained model based on e-commerce data. However, the performance is sub-optimal because the vision-language pre-training models lack of alignment specifically designed for queries. In this paper, we propose a method called Query-LIFE (Query-aware Language Image Fusion Embedding) to address these challenges. Query-LIFE utilizes a query-based multimodal fusion to effectively incorporate the image and title based on the product types. Additionally, it employs query-aware modal alignment to enhance the accuracy of the comprehensive representation of products. Furthermore, we design GenFilt, which utilizes the generation capability of large models to filter out false negative samples and further improve the overall performance of the contrastive learning task in the model. Experiments have demonstrated that Query-LIFE outperforms existing baselines. We have conducted ablation studies and human evaluations to validate the effectiveness of each module within Query-LIFE. Moreover, Query-LIFE has been deployed on Miravia Search, resulting in improved both relevance and conversion efficiency. ",

We propose an innovative model framework that provides a unified solution for the salient object detection task of three types of data (RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-T). The three types of data can be handled in one model (all in one) with the same weight parameters. In this framework, the three types of data are concatenated in an ordered manner within a single input batch, and features are extracted using a transformer network. Based on this framework, we propose an efficient lightweight SOD model, namely AiOSOD, which can detect any RGB, RGB-D, and RGB-T data with high speed (780FPS for RGB data, 485FPS for RGB-D or RGB-T data).

In contrast, Compositional Zero-Shot Learning uses the inherent hierarchies and structural connections among classes, creating new class representations by combining attributes, components, or other semantic elements. In our paper, we propose a novel framework that for the first time combines the Modern Hopfield Network with a Mixture of Experts (HOMOE) to classify the compositions of previously unseen objects. Specifically, the Modern Hopfield Network creates a memory that stores label prototypes and identifies relevant labels for a given input image. Following this, the Mixture of Expert models integrates the image with the fitting prototype to produce the final composition classification.

    "abstract": "Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL) has yielded remarkable performance by designing a series of unbiased visual-semantics mappings, wherein, the precision relies heavily on the completeness of extracted visual features from both seen and unseen classes. However, as a common practice in GZSL, the pre-trained feature extractor may easily exhibit difficulty in capturing domain-specific traits of the downstream tasks/datasets to provide fine-grained discriminative features, i.e., domain bias, which hinders the overall recognition performance, especially for unseen classes. Recent studies partially address this issue by fine-tuning feature extractors, while may inevitably incur catastrophic forgetting and overfitting issues. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Attribute-Aware Representation Rectification framework for GZSL, dubbed $\\mathbf{(AR)^{2}}$, to adaptively rectify the feature extractor to learn novel features while keeping original valuable features. Specifically, our method consists of two key components, i.e., Unseen-Aware Distillation (UAD) and Attribute-Guided Learning (AGL). During training, UAD exploits the prior knowledge of attribute texts that are shared by both seen/unseen classes with attention mechanisms to detect and maintain unseen class-sensitive visual features in a targeted manner, and meanwhile, AGL aims to steer the model to focus on valuable features and suppress them to fit noisy elements in the seen classes by attribute-guided representation learning. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. ",

In this paper, we propose ExCeL that combines both extreme and collective information within the output layer for enhanced accuracy in OOD detection. We leverage the logit of the top predicted class as the extreme information (i.e., the maximum logit), while the collective information is derived in a novel approach that involves assessing the likelihood of other classes appearing in subsequent ranks across various training samples. Our idea is motivated by the observation that, for in-distribution (ID) data, the ranking of classes beyond the predicted class is more deterministic compared to that in OOD data. Experiments conducted on CIFAR100 and ImageNet-200 datasets demonstrate that ExCeL consistently is among the five top-performing methods out of twenty-one existing post-hoc baselines when the joint performance on near-OOD and far-OOD is considered (i.e., in terms of AUROC and FPR95). Furthermore, ExCeL shows the best overall performance across both datasets, unlike other baselines that work best on one dataset but has a performance drop in the other. ",

    "abstract": "Data-Free Meta-Learning (DFML) aims to efficiently learn new tasks by leveraging multiple pre-trained models without requiring their original training data. Existing inversion-based DFML methods construct pseudo tasks from a learnable dataset, which is inversely generated from the pre-trained model pool. For the first time, we reveal two major challenges hindering their practical deployments: Task-Distribution Shift (TDS) and Task-Distribution Corruption (TDC). TDS leads to a biased meta-learner because of the skewed task distribution towards newly generated tasks. TDC occurs when untrusted models characterized by misleading labels or poor quality pollute the task distribution. To tackle these issues, we introduce a robust DFML framework that ensures task distributional robustness. We propose to meta-learn from a pseudo task distribution, diversified through task interpolation within a compact task-memory buffer. This approach reduces the meta-learner's overreliance on newly generated tasks by maintaining consistent performance across a broader range of interpolated memory tasks, thus ensuring its generalization for unseen tasks. Additionally, our framework seamlessly incorporates an automated model selection mechanism into the meta-training phase, parameterizing each model's reliability as a learnable weight. This is optimized with a policy gradient algorithm inspired by reinforcement learning, effectively addressing the non-differentiable challenge posed by model selection. Comprehensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in mitigating TDS and TDC, underscoring its potential to improve DFML in real-world scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Single point-supervised object detection is gaining attention due to its cost-effectiveness. However, existing approaches focus on generating horizontal bounding boxes (HBBs) while ignoring oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) commonly used for objects in aerial images. This paper proposes PointOBB, the first single Point-based OBB generation method, for oriented object detection. PointOBB operates through the collaborative utilization of three distinctive views: an original view, a resized view, and a rotated/flipped (rot/flp) view. Upon the original view, we leverage the resized and rot/flp views to build a scale augmentation module and an angle acquisition module, respectively. In the former module, a Scale-Sensitive Consistency (SSC) loss is designed to enhance the deep network's ability to perceive the object scale. For accurate object angle predictions, the latter module incorporates self-supervised learning to predict angles, which is associated with a scale-guided Dense-to-Sparse (DS) matching strategy for aggregating dense angles corresponding to sparse objects. The resized and rot/flp views are switched using a progressive multi-view switching strategy during training to achieve coupled optimization of scale and angle. Experimental results on the DIOR-R and DOTA-v1.0 datasets demonstrate that PointOBB achieves promising performance, and significantly outperforms potential point-supervised baselines. ",

    "abstract": "With the rapidly increasing demand for oriented object detection (OOD), recent research involving weakly-supervised detectors for learning rotated box (RBox) from the horizontal box (HBox) has attracted more and more attention. In this paper, we explore a more challenging yet label-efficient setting, namely single point-supervised OOD, and present our approach called Point2RBox. Specifically, we propose to leverage two principles: 1) Synthetic pattern knowledge combination: By sampling around each labelled point on the image, we transfer the object feature to synthetic visual patterns with the known bounding box to provide the knowledge for box regression. 2) Transform self-supervision: With a transformed input image (e.g. scaled/rotated), the output RBoxes are trained to follow the same transformation so that the network can perceive the relative size/rotation between objects. The detector is further enhanced by a few devised techniques to cope with peripheral issues, e.g. the anchor/layer assignment as the size of the object is not available in our point supervision setting. To our best knowledge, Point2RBox is the first end-to-end solution for point-supervised OOD. In particular, our method uses a lightweight paradigm, yet it achieves a competitive performance among point-supervised alternatives, 41.05%/27.62%/80.01% on DOTA/DIOR/HRSC datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks are an important security concern for computer vision (CV), as they enable malicious attackers to reliably manipulate CV models. Existing attacks aim to elicit an output desired by the attacker, but keep the model fully intact on clean data. With CV models becoming increasingly valuable assets in applied practice, a new attack vector is emerging: disrupting the models as a form of economic sabotage. This paper opens up the exploration of damaging adversarial attacks (DAAs) that seek to damage the target model and maximize the total cost incurred by the damage. As a pioneer DAA, this paper proposes Trainwreck, a train-time attack that poisons the training data of image classifiers to degrade their performance. Trainwreck conflates the data of similar classes using stealthy ($\\epsilon \\leq 8/255$) class-pair universal perturbations computed using a surrogate model. Trainwreck is a black-box, transferable attack: it requires no knowledge of the target model's architecture, and a single poisoned dataset degrades the performance of any model trained on it. The experimental evaluation on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrates that Trainwreck is indeed an effective attack across various model architectures including EfficientNetV2, ResNeXt-101, and a finetuned ViT-L-16. The strength of the attack can be customized by the poison rate parameter. Finally, data redundancy with file hashing and/or pixel difference are identified as a reliable defense technique against Trainwreck or similar DAAs.

Many leading methods discover anomalies by detecting an unusual part of a sample. For example, state-of-the-art segmentation-based approaches, first classify each element of the sample (e.g., image patch) as normal or anomalous and then classify the entire sample as anomalous if it contains anomalous elements. However, such approaches do not extend well to scenarios where the anomalies are expressed by an unusual combination of normal elements. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by proposing set features that model each sample by the distribution of its elements. We compute the anomaly score of each sample using a simple density estimation method, using fixed features. Our approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in image-level logical anomaly detection and sequence-level time series anomaly detection. ",

Traditional diagnostic methods, primarily relying on electroencephalograms (EEGs), often result in cumbersome and non-portable solutions, making continuous patient monitoring challenging. The video-based seizure detection system is expected to free patients from the constraints of scalp or implanted EEG devices and enable remote monitoring in residential settings. Previous video-based methods neither enable all-day monitoring nor provide short detection latency due to insufficient resources and ineffective patient action recognition techniques. Additionally, skeleton-based action recognition approaches remain limitations in identifying subtle seizure-related actions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel skeleton-based spatiotemporal vision graph neural network (STViG) for efficient, accurate, and timely REal-time Automated Detection of epileptic Seizures from surveillance Videos (READS-V). Our experimental results indicate STViG outperforms previous state-of-the-art action recognition models on our collected patients' video data with higher accuracy (5.9% error) and lower FLOPs (0.4G). Furthermore, by integrating a decision-making rule that combines output probabilities and an accumulative function, our READS-V system achieves a 5.1 s EEG onset detection latency, a 13.1 s advance in clinical onset detection, and zero false detection rate.

By experimenting on a large financial dataset of more than 80M cross-country wire transfers, we leverage on the properties of complex networks to develop a tool for explainable anomaly detection, that can help in identifying outliers that could be engaged in potentially malicious activities according to financial regulations. We identify a set of network centrality measures that provide useful insights on individual nodes; by keeping track of the evolution over time of the centrality-based node rankings, we are able to highlight sudden and unexpected changes in the roles of individual nodes that deserve further attention by AFC officers. Such changes can hardly be noticed by means of current AFC practices, that sometimes can lack a higher-level, global vision of the system. This approach represents a preliminary step in the automation of AFC and AML processes, serving the purpose of facilitating the work of AFC officers by providing them with a top-down view of the picture emerging from financial data.

Although these vision-based models have shown promising results, they face limitations in effectively capturing and utilizing the dynamic spatio-temporal interactions between the target pedestrian and its surrounding traffic elements, crucial for accurate reasoning. Additionally, training these models requires manually annotating domain-specific datasets, a process that is expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to generalize to new environments and scenarios. The recent emergence of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offers potential solutions to these limitations due to their superior visual understanding and causal reasoning capabilities, which can be harnessed through semi-supervised training.

Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate GPT-4V(ision)'s promise in zero-shot pedestrian behavior prediction and driving scene understanding ability for autonomous driving. However, it still falls short of the state-of-the-art traditional domain-specific models. Challenges include difficulties in handling small pedestrians and vehicles in motion.

Current approaches rely on single deep-learning models, like CNNs, which employ a large amount of data to capture underlying patterns. Training a new defect classifier with limited samples often leads to overfitting and poor performance on unseen images. To address this, researchers have advocated transfer learning and fine-tuning the pre-trained models. However, using a single backbone network in transfer learning still may cause bottleneck issues and inconsistent performance if it is not suitable for a specific problem domain. To overcome these challenges, we propose a reusable AI-enabled defect detection approach. By combining ensemble learning with transfer learning models (VGG-19, MobileNetV3, and ResNet-50), we improved the classification accuracy and achieved consistent performance at a certain phase of training. Our empirical analysis demonstrates better and more consistent performance compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. The consistency substantiates the reusability of the defect detection system for newly evolved defected rail parts. Therefore we anticipate these findings to benefit further research and development of reusable AI-enabled solutions for railway systems. ",

Initially, the graph-based framework is utilized to generate diverse thermal management system architectures. The dynamics of these system architectures are modeled under various loading conditions, and an open-loop optimal controller is employed to determine each system's optimal performance. These modeled cases constitute the dataset, with the corresponding optimal performance values serving as the labels for the data. In the subsequent step, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model is trained on 30% of the labeled data to predict the systems' performance, effectively addressing a regression problem. Utilizing this trained model, we estimate the performance values for the remaining 70% of the data, which serves as the test set. In the third step, the predicted performance values are employed to rank the test data, facilitating prioritized evaluation of the design scenarios. Specifically, a small subset of the test data with the highest estimated ranks undergoes evaluation via the open-loop optimal control solver. This targeted approach concentrates on evaluating higher-ranked designs identified by the GNN, replacing the exhaustive search (enumeration-based) of all design cases. The results demonstrate a significant average reduction of over 92% in the number of system dynamic modeling and optimal control analyses required to identify optimal design scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "The rate of terror attacks has surged over the past decade, resulting in the tragic and senseless loss or alteration of numerous lives. Offenders behind mass shootings, bombings, or other domestic terrorism incidents have historically exhibited warning signs on social media before carrying out actual incidents. However, due to inadequate and comprehensive police procedures, authorities and social media platforms are often unable to detect these early indicators of intent. To tackle this issue, we aim to create a multimodal model capable of predicting sentiments simultaneously from both images (i.e., social media photos) and text (i.e., social media posts), generating a unified prediction. The proposed method involves segregating the image and text components of an online post and utilizing a captioning model to generate sentences summarizing the image's contents. Subsequently, a sentiment analyzer evaluates this caption, or description, along with the original post's text to determine whether the post is positive (i.e., concerning) or negative (i.e., benign). This undertaking represents a significant step toward implementing the developed system in real-world scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, 3D anomaly detection, a crucial problem involving fine-grained geometry discrimination, is getting more attention. However, the lack of abundant real 3D anomaly data limits the scalability of current models. To enable scalable anomaly data collection, we propose a 3D anomaly synthesis pipeline to adapt existing large-scale 3Dmodels for 3D anomaly detection. Specifically, we construct a synthetic dataset, i.e., Anomaly-ShapeNet, basedon ShapeNet. Anomaly-ShapeNet consists of 1600 point cloud samples under 40 categories, which provides a rich and varied collection of data, enabling efficient training and enhancing adaptability to industrial scenarios. Meanwhile,to enable scalable representation learning for 3D anomaly localization, we propose a self-supervised method, i.e., Iterative Mask Reconstruction Network (IMRNet). During training, we propose a geometry-aware sample module to preserve potentially anomalous local regions during point cloud down-sampling. Then, we randomly mask out point patches and sent the visible patches to a transformer for reconstruction-based self-supervision. During testing, the point cloud repeatedly goes through the Mask Reconstruction Network, with each iteration's output becoming the next input. By merging and contrasting the final reconstructed point cloud with the initial input, our method successfully locates anomalies. Experiments show that IMRNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving 66.1% in I-AUC on Anomaly-ShapeNet dataset and 72.5% in I-AUC on Real3D-AD dataset.

    "abstract": "Full-graph training on graph neural networks (GNN) has emerged as a promising training method for its effectiveness. Full-graph training requires extensive memory and computation resources. To accelerate this training process, researchers have proposed employing multi-GPU processing. However the scalability of existing frameworks is limited as they necessitate maintaining the training data for every layer in GPU memory. To efficiently train on large graphs, we present HongTu, a scalable full-graph GNN training system running on GPU-accelerated platforms. HongTu stores vertex data in CPU memory and offloads training to GPUs. HongTu employs a memory-efficient full-graph training framework that reduces runtime memory consumption by using partition-based training and recomputation-caching-hybrid intermediate data management. To address the issue of increased host-GPU communication caused by duplicated neighbor access among partitions, HongTu employs a deduplicated communication framework that converts the redundant host-GPU communication to efficient inter/intra-GPU data access. Further, HongTu uses a cost model-guided graph reorganization method to minimize communication overhead. Experimental results on a 4XA100 GPU server show that HongTu effectively supports billion-scale full-graph GNN training while reducing host-GPU data communication by 25%-71%. Compared to the full-graph GNN system DistGNN running on 16 CPU nodes, HongTu achieves speedups ranging from 7.8X to 20.2X. For small graphs where the training data fits into the GPUs, HongTu achieves performance comparable to existing GPU-based GNN systems. ",

Due to different development conventions (e.g., prefer long queries or abbreviations), some programmers will find the engine useful, while others may find it hard to get desirable search results. To mitigate biases, we develop a general debiasing framework that employs reranking to calibrate search results.

Specifically, we designed a multimodal co-attention module to integrate embeddings from two distinct graph views derived from low dimensional representation of images and clinical features, enabling the extraction of more stable and structured features from the multiview data. Additionally, we have devised a simplified fusion method utilizing a contrastive loss for positive and negative pairs, to enhance the model's overall cross-view fusion learning capabilities. In our experiments, the graph-view multimodal approach can achieve an accuracy rate of 91% and an AUC of 92.8% in five-fold cross-validation, and it also demonstrates superior predictive capabilities on non-image data as compared to methods that rely solely on machine learning methods.

To address this objective ``Explain-in-Plain-English'' questions, in which students are shown a segment of code and asked to provide an abstract description of the code's purpose, have been adopted. However, given EiPE questions require a natural language response, they often require manual grading which is time-consuming for course staff and delays feedback for students. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) capable of generating code, responses to EiPE questions can be used to generate code segments, the correctness of which can then be easily verified using test cases. We refer to this approach as \"Code Generation Based Grading\" (CGBG) and in this paper we explore its agreement with human graders using EiPE responses from past exams in an introductory programming course taught in Python. Overall, we find that CGBG achieves moderate agreement with human graders with the primary area of disagreement being its leniency with respect to low-level and line-by-line descriptions of code. ",

The majority of relevant studies have exclusively concentrated on increasing the quantity and functional correctness of training sets while disregarding other stylistic elements of programs. More recently, data quality has garnered a lot of interest and multiple works have showcased its importance for improving performance. In this work, we investigate data quality for code and find that making the code more structured and readable leads to improved code generation performance of the system. We build a novel data-cleaning pipeline that uses these principles to transform existing programs by 1.) renaming variables, 2.) modularizing and decomposing complex code into smaller helper sub-functions, and 3.) inserting natural-language based plans via LLM based transformations. We evaluate our approach on two challenging algorithmic code generation benchmarks and find that fine-tuning CodeLLaMa-7B on our transformed modularized programs improves the performance by up to 30% compared to fine-tuning on the original dataset. Additionally, we demonstrate improved performance from using a smaller amount of higher-quality data, finding that a model fine-tuned on the entire original dataset is outperformed by a model trained on 15% of our cleaned dataset.

    "abstract": "Predicting pedestrian trajectories is crucial for improving the safety and effectiveness of autonomous driving and mobile robots. However, this task is nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-model prediction. Previous works have used various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from problems, including mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods are straightforward without fully leveraging input information and usually require many denoising iterations leading to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and promote the application of diffusion models in trajectory prediction, we propose a novel scene-aware multi-modal pedestrian trajectory prediction framework called GBD. GBD combines goal prediction with the diffusion network. First, the goal predictor produces multiple goals, and then the diffusion network generates multi-modal trajectories conditioned on these goals. Furthermore, we introduce a new diffusion sampling algorithm named tree sampling (TS), which leverages common feature to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our GBD-TS method achieves state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed. ",

    "abstract": "Despite the advanced capabilities of contemporary machine learning (ML) models, they remain vulnerable to adversarial and backdoor attacks. This vulnerability is particularly concerning in real-world deployments, where compromised models may exhibit unpredictable behavior in critical scenarios. Such risks are heightened by the prevalent practice of collecting massive, internet-sourced datasets for pre-training multimodal models, as these datasets may harbor backdoors. Various techniques have been proposed to mitigate the effects of backdooring in these models such as CleanCLIP which is the current state-of-the-art approach. In this work, we demonstrate that the efficacy of CleanCLIP in mitigating backdoors is highly dependent on the particular objective used during model pre-training. We observe that stronger pre-training objectives correlate with harder to remove backdoors behaviors. We show this by training multimodal models on two large datasets consisting of 3 million (CC3M) and 6 million (CC6M) datapoints, under various pre-training objectives, followed by poison removal using CleanCLIP. We find that CleanCLIP is ineffective when stronger pre-training objectives are used, even with extensive hyperparameter tuning. Our findings underscore critical considerations for ML practitioners who pre-train models using large-scale web-curated data and are concerned about potential backdoor threats. Notably, our results suggest that simpler pre-training objectives are more amenable to effective backdoor removal. This insight is pivotal for practitioners seeking to balance the trade-offs between using stronger pre-training objectives and security against backdoor attacks. ",

Ideally, registration should focus on aligning semantically corresponding voxels, i.e., the same anatomical locations. However, existing methods often optimize similarity measures computed directly on intensities or on hand-crafted features, which lack anatomical semantic information. These similarity measures may lead to sub-optimal solutions where large deformations, complex anatomical differences, or cross-modality imagery exist. In this work, we introduce a fast and accurate method for unsupervised 3D medical image registration building on top of a Self-supervised Anatomical eMbedding (SAM) algorithm, which is capable of computing dense anatomical correspondences between two images at the voxel level. We name our approach SAM-Enhanced registration (SAME++), which decomposes image registration into four steps: affine transformation, coarse deformation, deep non-parametric transformation, and instance optimization. Using SAM embeddings, we enhance these steps by finding more coherent correspondence and providing features with better semantic guidance. We extensively evaluated SAME++ using more than 50 labeled organs on three challenging inter-subject registration tasks of different body parts. As a complete registration framework, SAME++ markedly outperforms leading methods by $4.2\\%$ - $8.2\\%$ in terms of Dice score while being orders of magnitude faster than numerical optimization-based methods.

    "abstract": "Neural fields, mapping low-dimensional input coordinates to corresponding signals, have shown promising results in representing various signals. Numerous methodologies have been proposed, and techniques employing MLPs and grid representations have achieved substantial success. MLPs allow compact and high expressibility, yet often suffer from spectral bias and slow convergence speed. On the other hand, methods using grids are free from spectral bias and achieve fast training speed, however, at the expense of high spatial complexity. In this work, we propose a novel way for exploiting both MLPs and grid representations in neural fields. Unlike the prevalent methods that combine them sequentially (extract features from the grids first and feed them to the MLP), we inject spectral bias-free grid representations into the intermediate features in the MLP. More specifically, we suggest a Coordinate-Aware Modulation (CAM), which modulates the intermediate features using scale and shift parameters extracted from the grid representations. This can maintain the strengths of MLPs while mitigating any remaining potential biases, facilitating the rapid learning of high-frequency components. In addition, we empirically found that the feature normalizations, which have not been successful in neural filed literature, proved to be effective when applied in conjunction with the proposed CAM. Experimental results demonstrate that CAM enhances the performance of neural representation and improves learning stability across a range of signals. Especially in the novel view synthesis task, we achieved state-of-the-art performance with the least number of parameters and fast training speed for dynamic scenes and the best performance under 1MB memory for static scenes. CAM also outperforms the best-performing video compression methods using neural fields by a large margin. ",

    "abstract": "In machine learning, exploring data correlations to predict outcomes is a fundamental task. Recognizing causal relationships embedded within data is pivotal for a comprehensive understanding of system dynamics, the significance of which is paramount in data-driven decision-making processes. Beyond traditional methods, there has been a surge in the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for causal learning, given their capabilities as universal data approximators. Thus, a thorough review of the advancements in causal learning using GNNs is both relevant and timely. To structure this review, we introduce a novel taxonomy that encompasses various state-of-the-art GNN methods employed in studying causality. GNNs are further categorized based on their applications in the causality domain. We further provide an exhaustive compilation of datasets integral to causal learning with GNNs to serve as a resource for practical study. This review also touches upon the application of causal learning across diverse sectors. We conclude the review with insights into potential challenges and promising avenues for future exploration in this rapidly evolving field of machine learning. ",

    "abstract": "Shellfish production constitutes an important sector for the economy of many Portuguese coastal regions, yet the challenge of shellfish biotoxin contamination poses both public health concerns and significant economic risks. Thus, predicting shellfish contamination levels holds great potential for enhancing production management and safeguarding public health. In our study, we utilize a dataset with years of Sentinel-3 satellite imagery for marine surveillance, along with shellfish biotoxin contamination data from various production areas along Portugal's western coastline, collected by Portuguese official control. Our goal is to evaluate the integration of satellite data in forecasting models for predicting toxin concentrations in shellfish given forecasting horizons up to four weeks, which implies extracting a small set of useful features and assessing their impact on the predictive models. We framed this challenge as a time-series forecasting problem, leveraging historical contamination levels and satellite images for designated areas. While contamination measurements occurred weekly, satellite images were accessible multiple times per week. Unsupervised feature extraction was performed using autoencoders able to handle non-valid pixels caused by factors like cloud cover, land, or anomalies. Finally, several Artificial Neural Networks models were applied to compare univariate (contamination only) and multivariate (contamination and satellite data) time-series forecasting. Our findings show that incorporating these features enhances predictions, especially beyond one week in lagoon production areas (RIAV) and for the 1-week and 2-week horizons in the L5B area (oceanic). The methodology shows the feasibility of integrating information from a high-dimensional data source like remote sensing without compromising the model's predictive ability. ",

However, the capacity of air-to-air communications is limited due to the multi-hop transmissions. In this paper, the spectrum sharing between UAV-based wireless mesh networks and ground networks is studied to improve the capacity of the UAV networks. Considering the distribution of UAVs as a three-dimensional (3D) homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) within a vertical range, the stochastic geometry is applied to analyze the impact of the height of UAVs, the transmit power of UAVs, the density of UAVs and the vertical range, etc., on the coverage probability of ground network user and UAV network user, respectively. The optimal height of UAVs is numerically achieved in maximizing the capacity of UAV networks with the constraint of the coverage probability of ground network user. This paper provides a basic guideline for the deployment of UAV-based wireless mesh networks. ",

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely exploited in environment monitoring, search-and-rescue, etc. However, the mobility and short flight duration of UAVs bring challenges for UAV networking. In this paper, we study the UAV networks with n UAVs acting as aerial sensors. UAVs generally have short flight duration and need to frequently get energy replenishment from the control station. Hence the returning UAVs bring the data of the UAVs along the returning paths to the control station with a store-carry-and-forward (SCF) mode. A critical range for the distance between the UAV and the control station is discovered. Within the critical range, the per-node capacity of the SCF mode is O(n/log n) times higher than that of the multi-hop mode. However, the per-node capacity of the SCF mode outside the critical range decreases with the distance between the UAV and the control station. To eliminate the critical range, a mobility control scheme is proposed such that the capacity scaling laws of the SCF mode are the same for all UAVs, which improves the capacity performance of UAV networks. Moreover, the delay of the SCF mode is derived. The impact of the size of the entire region, the velocity of UAVs, the number of UAVs and the flight duration of UAVs on the delay of SCF mode is analyzed. This paper reveals that the mobility and short flight duration of UAVs have beneficial effects on the performance of UAV networks, which may motivate the study of SCF schemes for UAV networks. ",

While traditional perturbation methods make only use of occlusions to explain the model predictions, OSA-DAS extends standard occlusion sensitivity analysis by enabling the integration with diverse image augmentations. Distinctly, our method utilizes the output vector of a DNN to build low-dimensional subspaces within the deep feature vector space, offering a more precise explanation of the model prediction. The structural similarity between these subspaces encompasses the influence of diverse augmentations and occlusions. We test extensively on the ImageNet-1k, and our class- and model-agnostic approach outperforms commonly used interpreters, setting it apart in the realm of explainable AI. ",

    "abstract": "As an emerging concept, steganography without embedding (SWE) hides a secret message without directly embedding it into a cover. Thus, SWE has the unique advantage of being immune to typical steganalysis methods and can better protect the secret message from being exposed. However, existing SWE methods are generally criticized for their poor payload capacity and low fidelity of recovered secret messages. In this paper, we propose a novel steganography-without-embedding technique, named DF-SWE, which addresses the aforementioned drawbacks and produces diverse and natural stego images. Specifically, DF-SWE employs a reversible circulation of double flow to build a reversible bijective transformation between the secret image and the generated stego image. Hence, it provides a way to directly generate stego images from secret images without a cover image. Besides leveraging the invertible property, DF-SWE can invert a secret image from a generated stego image in a nearly lossless manner and increases the fidelity of extracted secret images. To the best of our knowledge, DF-SWE is the first SWE method that can hide large images and multiple images into one image with the same size, significantly enhancing the payload capacity. According to the experimental results, the payload capacity of DF-SWE achieves 24-72 BPP is 8000-16000 times compared to its competitors while producing diverse images to minimize the exposure risk. Importantly, DF-SWE can be applied in the steganography of secret images in various domains without requiring training data from the corresponding domains. This domain-agnostic property suggests that DF-SWE can 1) be applied to hiding private data and 2) be deployed in resource-limited systems. ",

Early identification and intervention are crucial to prevent negative long-term outcomes impacting the academic, social, and emotional development of children. The study aims to develop an automated method for the identification of DLD using artificial intelligence, specifically a neural network machine learning algorithm. This protocol is applied for the first time in Cypriot Greek children, which is generally considered underresearched in the context of DLD. The neural network model was trained using perceptual and production data elicited from children with DLD and healthy controls. The k-fold technique was used to crossvalidate the algorithm. The performance of the model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC/AUC curve to assess its ability to make accurate predictions on a set of unseen data. The results demonstrated high classification values for all metrics (between 0.92 and 0.98), indicating the high accuracy of the neural model in classifying children with DLD. Additionally, the variable importance analysis revealed that the language production skills of children had a more significant impact on the performance of the model compared to perception skills. Neural networks represent powerful tools for detecting DLD, providing early and quick assessments of the disorder, and having the potential to improve clinical outcomes. ",

Recently, deep learning techniques have been developed for DDI prediction. However, they generally require a huge number of samples, while known DDIs are rare. Methods: In this work, we present KnowDDI, a graph neural network-based method that addresses the above challenge. KnowDDI enhances drug representations by adaptively leveraging rich neighborhood information from large biomedical knowledge graphs. Then, it learns a knowledge subgraph for each drug-pair to interpret the predicted DDI, where each of the edges is associated with a connection strength indicating the importance of a known DDI or resembling strength between a drug-pair whose connection is unknown. Thus, the lack of DDIs is implicitly compensated by the enriched drug representations and propagated drug similarities. Results: We evaluate KnowDDI on two benchmark DDI datasets. Results show that KnowDDI obtains the state-of-the-art prediction performance with better interpretability. We also find that KnowDDI suffers less than existing works given a sparser knowledge graph. This indicates that the propagated drug similarities play a more important role in compensating for the lack of DDIs when the drug representations are less enriched. Conclusions: KnowDDI nicely combines the efficiency of deep learning techniques and the rich prior knowledge in biomedical knowledge graphs. As an original open-source tool, KnowDDI can help detect possible interactions in a broad range of relevant interaction prediction tasks, such as protein-protein interactions, drug-target interactions and disease-gene interactions, eventually promoting the development of biomedicine and healthcare.

By considering the essence of environment and how much the agent learn from each scenario in that environment, the strategy of the learning procedure can be changed. The strategy retrieves more informative trajectories, so the agent can learn with fewer trajectory sample. We propose Where2Start algorithm that selects the initial state so that the agent has more instability in vicinity of that state. We show that this kind of selection decreases number of trajectories that should be sampled that the agent reach to acceptable reward.

    "abstract": "In optimal transport (OT), a Monge map is known as a mapping that transports a source distribution to a target distribution in the most cost-efficient way. Recently, multiple neural estimators for Monge maps have been developed and applied in diverse unpaired domain translation tasks, e.g. in single-cell biology and computer vision. However, the classic OT framework enforces mass conservation, which makes it prone to outliers and limits its applicability in real-world scenarios. The latter can be particularly harmful in OT domain translation tasks, where the relative position of a sample within a distribution is explicitly taken into account. While unbalanced OT tackles this challenge in the discrete setting, its integration into neural Monge map estimators has received limited attention. We propose a theoretically grounded method to incorporate unbalancedness into any Monge map estimator. We improve existing estimators to model cell trajectories over time and to predict cellular responses to perturbations. Moreover, our approach seamlessly integrates with the OT flow matching (OT-FM) framework. While we show that OT-FM performs competitively in image translation, we further improve performance by incorporating unbalancedness (UOT-FM), which better preserves relevant features. We hence establish UOT-FM as a principled method for unpaired image translation. ",

Therefore, this research proposes a more recall-oriented approach to reducing review effort.

In our proposed method, the relevance rankings are produced by a BERT-based dense-vector search and the relevance feedback is based on cumulatively summing the queried and selected embeddings.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have led to major breakthroughs in a variety of domains such as drug discovery, social network analysis, and travel time estimation. However, they lack interpretability which hinders human trust and thereby deployment to settings with high-stakes decisions. A line of interpretable methods approach this by discovering a small set of relevant concepts as subgraphs in the last GNN layer that together explain the prediction. This can yield oversimplified explanations, failing to explain the interaction between GNN layers. To address this oversight, we provide HELP (Hierarchical Explainable Latent Pooling), a novel, inherently interpretable graph pooling approach that reveals how concepts from different GNN layers compose to new ones in later steps. HELP is more than 1-WL expressive and is the first non-spectral, end-to-end-learnable, hierarchical graph pooling method that can learn to pool a variable number of arbitrary connected components. We empirically demonstrate that it performs on-par with standard GCNs and popular pooling methods in terms of accuracy while yielding explanations that are aligned with expert knowledge in the domains of chemistry and social networks. In addition to a qualitative analysis, we employ concept completeness scores as well as concept conformity, a novel metric to measure the noise in discovered concepts, quantitatively verifying that the discovered concepts are significantly easier to fully understand than those from previous work. Our work represents a first step towards an understanding of graph neural networks that goes beyond a set of concepts from the final layer and instead explains the complex interplay of concepts on different levels.

    "abstract": "Procrastination causes student stress, reduced learning and performance, and results in very busy help sessions immediately before deadlines. A key challenge is encouraging students to complete assignments earlier rather than waiting until right before the deadline, so the focus becomes on the learning objectives rather than just meeting deadlines. This work presents an incentive system encouraging students to complete assignments many days before deadlines. Completed assignments are code reviewed by staff for correctness and providing feedback, which results in more student-instructor interactions and may help reduce student use of generative AI. The incentives result in a change in student behavior with 45% of assignments completed early and 30% up to 4 days before the deadline. Students receive real-time feedback with no increase in marking time. ",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel computational approach termed the Reduced Augmentation Implicit Low-rank (RAIL) method by investigating two predominant research directions in low-rank solutions to time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs): dynamical low-rank (DLR), and step and truncation (SAT) tensor methods. The RAIL method, along with the development of the SAT approach, is designed to enhance the efficiency of traditional full-rank implicit solvers from method-of-lines discretizations of time-dependent PDEs, while maintaining accuracy and stability. We consider spectral methods for spatial discretization, and diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) and implicit-explicit (IMEX) RK methods for time discretization. The efficiency gain is achieved by investigating low-rank structures within solutions at each RK stage using a singular value decomposition (SVD). In particular, we develop a reduced augmentation procedure to predict the basis functions to construct projection subspaces. This procedure balances algorithm accuracy and efficiency by incorporating as many bases as possible from previous RK stages and predictions, and by optimizing the basis representation through SVD truncation. As such, one can form implicit schemes for updating basis functions in a dimension-by-dimension manner, similar in spirit to the K-L step in the DLR framework. We also apply a globally mass conservative post-processing step at the end of each RK stage. We validate the RAIL method through numerical simulations of advection-diffusion problems and a Fokker-Planck model, showcasing its ability to efficiently handle time-dependent PDEs while maintaining global mass conservation. Our approach generalizes and bridges the DLR and SAT approaches, offering a comprehensive framework for efficiently and accurately solving time-dependent PDEs with implicit treatment. ",

The major challenge of self-supervised learning for SAR target recognition lies in the generalizable representation learning in low data quality and noise.To address the aforementioned problem, we propose a knowledge-guided predictive architecture that uses local masked patches to predict the multiscale SAR feature representations of unseen context. The core of the proposed architecture lies in combining traditional SAR domain feature extraction with state-of-the-art scalable self-supervised learning for accurate generalized feature representations. The proposed framework is validated on various downstream datasets (MSTAR, FUSAR-Ship, SAR-ACD and SSDD), and can bring consistent performance improvement for SAR target recognition.

The amount of publicly available single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data is already surpassing 50M records for humans with each record measuring 20,000 genes. This highlights the need for unsupervised representation learning to fully ingest these data, yet classical transformer architectures are prohibitive to train on such data in terms of both computation and memory. To address this challenge, we propose a novel asymmetric encoder-decoder transformer for scRNA-seq data, called xTrimoGene$^\\alpha$ (or xTrimoGene for short), which leverages the sparse characteristic of the data to scale up the pre-training. This scalable design of xTrimoGene reduces FLOPs by one to two orders of magnitude compared to classical transformers while maintaining high accuracy, enabling us to train the largest transformer models over the largest scRNA-seq dataset today. Our experiments also show that the performance of xTrimoGene improves as we scale up the model sizes, and it also leads to SOTA performance over various downstream tasks, such as cell type annotation, perturb-seq effect prediction, and drug combination prediction. xTrimoGene model is now available for use as a service via the following link: https://api.biomap.com/xTrimoGene/apply.

    "abstract": "Recent methods for dynamic human reconstruction have attained promising reconstruction results. Most of these methods rely only on RGB color supervision without considering explicit geometric constraints. This leads to existing human reconstruction techniques being more prone to overfitting to color and causes geometrically inherent ambiguities, especially in the sparse multi-view setup. Motivated by recent advances in the field of monocular geometry prediction, we consider the geometric constraints of estimated depth and normals in the learning of neural implicit representation for dynamic human reconstruction. As a geometric regularization, this provides reliable yet explicit supervision information, and improves reconstruction quality. We also exploit several beneficial physical priors, such as adding noise into view direction and maximizing the density on the human surface. These priors ensure the color rendered along rays to be robust to view direction and reduce the inherent ambiguities of density estimated along rays. Experimental results demonstrate that depth and normal cues, predicted by human-specific monocular estimators, can provide effective supervision signals and render more accurate images. Finally, we also show that the proposed physical priors significantly reduce overfitting and improve the overall quality of novel view synthesis.

It is a challenging issue because humans have different walking motions and the interactions between humans and objects in the current environment, especially between human themselves, are complex. Previous researches have focused on how to model the human-human interactions, however, neglecting the relative importance of interactions. In order to address this issue, we introduce a novel mechanism based on the correntropy, which not only can measure the relative importance of human-human interactions, but also can build personal space for each pedestrian. We further propose an Interaction Module including this data-driven mechanism that can effectively extract feature representations of dynamic human-human interactions in the scene and calculate corresponding weights to represent the importance of different interactions. To share such social messages among pedestrians, we design an interaction-aware architecture based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for trajectory prediction. We demonstrate the performance of our model on two public datasets and the experimental results demonstrate that our model can achieve better performance than several latest methods with good performance.

    "abstract": "As children enter elementary school, their understanding of the ordinal structure of numbers transitions from a memorized count list of the first 50-100 numbers to knowing the successor function and understanding the countably infinite. We investigate this developmental change in two neural network models that learn the successor function on the pairs (N, N+1) for N in (0, 98). The first uses a one-hot encoding of the input and output values and corresponds to children memorizing a count list, while the second model uses a place-value encoding and corresponds to children learning the language rules for naming numbers. The place-value model showed a predicted drop in representational similarity across tens boundaries. Counting across a tens boundary can be understood as a vector operation in 2D space, where the numbers with the same tens place are organized in a linearly separable manner, whereas those with the same ones place are grouped together. A curriculum learning simulation shows that, in the expanding numerical environment of the developing child, representations of smaller numbers continue to be sharpened even as larger numbers begin to be learned. These models set the stage for future work using recurrent architectures to move beyond learning the successor function to simulating the counting process more generally, and point towards a deeper understanding of what it means to understand the countably infinite.

    "abstract": "Recently, Mix-style data augmentation methods (e.g., Mixup and CutMix) have shown promising performance in various visual tasks. However, these methods are primarily designed for single-label images, ignoring the considerable discrepancies between single- and multi-label images, i.e., a multi-label image involves multiple co-occurred categories and fickle object scales. On the other hand, previous multi-label image classification (MLIC) methods tend to design elaborate models, bringing expensive computation. In this paper, we introduce a simple but effective augmentation strategy for multi-label image classification, namely SpliceMix. The \"splice\" in our method is two-fold: 1) Each mixed image is a splice of several downsampled images in the form of a grid, where the semantics of images attending to mixing are blended without object deficiencies for alleviating co-occurred bias; 2) We splice mixed images and the original mini-batch to form a new SpliceMixed mini-batch, which allows an image with different scales to contribute to training together. Furthermore, such splice in our SpliceMixed mini-batch enables interactions between mixed images and original regular images. We also offer a simple and non-parametric extension based on consistency learning (SpliceMix-CL) to show the flexible extensibility of our SpliceMix. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate that only using SpliceMix with a baseline model (e.g., ResNet) achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the generalizability of our SpliceMix is further validated by the improvements in current MLIC methods when married with our SpliceMix.

To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-stream contrastive predictive network (DCPNet), which consists of two asymmetric task designs and the false negative sample elimination module. The first task is to construct positive sample pairs, guiding the core encoder to learn more general representations. The second task is to encourage adaptive capture of the correspondence between deep features and handcrated features, achieving knowledge transfer within the model, and effectively improving the redundancy caused by the feature fusion. To increase the separability between clusters, we also design a cluster-level tasks. The experimental results on OpenSARShip and FUSAR-Ship datasets demonstrate the improvement in classification accuracy of supervised models and confirm the capability of learning effective representations of DCPNet.

One vastly successful class of neural models is transformers. When used as an encoder, a transformer produces contextual representation of words in the input sentence. In this work, we propose a new model of contextual word representation, not from a neural perspective, but from a purely syntactic and probabilistic perspective. Specifically, we design a conditional random field that models discrete latent representations of all words in a sentence as well as dependency arcs between them; and we use mean field variational inference for approximate inference. Strikingly, we find that the computation graph of our model resembles transformers, with correspondences between dependencies and self-attention and between distributions over latent representations and contextual embeddings of words. Experiments show that our model performs competitively to transformers on small to medium sized datasets. We hope that our work could help bridge the gap between traditional syntactic and probabilistic approaches and cutting-edge neural approaches to NLP, and inspire more linguistically-principled neural approaches in the future.

Numeral studies show that PI-GCN has better performance and scalability than the baseline MB-GCN on neural diving.

By specifying a target group with high centrality for isolation and quarantine one can reach a much flatter infection curve (related to Corona for example) without adding extra costs to health services. The aim of this research is, first, modeling the epidemic and, then, giving strategies and structural algorithms for targeted vaccination or targeted non-pharmaceutical methods for reducing the peak of the viral disease and flattening the infection curve. These methods are more efficient for nan-pharmaceutical interventions as finding the target quarantine group flattens the infection curve much easier. For this purpose, a few number of particular nodes with high centrality are isolated and the infection curve is analyzed. Our research shows meaningful results for flattening the infection curve only by isolating a few number of targeted nodes in the social network.

Learning-based online calibration methods have been proposed, but their performance is barely satisfactory in most cases. These methods usually suffer from issues such as sparse feature maps, unreliable cross-modality association, inaccurate calibration parameter regression, etc. In this paper, to address these issues, we propose CalibFormer, an end-to-end network for automatic LiDAR-camera calibration. We aggregate multiple layers of camera and LiDAR image features to achieve high-resolution representations.

    "abstract": "Identifying cerebral cortex layers is crucial for comparative studies of the cytoarchitecture aiming at providing insights into the relations between brain structure and function across species. The absence of extensive annotated datasets typically limits the adoption of machine learning approaches, leading to the manual delineation of cortical layers by neuroanatomists. We introduce a self-supervised approach to detect layers in 2D Nissl-stained histological slices of the cerebral cortex. It starts with the segmentation of individual cells and the creation of an attributed cell-graph. A self-supervised graph convolutional network generates cell embeddings that encode morphological and structural traits of the cellular environment and are exploited by a community detection algorithm for the final layering. Our method, the first self-supervised of its kind with no spatial transcriptomics data involved, holds the potential to accelerate cytoarchitecture analyses, sidestepping annotation needs and advancing cross-species investigation.

    "abstract": "Unlike color photography images, which are consistently encoded into RGB channels, biological images encompass various modalities, where the type of microscopy and the meaning of each channel varies with each experiment. Importantly, the number of channels can range from one to a dozen and their correlation is often comparatively much lower than RGB, as each of them brings specific information content. This aspect is largely overlooked by methods designed out of the bioimage field, and current solutions mostly focus on intra-channel spatial attention, often ignoring the relationship between channels, yet crucial in most biological applications. Importantly, the variable channel type and count prevent the projection of several experiments to a unified representation for large scale pre-training. In this study, we propose ChAda-ViT, a novel Channel Adaptive Vision Transformer architecture employing an Inter-Channel Attention mechanism on images with an arbitrary number, order and type of channels. We also introduce IDRCell100k, a bioimage dataset with a rich set of 79 experiments covering 7 microscope modalities, with a multitude of channel types, and channel counts varying from 1 to 10 per experiment. Our proposed architecture, trained in a self-supervised manner, outperforms existing approaches in several biologically relevant downstream tasks. Additionally, it can be used to bridge the gap for the first time between assays with different microscopes, channel numbers or types by embedding various image and experimental modalities into a unified biological image representation. The latter should facilitate interdisciplinary studies and pave the way for better adoption of deep learning in biological image-based analyses. Code and Data to be released soon. ",

However, many existing methods for HMER may fail to accurately read formulas with complex structures, as the attention results can be inaccurate due to illegible handwriting or large variations in writing styles. Our proposed Intelligent-Detection Network (IDN) for HMER differs from traditional encoder-decoder methods by utilizing object detection techniques. Specifically, we have developed an enhanced YOLOv7 network that can accurately detect both digital and symbolic objects. The detection results are then integrated into the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU) and the baseline symbol relationship tree (BSRT) to determine the relationships between symbols and numbers. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms those encoder-decoder networks in recognizing complex handwritten mathematical expressions. This is due to the precise detection of symbols and numbers. Our research has the potential to make valuable contributions to the field of HMER.

    "abstract": "While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been proven effective for low-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), the computational cost remains a hurdle in high-dimensional scenarios. This is particularly pronounced when computing high-order and high-dimensional derivatives in the physics-informed loss. Randomized Smoothing PINN (RS-PINN) introduces Gaussian noise for stochastic smoothing of the original neural net model, enabling Monte Carlo methods for derivative approximation, eliminating the need for costly auto-differentiation. Despite its computational efficiency in high dimensions, RS-PINN introduces biases in both loss and gradients, negatively impacting convergence, especially when coupled with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We present a comprehensive analysis of biases in RS-PINN, attributing them to the nonlinearity of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss and the PDE nonlinearity. We propose tailored bias correction techniques based on the order of PDE nonlinearity. The unbiased RS-PINN allows for a detailed examination of its pros and cons compared to the biased version. Specifically, the biased version has a lower variance and runs faster than the unbiased version, but it is less accurate due to the bias. To optimize the bias-variance trade-off, we combine the two approaches in a hybrid method that balances the rapid convergence of the biased version with the high accuracy of the unbiased version. In addition, we present an enhanced implementation of RS-PINN. Extensive experiments on diverse high-dimensional PDEs, including Fokker-Planck, HJB, viscous Burgers', Allen-Cahn, and Sine-Gordon equations, illustrate the bias-variance trade-off and highlight the effectiveness of the hybrid RS-PINN. Empirical guidelines are provided for selecting biased, unbiased, or hybrid versions, depending on the dimensionality and nonlinearity of the specific PDE problem. ",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the covariance-based activity detection problem in a multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. In this system, active devices transmit their signature sequences to multiple base stations (BSs), and the BSs cooperatively detect the active devices based on the received signals. While the scaling law for the covariance-based activity detection in the single-cell scenario has been extensively analyzed in the literature, this paper aims to analyze the scaling law for the covariance-based activity detection in the multi-cell massive MIMO system. Specifically, this paper demonstrates a quadratic scaling law in the multi-cell system, under the assumption that the exponent in the classical path-loss model is greater than 2. This finding shows that, in the multi-cell MIMO system, the maximum number of active devices that can be detected correctly in each cell increases quadratically with the length of the signature sequence and decreases logarithmically with the number of cells (as the number of antennas tends to infinity). Moreover, in addition to analyzing the scaling law for the signature sequences randomly and uniformly distributed on a sphere, the paper also establishes the scaling law for signature sequences generated from a finite alphabet, which are easier to generate and store. Moreover, this paper proposes two efficient accelerated coordinate descent (CD) algorithms with a convergence guarantee for solving the device activity detection problem. The first algorithm reduces the complexity of CD by using an inexact coordinate update strategy. The second algorithm avoids unnecessary computations of CD by using an active set selection strategy. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms exhibit excellent performance in terms of computational efficiency and detection error probability. ",

To reduce labeling requirement, the \"pre-train, prompt\" paradigms have become increasingly common. However, existing study of prompting on graphs is limited, lacking a universal treatment to appeal to different downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose GraphPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework on graphs. GraphPrompt not only unifies pre-training and downstream tasks into a common task template but also employs a learnable prompt to assist a downstream task in locating the most relevant knowledge from the pre-trained model in a task-specific manner. To further enhance GraphPrompt in these two stages, we extend it into GraphPrompt+ with two major enhancements. First, we generalize several popular graph pre-training tasks beyond simple link prediction to broaden the compatibility with our task template. Second, we propose a more generalized prompt design that incorporates a series of prompt vectors within every layer of the pre-trained graph encoder, in order to capitalize on the hierarchical information across different layers beyond just the readout layer. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets to evaluate and analyze GraphPrompt and GraphPrompt+. ",

This study evaluated interest and boredom hardness scores of the FRAC-Q-learning by a comparison with the traditional Q-learning. The FRAC-Q-learning showed significantly higher trend of interest score, and indicated significantly harder to bore users compared to the traditional Q-learning.

While a few approaches have been developed to handle MCPF, most of them simply direct the agent to visit the targets without considering the task duration, i.e., the amount of time needed for an agent to execute the task (such as picking an item) at a target location. MCPF is NP-hard to solve to optimality, and the inclusion of task duration further complicates the problem. This paper investigates heterogeneous task duration, where the duration can be different with respect to both the agents and targets. We develop two methods, where the first method post-processes the paths planned by any MCPF planner to include the task duration and has no solution optimality guarantee; and the second method considers task duration during planning and is able to ensure solution optimality. The numerical and simulation results show that our methods can handle up to 20 agents and 50 targets in the presence of task duration, and can execute the paths subject to robot motion disturbance.

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks meticulously generate minuscule, imperceptible perturbations to images to deceive neural networks. Counteracting these, adversarial purification methods seek to transform adversarial input samples into clean output images to defend against adversarial attacks. Nonetheless, extent generative models fail to effectively eliminate adversarial perturbations, yielding less-than-ideal purification results. We emphasize the potential threat of residual adversarial perturbations to target models, quantitatively establishing a relationship between perturbation scale and attack capability. Notably, the residual perturbations on the purified image primarily stem from the same-position patch and similar patches of the adversarial sample. We propose a novel adversarial purification approach named Information Mask Purification (IMPure), aims to extensively eliminate adversarial perturbations. To obtain an adversarial sample, we first mask part of the patches information, then reconstruct the patches to resist adversarial perturbations from the patches. We reconstruct all patches in parallel to obtain a cohesive image. Then, in order to protect the purified samples against potential similar regional perturbations, we simulate this risk by randomly mixing the purified samples with the input samples before inputting them into the feature extraction network. Finally, we establish a combined constraint of pixel loss and perceptual loss to augment the model's reconstruction adaptability. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset with three classifier models demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results against nine adversarial attack methods.

Inspired by the statistical insight that temporal features of abnormal events often exhibit outlier characteristics, we propose a novel method, BN-WVAD, which incorporates BatchNorm into WVAD. In the proposed BN-WVAD, we leverage the Divergence of Feature from Mean vector (DFM) of BatchNorm as a reliable abnormality criterion to discern potential abnormal snippets in abnormal videos. The proposed DFM criterion is also discriminative for anomaly recognition and more resilient to label noise, serving as the additional anomaly score to amend the prediction of the anomaly classifier that is susceptible to noisy labels. Moreover, a batch-level selection strategy is devised to filter more abnormal snippets in videos where more abnormal events occur.

In this attack, adversaries aim to determine whether a particular point was used during the training of a target model. This paper proposes a new method to gauge a data point's membership in a model's training set. Instead of correlating loss with membership, as is traditionally done, we have leveraged the fact that training examples generally exhibit higher confidence values when classified into their actual class. During training, the model is essentially being 'fit' to the training data and might face particular difficulties in generalization to unseen data. This asymmetry leads to the model achieving higher confidence on the training data as it exploits the specific patterns and noise present in the training data. Our proposed approach leverages the confidence values generated by the machine learning model. These confidence values provide a probabilistic measure of the model's certainty in its predictions and can further be used to infer the membership of a given data point. Additionally, we also introduce another variant of our method that allows us to carry out this attack without knowing the ground truth(true class) of a given data point, thus offering an edge over existing label-dependent attack methods.

Existing practical range filters have addressed this problem heuristically, resulting in high false positive rates and query times when dealing with adversarial inputs, such as in the common scenario where queries are correlated with the keys. We introduce Grafite, a novel range filter that solves these issues with a simple design and clear theoretical guarantees that hold regardless of the input data and query distribution: given a fixed space budget of $B$ bits per key, the query time is $O(1)$, and the false positive probability is upper bounded by $\\ell/2^{B-2}$, where $\\ell$ is the query range size. Our experimental evaluation shows that Grafite is the only range filter to date to achieve robust and predictable false positive rates across all combinations of datasets, query workloads, and range sizes, while providing faster queries and construction times, and dominating all competitors in the case of correlated queries. As a further contribution, we introduce a very simple heuristic range filter whose performance on uncorrelated queries is very close to or better than the one achieved by the best heuristic range filters proposed in the literature so far.

One of the key benefits of using data augmentation is in achieving sample efficiency or learning effectively when we have only a small amount of training data. We propose supervised and unsupervised data augmentation schemes by creating training data using parts of the relevant documents in the query-document pairs. We then adapt a family of contrastive losses for the document ranking task that can exploit the augmented data to learn an effective ranking model. Our extensive experiments on subsets of the MS MARCO and TREC-DL test sets show that data augmentation, along with the ranking-adapted contrastive losses, results in performance improvements under most dataset sizes. Apart from sample efficiency, we conclusively show that data augmentation results in robust models when transferred to out-of-domain benchmarks. Our performance improvements in in-domain and more prominently in out-of-domain benchmarks show that augmentation regularizes the ranking model and improves its robustness and generalization capability.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) techniques aim to identify and localize anomalies without relying on annotations, only leveraging a model trained on a dataset known to be free of anomalies. Diffusion models learn to modify inputs $x$ to increase the probability of it belonging to a desired distribution, i.e., they model the score function $\\nabla_x \\log p(x)$. Such a score function is potentially relevant for UAD, since $\\nabla_x \\log p(x)$ is itself a pixel-wise anomaly score. However, diffusion models are trained to invert a corruption process based on Gaussian noise and the learned score function is unlikely to generalize to medical anomalies. This work addresses the problem of how to learn a score function relevant for UAD and proposes DISYRE: Diffusion-Inspired SYnthetic REstoration. We retain the diffusion-like pipeline but replace the Gaussian noise corruption with a gradual, synthetic anomaly corruption so the learned score function generalizes to medical, naturally occurring anomalies. We evaluate DISYRE on three common Brain MRI UAD benchmarks and substantially outperform other methods in two out of the three tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Photonic Spiking Neural Networks (PSNN) composed of the co-integrated CMOS and photonic elements can offer low loss, low power, highly-parallel, and high-throughput computing for brain-inspired neuromorphic systems. In addition, heterogeneity of neuron dynamics can also bring greater diversity and expressivity to brain-inspired networks, potentially allowing for the implementation of complex functions with fewer neurons. In this paper, we design, fabricate, and experimentally demonstrate an optoelectronic spiking neuron that can simultaneously achieve high programmability for heterogeneous biological neural networks and maintain high-speed computing. We demonstrate that our neuron can be programmed to tune four essential parameters of neuron dynamics under 1GSpike/s input spiking pattern signals. A single neuron circuit can be tuned to output three spiking patterns, including chattering behaviors. The PSNN consisting of the optoelectronic spiking neuron and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) mesh synaptic network achieves 89.3% accuracy on the Iris dataset. Our neuron power consumption is 1.18 pJ/spike output, mainly limited by the power efficiency of the vertical-cavity-lasers, optical coupling efficiency, and the 45 nm CMOS platform used in this experiment, and is predicted to achieve 36.84 fJ/spike output with a 7 nm CMOS platform (e.g. ASAP7) integrated with silicon photonics containing on-chip micron-scale lasers.

    "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, which aims to estimate the probability of a user clicking on an item, is a key task in online advertising. Numerous existing CTR models concentrate on modeling the feature interactions within a solitary domain, thereby rendering them inadequate for fulfilling the requisites of multi-domain recommendations in real industrial scenarios. Some recent approaches propose intricate architectures to enhance knowledge sharing and augment model training across multiple domains. However, these approaches encounter difficulties when being transferred to new recommendation domains, owing to their reliance on the modeling of ID features (e.g., item id). To address the above issue, we propose the Universal Feature Interaction Network (UFIN) approach for CTR prediction. UFIN exploits textual data to learn universal feature interactions that can be effectively transferred across diverse domains. For learning universal feature representations, we regard the text and feature as two different modalities and propose an encoder-decoder network founded on a Large Language Model (LLM) to enforce the transfer of data from the text modality to the feature modality. Building upon the above foundation, we further develop a mixtureof-experts (MoE) enhanced adaptive feature interaction model to learn transferable collaborative patterns across multiple domains. Furthermore, we propose a multi-domain knowledge distillation framework to enhance feature interaction learning. Based on the above methods, UFIN can effectively bridge the semantic gap to learn common knowledge across various domains, surpassing the constraints of ID-based models. Extensive experiments conducted on eight datasets show the effectiveness of UFIN, in both multidomain and cross-platform settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/UFIN. ",

We introduce a simple and scalable approach to resolve translation ambiguity by incorporating a small amount of extra-sentential context in neural \\mt. Our approach requires no sense annotation and no change to standard model architectures. Since actual document context is not available for the vast majority of \\mt training data, we collect related sentences for each input to construct pseudo-documents. Salient words from pseudo-documents are then encoded as a prefix to each source sentence to condition the generation of the translation. To evaluate, we release \\docmucow, a challenge set for translation disambiguation based on the English-German \\mucow \\cite{raganato-etal-2020-evaluation} augmented with document IDs. Extensive experiments show that our method translates ambiguous source words better than strong sentence-level baselines and comparable document-level baselines while reducing training costs. ",

Recent work utilizes pedestrian character information, \\textit{i.e.}, action and appearance, to improve the learned trajectory embedding and achieves state-of-the-art performance. However, it neglects the invalid and negative pedestrian character information, which is harmful to trajectory representation and thus leads to performance degradation. To address this issue, we present a two-stream sparse-character-based network~(TSNet) for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Specifically, TSNet learns the negative-removed characters in the sparse character representation stream to improve the trajectory embedding obtained in the trajectory representation stream. Moreover, to model the negative-removed characters, we propose a novel sparse character graph, including the sparse category and sparse temporal character graphs, to learn the different effects of various characters in category and temporal dimensions, respectively. Extensive experiments on two first-person view datasets, PIE and JAAD, show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, ablation studies demonstrate different effects of various characters and prove that TSNet outperforms approaches without eliminating negative characters. ",

Currently, the focus of DOEs primarily revolves around active power exports of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) generation, often neglecting the impact of demand response (DR). This paper presents a two-stage, coordinated approach for residential DR participation in electricity markets under the DOE framework. In the first stage, the distribution network service provider (DNSP) adopts a convex hull technique to establish DOEs at each customer point-of-connection (POC). In the second stage, the demand response aggregator (DRA) utilises DOEs assigned by the DNSP to develop a hierarchical control scheme for tracking a load set-point signal without jeopardising network statutory limits. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in a practical setting, software-in-the-loop (SIL) tests are performed in a grid simulator, considering a real residential feeder with realistic household load and generation profiles. Simulation validations suggest that the DRA can provide precise DR while honouring network statutory limits and maintaining end-user thermal comfort. Furthermore, the overall approach is compliant with the market dispatch interval and preserves end-user data privacy. ",

However, it is impossible to install rain gauges on every corner. Spatial interpolation is a common way to infer rainfall distribution based on available raingauge data. However, the existing works rely on some unrealistic pre-settings to capture spatial correlations, which limits their performance in real scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose the SSIN, which is a novel data-driven self-supervised learning framework for rainfall spatial interpolation by mining latent spatial patterns from historical observation data. Inspired by the Cloze task and BERT, we fully consider the characteristics of spatial interpolation and design the SpaFormer model based on the Transformer architecture as the core of SSIN. Our main idea is: by constructing rich self-supervision signals via random masking, SpaFormer can learn informative embeddings for raw data and then adaptively model spatial correlations based on rainfall spatial context. Extensive experiments on two real-world raingauge datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions. In addition, we take traffic spatial interpolation as another use case to further explore the performance of our method, and SpaFormer achieves the best performance on one large real-world traffic dataset, which further confirms the effectiveness and generality of our method.

EAFP-Med can efficiently extract lesion features of different scales from a diverse range of medical images based on prompts while being flexible and not limited by specific imaging techniques.

We have compared our method to nine state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that EAFP-Med ST achieves the best performance on all three datasets (chest X-ray images, cranial magnetic resonance imaging images, and skin images). EAFP-Med can efficiently extract lesion features from various medical images based on prompts, enhancing the model's performance.

    "abstract": "Human albumin is essential for indicating the body's overall health. Accurately predicting plasma albumin levels and determining appropriate doses are urgent clinical challenges, particularly in critically ill patients, to maintain optimal blood levels. However, human albumin prediction is non-trivial that has to leverage the dynamics of biochemical markers as well as the experience of treating patients. Moreover, the problem of distribution shift is often encountered in real clinical data, which may lead to a decline in the model prediction performance and reduce the reliability of the model's application. In this paper, we propose a framework named Out-of-Distribution Generalized Dynamic Graph Neural Network for Human Albumin Prediction (DyG-HAP), which is able to provide accurate albumin predictions for Intensity Care Unit (ICU) patients during hospitalization. We first model human albumin prediction as a dynamic graph regression problem to model the dynamics and patient relationship. Then, we propose a disentangled dynamic graph attention mechanism to capture and disentangle the patterns whose relationship to labels under distribution shifts is invariant and variant respectively. Last, we propose an invariant dynamic graph regression method to encourage the model to rely on invariant patterns to make predictions. Moreover, we propose a dataset named Albumin level testing and nutritional dosing data for Intensive Care (ANIC) for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to several baseline methods in human albumin prediction. ",

Studies have shown that incorporating phonetic information into speaker embedding can improve the performance of text-independent SV. Inspired by this observation, we propose a joint-training speech recognition and speaker recognition (JTSS) framework to exploit phonetic content for far-field SV. The framework encourages speaker embeddings to preserve phonetic information by matching the frame-based feature maps of a speaker embedding network with wav2vec's vectors. The intuition is that phonetic information can preserve low-level acoustic dynamics with speaker information and thus partly compensate for the degradation due to noise and reverberation. Results show that the proposed framework outperforms the standard speaker embedding on the VOiCES Challenge 2019 evaluation set and the VoxCeleb1 test set. This indicates that leveraging phonetic information under far-field conditions is effective for learning robust speaker representations. ",

In MRL research, scene maps are represented in various forms, and they determine how MRL methods work and even how MRL methods perform. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing surveys do not provide systematic reviews of MRL from the respective of map. This survey fills the gap by comprehensively reviewing MRL methods employing monocular cameras as main sensors, promoting further research. 1) We commence by delving into the problem definition of MRL and exploring current challenges, while also comparing ours with with previous published surveys. 2) MRL methods are then categorized into five classes according to the representation forms of utilized map, i.e., geo-tagged frames, visual landmarks, point clouds, and vectorized semantic map, and we review the milestone MRL works of each category. 3) To quantitatively and fairly compare MRL methods with various map, we also review some public datasets and provide the performances of some typical MRL methods. The strengths and weakness of different types of MRL methods are analyzed. 4) We finally introduce some topics of interest in this field and give personal opinions.

We propose a high-order symmetric weighted interior penalty scheme that supports general polytopal grids and is robust with respect to strong heteorgeneities in the model coefficients. We focus on the treatment of the non-linear convective transport term in the energy conservation equation and we propose suitable stabilization techniques that make the scheme robust for advection-dominated regimes. The stability analysis of the problem and the convergence of the fixed-point linearization strategy are addressed theoretically under mild requirements on the problem's data. A complete set of numerical simulations is presented in order to assess the convergence and robustness properties of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "In the current demand for automation in the agro-food industry, accurately detecting and localizing relevant objects in 3D is essential for successful robotic operations. However, this is a challenge due the presence of occlusions. Multi-view perception approaches allow robots to overcome occlusions, but a tracking component is needed to associate the objects detected by the robot over multiple viewpoints. Most multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms are designed for high frame rate sequences and struggle with the occlusions generated by robots' motions and 3D environments. In this paper, we introduce MOT-DETR, a novel approach to detect and track objects in 3D over time using a combination of convolutional networks and transformers. Our method processes 2D and 3D data, and employs a transformer architecture to perform data fusion. We show that MOT-DETR outperforms state-of-the-art multi-object tracking methods. Furthermore, we prove that MOT-DETR can leverage 3D data to deal with long-term occlusions and large frame-to-frame distances better than state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show how our method is resilient to camera pose noise that can affect the accuracy of point clouds.

However, due to the fact that they can only manipulate input to see changes in output, they suffer from weak performance when used with complex model architectures.

In this work, we present a framework for using sampling-based explanation models in a computer vision context by body part relevance assessment for pedestrian detection. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sampling-based method similar to KernelSHAP that shows more robustness for lower sampling sizes and, thus, is more efficient for explainability analyses on large-scale datasets.

Here, we take an information theoretic approach to assess the efficiency of the representations induced by category learning. We show that one can decompose the relevant Bayesian cost into two components, one for the coding part and one for the decoding part. Minimizing the coding cost implies maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural activities. We analytically show that this mutual information can be written as the sum of two terms that can be interpreted as (i) finding an appropriate representation space, and, (ii) building a representation with the appropriate metrics, based on the neural Fisher information on this space. One main consequence is that category learning induces an expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. Finally, we provide numerical illustrations that show how Fisher information of the coding neural population aligns with the boundaries between categories. ",

Thus the trade-off between fairness, privacy and performance of ML models emerges, and practitioners need a way of quantifying this trade-off to enable deployment decisions. In this work we interpret this trade-off as a multi-objective optimization problem, and propose PFairDP, a pipeline that uses Bayesian optimization for discovery of Pareto-optimal points between fairness, privacy and utility of ML models. We show how PFairDP can be used to replicate known results that were achieved through manual constraint setting process.

Recent studies have demonstrated the capability of AI methods for accurate and early diagnosis of lung cancer from routine scans. However, this evidence has not translated into clinical practice with one barrier being a lack of interpretable models. This study investigates the application Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), a type of generative AI model, to lung cancer lesions. Proposed models were trained on lesions extracted from 3D CT scans in the LIDC-IDRI public dataset. Latent vector representations of 2D slices produced by the VAEs were explored through clustering to justify their quality and used in an MLP classifier model for lung cancer diagnosis, the best model achieved state-of-the-art metrics of AUC 0.98 and 93.1% accuracy. Cluster analysis shows the VAE latent space separates the dataset of malignant and benign lesions based on meaningful feature components including tumour size, shape, patient and malignancy class. We also include a comparative analysis of the standard Gaussian VAE (GVAE) and the more recent Dirichlet VAE (DirVAE), which replaces the prior with a Dirichlet distribution to encourage a more explainable latent space with disentangled feature representation. Finally, we demonstrate the potential for latent space traversals corresponding to clinically meaningful feature changes. ",

Motivated by many applications in which this differentiation is pivotal, we overcome this limitation by learning a block-sparse, frequency-dependent, partial correlation graph, in which layers correspond to different frequency bands, and partial correlations can occur over just a few layers. To this aim, we formulate and solve two nonconvex learning problems: the first has a closed-form solution and is suitable when there is prior knowledge about the number of partial correlations; the second hinges on an iterative solution based on successive convex approximation, and is effective for the general case where no prior knowledge is available. Numerical results on synthetic data show that the proposed methods outperform the current state of the art. Finally, the analysis of financial time series confirms that partial correlations exist only within a few frequency bands, underscoring how our methods enable the gaining of valuable insights that would be undetected without discriminating along the frequency domain.

    "abstract": "Large pre-trained vision models achieve impressive success in computer vision. However, fully fine-tuning large models for downstream tasks, particularly in video understanding, can be prohibitively computationally expensive. Recent studies turn their focus towards efficient image-to-video transfer learning. Nevertheless, existing efficient fine-tuning methods lack attention to training memory usage and exploration of transferring a larger model to the video domain. In this paper, we present a novel Spatial-Temporal Side Network for memory-efficient fine-tuning large image models to video understanding, named Side4Video. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight spatial-temporal side network attached to the frozen vision model, which avoids the backpropagation through the heavy pre-trained model and utilizes multi-level spatial features from the original image model. Extremely memory-efficient architecture enables our method to reduce 75% memory usage than previous adapter-based methods. In this way, we can transfer a huge ViT-E (4.4B) for video understanding tasks which is 14x larger than ViT-L (304M). Our approach achieves remarkable performance on various video datasets across unimodal and cross-modal tasks (i.e., action recognition and text-video retrieval), especially in Something-Something V1&V2 (67.3% & 74.6%), Kinetics-400 (88.6%), MSR-VTT (52.3%), MSVD (56.1%) and VATEX (68.8%).

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the \\textit{graph condensation} problem by compressing the large, complex graph into a concise, synthetic representation that preserves the most essential and discriminative information of structure and features. We seminally propose the concept of Shock Absorber (a type of perturbation) that enhances the robustness and stability of the original graphs against changes in an adversarial training fashion. Concretely, (I) we forcibly match the gradients between pre-selected graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on a synthetic, simplified graph and the original training graph at regularly spaced intervals. (II) Before each update synthetic graph point, a Shock Absorber serves as a gradient attacker to maximize the distance between the synthetic dataset and the original graph by selectively perturbing the parts that are underrepresented or insufficiently informative. We iteratively repeat the above two processes (I and II) in an adversarial training fashion to maintain the highly-informative context without losing correlation with the original dataset. More importantly, our shock absorber and the synthesized graph parallelly share the backward process in a free training manner. Compared to the original adversarial training, it introduces almost no additional time overhead. We validate our framework across 8 datasets (3 graph and 5 node classification datasets) and achieve prominent results: for example, on Cora, Citeseer and Ogbn-Arxiv, we can gain nearly 1.13% to 5.03% improvements compare with SOTA models. Moreover, our algorithm adds only about 0.2% to 2.2% additional time overhead over Flicker, Citeseer and Ogbn-Arxiv. Compared to the general adversarial training, our approach improves time efficiency by nearly 4-fold. ",

    "abstract": "Modern machine learning systems use models trained on ever-growing corpora. Typically, metadata such as ownership, access control, or licensing information is ignored during training. Instead, to mitigate privacy risks, we rely on generic techniques such as dataset sanitization and differentially private model training, with inherent privacy/utility trade-offs that hurt model performance. Moreover, these techniques have limitations in scenarios where sensitive information is shared across multiple participants and fine-grained access control is required. By ignoring metadata, we therefore miss an opportunity to better address security, privacy, and confidentiality challenges. In this paper, we take an information flow control perspective to describe machine learning systems, which allows us to leverage metadata such as access control policies and define clear-cut privacy and confidentiality guarantees with interpretable information flows. Under this perspective, we contrast two different approaches to achieve user-level non-interference: 1) fine-tuning per-user models, and 2) retrieval augmented models that access user-specific datasets at inference time. We compare these two approaches to a trivially non-interfering zero-shot baseline using a public model and to a baseline that fine-tunes this model on the whole corpus. We evaluate trained models on two datasets of scientific articles and demonstrate that retrieval augmented architectures deliver the best utility, scalability, and flexibility while satisfying strict non-interference guarantees.

This strategy results in a more robust and accurate calibration that is less prone to failure. We demonstrate that our approach works on outdoor urban scenes by validating it on multiple established driving datasets.

While contrastively trained VLMs show impressive zero-shot generalization performance, their effectiveness is limited when dealing with diverse domains during training and testing. Existing prompt learning techniques overlook the importance of incorporating domain and content information into the prompts, which results in a drop in performance while dealing with such multi-domain data. To address these challenges, we propose a solution that ensures domain-invariant prompt learning while enhancing the expressiveness of visual features. We observe that CLIP's vision encoder struggles to identify contextual image information, particularly when image patches are jumbled up. This issue is especially severe in optical remote sensing images, where land-cover classes exhibit well-defined contextual appearances. To this end, we introduce C-SAW, a method that complements CLIP with a self-supervised loss in the visual space and a novel prompt learning technique that emphasizes both visual domain and content-specific features. We keep the CLIP backbone frozen and introduce a small set of projectors for both the CLIP encoders to train C-SAW contrastively. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of C-SAW across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and different generalization tasks. ",

Bayesian Neural Networks (BayNNs) with Dropout as an approximation offer a systematic approach to quantifying uncertainty, but they inherently suffer from high hardware overhead in terms of power, memory, and computation. Thus, the applicability of BayNNs to edge devices with limited resources or to high-performance applications is challenging. Some of the inherent costs of BayNNs can be reduced by accelerating them in hardware on a Computation-In-Memory (CIM) architecture with spintronic memories and binarizing their parameters. However, numerous stochastic units are required to implement conventional dropout-based BayNN. In this paper, we propose the Scale Dropout, a novel regularization technique for Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), and Monte Carlo-Scale Dropout (MC-Scale Dropout)-based BayNNs for efficient uncertainty estimation. Our approach requires only one stochastic unit for the entire model, irrespective of the model size, leading to a highly scalable Bayesian NN. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Spintronic memory-based CIM architecture for the proposed BayNN that achieves more than $100\\times$ energy savings compared to the state-of-the-art. We validated our method to show up to a $1\\%$ improvement in predictive performance and superior uncertainty estimates compared to related works. ",

    "abstract": "Screaming-channel attacks enable Electromagnetic (EM) Side-Channel Attacks (SCAs) at larger distances due to higher EM leakage energies than traditional SCAs, relaxing the requirement of close access to the victim. This attack can be mounted on devices integrating Radio Frequency (RF) modules on the same die as digital circuits, where the RF can unintentionally capture, modulate, amplify, and transmit the leakage along with legitimate signals. Leakage results from digital switching activity, so the hypothesis of previous works was that this leakage would appear at multiples of the digital clock frequency, i.e., harmonics. This work demonstrates that compromising signals appear not only at the harmonics and that leakage at non-harmonics can be exploited for successful attacks. Indeed, the transformations undergone by the leaked signal are complex due to propagation effects through the substrate and power and ground planes, so the leakage also appears at other frequencies. We first propose two methodologies to locate frequencies that contain leakage and demonstrate that it appears at non-harmonic frequencies. Then, our experimental results show that screaming-channel attacks at non-harmonic frequencies can be as successful as at harmonics when retrieving a 16-byte AES key. As the RF spectrum is polluted by interfering signals, we run experiments and show successful attacks in a more realistic, noisy environment where harmonic frequencies are contaminated by multi-path fading and interference. These attacks at non-harmonic frequencies increase the attack surface by providing attackers with an increased number of potential frequencies where attacks can succeed. ",

    "abstract": "This article introduces a modular robust subsystem-based adaptive (RSBA) control design with a new stability analysis for a class of uncertain interconnected systems with unknown modeling errors and interactions. First, we propose a nonlinear state observer for this class of systems that ensures uniformly exponential convergence of the estimation error by utilizing a new adaptive term, extending the conventional continuous Luenberger concept. Second, we introduce a novel adaptive subsystem-based control strategy for trajectory tracking, which incorporates an interesting term called the \"stability connector\", designed to capture dynamic interactions among subsystems during stability analysis, preventing excessive complexity as the system order increases. This represents the first instance of this term allowing modular control with exponential and uniform convergence rates, effectively handling unknown non-triangular nonlinearities. In addition to rigorous theoretical proofs by the Lyapunov theory, two complex systems are explored in simulations to confirm the merits of the suggested control schemes. ",

Among several possible approaches, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) has emerged as a promising method to address a wide range of complex optimization problems like power control. However, the seamless application of MADRL to a variety of network optimization problems faces several challenges related to convergence. In this paper, we present the use of graphs as communication-inducing structures among distributed agents as an effective means to mitigate these challenges. Specifically, we harness graph neural networks (GNNs) as neural architectures for policy parameterization to introduce a relational inductive bias in the collective decision-making process. Most importantly, we focus on modeling the dynamic interactions among sets of neighboring agents through the introduction of innovative methods for defining a graph-induced framework for integrated communication and learning. Finally, the superior generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology to larger networks and to networks with different user categories is verified through simulations. ",

We design three attacks, namely free rider attacks, Byzantine data poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks. The simulation results show that the designed attacks can degrade the network performance and lead to lower energy-efficiency. Moreover, we also explore possible ways to mitigate the above attacks.

    "abstract": "With the rise of Web 2.0 platforms such as online social media, people's private information, such as their location, occupation and even family information, is often inadvertently disclosed through online discussions. Therefore, it is important to detect such unwanted privacy disclosures to help alert people affected and the online platform. In this paper, privacy disclosure detection is modeled as a multi-label text classification (MLTC) problem, and a new privacy disclosure detection model is proposed to construct an MLTC classifier for detecting online privacy disclosures. This classifier takes an online post as the input and outputs multiple labels, each reflecting a possible privacy disclosure. The proposed presentation method combines three different sources of information, the input text itself, the label-to-text correlation and the label-to-label correlation. A double-attention mechanism is used to combine the first two sources of information, and a graph convolutional network (GCN) is employed to extract the third source of information that is then used to help fuse features extracted from the first two sources of information. Our extensive experimental results, obtained on a public dataset of privacy-disclosing posts on Twitter, demonstrated that our proposed privacy disclosure detection method significantly and consistently outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in terms of all key performance indicators.

    "abstract": "Many early neural Information Retrieval (NeurIR) methods are re-rankers that rely on a traditional first-stage retriever due to expensive query time computations. Recently, representation-based retrievers have gained much attention, which learns query representation and document representation separately, making it possible to pre-compute document representations offline and reduce the workload at query time. Both dense and sparse representation-based retrievers have been explored. However, these methods focus on finding the representation that best represents a text (aka metric learning) and the actual retrieval function that is responsible for similarity matching between query and document is kept at a minimum by using dot product. One drawback is that unlike traditional term-level inverted index, the index formed by these embeddings cannot be easily re-used by another retrieval method. Another drawback is that keeping the interaction at minimum hurts retrieval effectiveness. On the contrary, interaction-based retrievers are known for their better retrieval effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel SEgment-based Neural Indexing method, SEINE, which provides a general indexing framework that can flexibly support a variety of interaction-based neural retrieval methods. We emphasize on a careful decomposition of common components in existing neural retrieval methods and propose to use segment-level inverted index to store the atomic query-document interaction values. Experiments on LETOR MQ2007 and MQ2008 datasets show that our indexing method can accelerate multiple neural retrieval methods up to 28-times faster without sacrificing much effectiveness. ",

This generalizes the applicability of PINNs not only to smoothly deformed domains, but also to lower-dimensional manifolds and allows for direct shape optimization while training the network. We demonstrate the effectivity of our approach on several problems: (i) Eikonal equation on Archimedean spiral, (ii) Poisson problem on surface manifold, (iii) Incompressible Stokes flow in deformed tube, and (iv) Shape optimization with Laplace operator. Through these examples, we demonstrate the enhanced flexibility over traditional PINNs, especially under geometric variations.

In this work, we explore whether over-squashing can be mitigated through the embedding space of the GNN. In particular, we consider the generalization of Hyperbolic GNNs (HGNNs) to Riemannian manifolds of variable curvature in which the geometry of the embedding space is faithful to the graph's topology. We derive bounds on the sensitivity of the node features in these Riemannian GNNs as the number of layers increases, which yield promising theoretical and empirical results for alleviating over-squashing in graphs with negative curvature.

However, designing the optimal neural network (NN) architecture for CSI feedback can be a laborious and time-consuming process. Manual design can be prohibitively expensive for customizing NNs to different scenarios. This paper proposes using neural architecture search (NAS) to automate the generation of scenario-customized CSI feedback NN architectures, thereby maximizing the potential of deep learning in exclusive environments. By employing automated machine learning and gradient-descent-based NAS, an efficient and cost-effective architecture design process is achieved. The proposed approach leverages implicit scene knowledge, integrating it into the scenario customization process in a data-driven manner, and fully exploits the potential of deep learning for each specific scenario. To address the issue of excessive search, early stopping and elastic selection mechanisms are employed, enhancing the efficiency of the proposed scheme. The experimental results demonstrate that the automatically generated architecture, known as Auto-CsiNet, outperforms manually-designed models in both reconstruction performance (achieving approximately a 14% improvement) and complexity (reducing it by approximately 50%). Furthermore, the paper analyzes the impact of the scenario on the NN architecture and its capacity. ",

    "abstract": "Globalization has had undesirable effects on the labor standards embedded in the products we consume. This paper proposes an ex-ante evaluation of supply chain due diligence regulations, such as the EU Corporate Sustainable Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). We construct a full-scale network model derived from structural business statistics of 30 million EU firms to quantify the likelihood of links to firms potentially involved in human rights abuses in the European supply chain. The 900 million supply links of these firms are modeled in a way that is consistent with multiregional input-output data, EU import data, and stylized facts of firm-level production networks. We find that this network exhibits a small world effect with three degrees of separation, meaning that most firms are no more than three steps away from each other in the network. Consequently we find that about 8.5% of EU companies are at risk of having child or forced labor in the first tier of their supply chains, about 82.4% are likely to have such offenders at the second tier and more than 99.1% have such offenders at the third tier. We also profile companies by country, sector, and size for the likelihood of having human rights violations or child and forced labor violations at a given tier in their supply chain, revealing considerable heterogeneity across EU companies. Our results show that supply chain due diligence regulations that focus on monitoring individual buyer-supplier links, as currently proposed in the CSDDD, are likely to be ineffective due to a high degree of redundancy and the fact that individual company value chains cannot be properly isolated from the global supply network. Rather, to maximize cost-effectiveness without compromising due diligence coverage, we suggest that regulations should focus on monitoring individual suppliers. ",

    "abstract": "Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle, impacting climate dynamics and necessitating accurate estimation for sustainable land and agricultural management. While traditional methods of SOC estimation face resolution and accuracy challenges, recent technological solutions harness remote sensing, machine learning, and high-resolution satellite mapping. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), especially when integrated with positional encoders, can capture complex relationships between soil and climate. Using the LUCAS database, this study compared four GNN operators in the positional encoder framework. Results revealed that the PESAGE and PETransformer models outperformed others in SOC estimation, indicating their potential in capturing the complex relationship between SOC and climate features. Our findings confirm the feasibility of applications of GNN architectures in SOC prediction, establishing a framework for future explorations of this topic with more advanced GNN models. ",

    "abstract": "DNN-based image classification models are susceptible to adversarial attacks. Most previous adversarial attacks do not focus on the interpretability of the generated adversarial examples, and we cannot gain insights into the mechanism of the target classifier from the attacks. Therefore, we propose Adversarial Doodles, which have interpretable shapes. We optimize black b\\'ezier curves to fool the target classifier by overlaying them onto the input image. By introducing random perspective transformation and regularizing the doodled area, we obtain compact attacks that cause misclassification even when humans replicate them by hand. Adversarial doodles provide describable and intriguing insights into the relationship between our attacks and the classifier's output. We utilize adversarial doodles and discover the bias inherent in the target classifier, such as \"We add two strokes on its head, a triangle onto its body, and two lines inside the triangle on a bird image. Then, the classifier misclassifies the image as a butterfly.\" ",

We consider fully connected feedforward networks with selected activation functions as well as residual neural networks. In numerical experiments, the proposed sensitivity-based layer insertion technique exhibits improved training decay, compared to not inserting the layer.

On the other hand, although Federated Learning (FL) provides some level of privacy by retaining the data at the local node, which executes a local training to enrich a global model, this scenario is still susceptible to privacy breaches as membership inference attacks. To provide a stronger level of privacy, this research deploys an experimental environment for FL with Differential Privacy (DP) using benchmark datasets. The obtained results show that the election of parameters and techniques of DP is central in the aforementioned trade-off between privacy and utility by means of a classification example. ",

    "abstract": "Identifying and resolving logic errors can be one of the most frustrating challenges for novices programmers. Unlike syntax errors, for which a compiler or interpreter can issue a message, logic errors can be subtle. In certain conditions, buggy code may even exhibit correct behavior -- in other cases, the issue might be about how a problem statement has been interpreted. Such errors can be hard to spot when reading the code, and they can also at times be missed by automated tests. There is great educational potential in automatically detecting logic errors, especially when paired with suitable feedback for novices. Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated surprising performance for a range of computing tasks, including generating and explaining code. These capabilities are closely linked to code syntax, which aligns with the next token prediction behavior of LLMs. On the other hand, logic errors relate to the runtime performance of code and thus may not be as well suited to analysis by LLMs. To explore this, we investigate the performance of two popular LLMs, GPT-3 and GPT-4, for detecting and providing a novice-friendly explanation of logic errors. We compare LLM performance with a large cohort of introductory computing students $(n=964)$ solving the same error detection task. Through a mixed-methods analysis of student and model responses, we observe significant improvement in logic error identification between the previous and current generation of LLMs, and find that both LLM generations significantly outperform students. We outline how such models could be integrated into computing education tools, and discuss their potential for supporting students when learning programming. ",

To this end, we propose a packet-level network intrusion detection solution that makes novel use of Recurrent Autoencoders to integrate an arbitrary-length sequence of packets into a more compact joint feature embedding, which is fed into a DNN-based classifier. To enable explainability and support real-time detections at micro-second speed, we further develop a Software-Hardware Co-Design approach to efficiently realize the proposed solution by converting the learned detection policies into decision trees and implementing them using an emerging architecture based on memristor devices. By jointly optimizing associated software and hardware constraints, we show that our approach leads to an extremely efficient, real-time solution with high detection accuracy at the packet level. Evaluation results on real-world datasets (e.g., UNSW and CIC-IDS datasets) demonstrate nearly three-nines detection accuracy with a substantial speedup of nearly four orders of magnitude. ",

As a remedy, causal sensitivity analysis is an important tool to draw causal conclusions under unobserved confounding with mathematical guarantees. In this paper, we propose NeuralCSA, a neural framework for generalized causal sensitivity analysis. Unlike previous work, our framework is compatible with (i) a large class of sensitivity models, including the marginal sensitivity model, f-sensitivity models, and Rosenbaum's sensitivity model; (ii) different treatment types (i.e., binary and continuous); and (iii) different causal queries, including (conditional) average treatment effects and simultaneous effects on multiple outcomes. The generality of \\frameworkname is achieved by learning a latent distribution shift that corresponds to a treatment intervention using two conditional normalizing flows. We provide theoretical guarantees that NeuralCSA is able to infer valid bounds on the causal query of interest and also demonstrate this empirically using both simulated and real-world data. ",

    "abstract": "Top-$k$ frequent items detection is a fundamental task in data stream mining. Many promising solutions are proposed to improve memory efficiency while still maintaining high accuracy for detecting the Top-$k$ items. Despite the memory efficiency concern, the users could suffer from privacy loss if participating in the task without proper protection, since their contributed local data streams may continually leak sensitive individual information. However, most existing works solely focus on addressing either the memory-efficiency problem or the privacy concerns but seldom jointly, which cannot achieve a satisfactory tradeoff between memory efficiency, privacy protection, and detection accuracy. In this paper, we present a novel framework HG-LDP to achieve accurate Top-$k$ item detection at bounded memory expense, while providing rigorous local differential privacy (LDP) protection. Specifically, we identify two key challenges naturally arising in the task, which reveal that directly applying existing LDP techniques will lead to an inferior ``accuracy-privacy-memory efficiency'' tradeoff. Therefore, we instantiate three advanced schemes under the framework by designing novel LDP randomization methods, which address the hurdles caused by the large size of the item domain and by the limited space of the memory. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to show that the proposed advanced schemes achieve a superior ``accuracy-privacy-memory efficiency'' tradeoff, saving $2300\\times$ memory over baseline methods when the item domain size is $41,270$.

In this survey, we focus on threat models targeting the learning process of FL systems. Based on the source and target of the attack, we categorize existing threat models into four types, Data to Model (D2M), Model to Data (M2D), Model to Model (M2M) and composite attacks. For each attack type, we discuss the defense strategies proposed, highlighting their effectiveness, assumptions and potential areas for improvement. Defense strategies have evolved from using a singular metric to excluding malicious clients, to employing a multifaceted approach examining client models at various phases. In this survey paper, our research indicates that the to-learn data, the learning gradients, and the learned model at different stages all can be manipulated to initiate malicious attacks that range from undermining model performance, reconstructing private local data, and to inserting backdoors. We have also seen these threat are becoming more insidious. While earlier studies typically amplified malicious gradients, recent endeavors subtly alter the least significant weights in local models to bypass defense measures. This literature review provides a holistic understanding of the current FL threat landscape and highlights the importance of developing robust, efficient, and privacy-preserving defenses to ensure the safe and trusted adoption of FL in real-world applications.

The proposed approach may be advantageous for the study of behavior resulting from large molecular weights. To create this fingerprint, we make use of two kinds of descriptors. First, we calculate certain geometric descriptors like Re2, Rg2 etc. and label them as Calculated Descriptors. Second, we generate a set of data-driven descriptors using an unsupervised autoencoder model and call them Learnt Descriptors. Using a combination of both of them, we are able to learn mappings from the structure to various properties of the polymer chain by training ML models. We test our fingerprint to predict the probability of occurrence of a configuration at equilibrium, which is approximated by a simple linear relationship between the instantaneous internal energy and equilibrium average internal energy.

    "abstract": "The field of opinion dynamics has evolved steadily since the earliest studies applying magnetic physics methods to better understand social opinion formation. However, in the real world, complete agreement of opinions is rare, and biaxial consensus, especially on social issues, is rare. To address this challenge, Ishii and Kawabata (2018) proposed an extended version of the Bounded Confidence Model that introduces new parameters indicating dissent and distrust, as well as the influence of mass media. Their model aimed to capture more realistic social opinion dynamics by introducing coefficients representing the degree of trust and distrust, rather than assuming convergence of opinions. In this paper, we propose a new approach to opinion dynamics based on this Trust-Distrust Model (TDM), applying the dimer allocation and Ising model. Our goal is to explore how the interaction between trust and distrust affects social opinion formation. In particular, we analyze through mathematical models how various external stimuli, such as mass media, third-party opinions, and economic and political factors, affect people's opinions. Our approach is to mathematically represent the dynamics of trust and distrust, which traditional models have not addressed. This theoretical framework provides new insights into the polarization of opinions, the process of consensus building, and how these are reflected in social behavior. In addition to developing the theoretical framework by applying the dimer configuration, the dimer model and the Ising model, this paper uses numerical simulations to show how the proposed model applies to actual social opinion formation. This research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of social opinion formation by providing new perspectives in the fields of social science, physics, and computational modeling. ",

In this paper, we explore the features determining whether the metric backbone, a subgraph capturing the structure of shortest paths across a network, allows reconstructing epidemic outbreaks. We find that both the relative size of the metric backbone, capturing the fraction of edges kept in such structure, and the distortion of semi-metric edges, quantifying how far those edges not included in the metric backbone are from their associated shortest path, shape the retrieval of Susceptible-Infected (SI) dynamics. We propose a new method to progressively dismantle networks relying on the semi-metric edge distortion, removing first those connections farther from those included in the metric backbone, i.e. those with highest semi-metric distortion values. We apply our method in both synthetic and real networks, finding that semi-metric distortion provides solid ground to preserve spreading dynamics and connectedness while sparsifying networks. ",

Understanding such nonlinear behavior has been a key challenge in predicting whether all oscillators in such a system will eventually synchronize. In this paper, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, such nonlinear behavior of coupled oscillators can be effectively linearized in certain latent dynamic spaces. The key insight is that there is a small number of `latent dynamics filters', each with a specific association with synchronizing and non-synchronizing dynamics on subgraphs so that any observed dynamics on subgraphs can be approximated by a suitable linear combination of such elementary dynamic patterns. Taking an ensemble of subgraph-level predictions provides an interpretable predictor for whether the system on the whole graph reaches global synchronization. We propose algorithms based on supervised matrix factorization to learn such latent dynamics filters. We demonstrate that our method performs competitively in synchronization prediction tasks against baselines and black-box classification algorithms, despite its simple and interpretable architecture.

The primary goal of this study is to rigorously control the risk of false detections by providing theoretically valid p-values to the CPs detected by RNN. To achieve this, we introduce a novel method based on the framework of Selective Inference (SI). SI enables valid inferences by conditioning on the event of hypothesis selection, thus mitigating selection bias.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has the potential to revolutionize medical practice by automating and performing important tasks like detecting and delineating the size and locations of cancers in medical images. However, most deep learning models rely on augmentation techniques that treat medical images as natural images. For contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) images in particular, the signals producing the voxel intensities have physical meaning, which is lost during preprocessing and augmentation when treating such images as natural images. To address this, we propose a novel preprocessing and intensity augmentation scheme inspired by how radiologists leverage multiple viewing windows when evaluating CT images. Our proposed method, window shifting, randomly places the viewing windows around the region of interest during training. This approach improves liver lesion segmentation performance and robustness on images with poorly timed contrast agent. Our method outperforms classical intensity augmentations as well as the intensity augmentation pipeline of the popular nn-UNet on multiple datasets. ",

Three relaxed sufficient conditions are introduced to mitigate computational complexity. The equivalence of these conditions in terms of feasibility, as well as their connections with existing robust stability results, are also established.

Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have become instrumental in this domain, particularly when combined with Optical Coherent Technology (OCT) imaging. We propose a novel method for efficient detection of eye diseases from OCT images. Our technique enables the classification of patients into disease free (normal eyes) or affected by specific conditions such as Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV), Diabetic Macular Edema (DME), or Drusen. In this work, we introduce an end to end web application that utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques for efficient eye disease prediction. The application allows patients to submit their raw OCT scanned images, which undergo segmentation using a trained custom UNet model. The segmented images are then fed into an ensemble model, comprising InceptionV3 and Xception networks, enhanced with a self attention layer. This self attention approach leverages the feature maps of individual models to achieve improved classification accuracy. The ensemble model's output is aggregated to predict and classify various eye diseases. Extensive experimentation and optimization have been conducted to ensure the application's efficiency and optimal performance. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurate eye disease prediction. The developed web application holds significant potential for early detection and timely intervention, thereby contributing to improved eye healthcare outcomes. ",

The paper presents a model that includes layers A and B with varying degrees of forgetting and dependence over time.

In addition, to discuss the formation of opinion clusters that have reinforcing or obstructive behaviors of forgetting and dependence and are conservative or brainwashing or detoxifying and less prone to filter bubbling, new clusters C and D that recommend, obstruct, block, or incite forgetting and dependence over time are Introduction. This introduction allows us to test hypotheses regarding the expansion of opinions in two dimensions over time and space, the state of development of opinion space, and the expansion of public opinion. Challenges in consensus building will be highlighted, emphasizing the dynamic nature of opinions and the need to consider factors such as dissent, distrust, and media influence. The paper proposes an extended framework that incorporates trust, distrust, and media influence into the consensus building model. We introduce network analysis using dimerizing as a method to gain deeper insights. In this context, we discuss network clustering, media influence, and consensus building. The location and distribution of dimers will be analyzed to gain insight into the structure and dynamics of the network. Dimertiling has been applied in various fields other than network analysis, such as physics and sociology.

Among the array of centroid-based clustering algorithms, the classic $k$-means algorithm, rooted in Lloyd's heuristic, takes center stage as one of the extensively employed techniques in the literature. Nonetheless, both $k$-means and its variants grapple with noteworthy limitations. These encompass a heavy reliance on initial cluster centroids, susceptibility to converging into local minima of the objective function, and sensitivity to outliers and noise in the data. When confronted with data containing noisy or outlier-laden observations, the Median-of-Means (MoM) estimator emerges as a stabilizing force for any centroid-based clustering framework. On a different note, a prevalent constraint among existing clustering methodologies resides in the prerequisite knowledge of the number of clusters prior to analysis. Utilizing model-based methodologies, such as Bayesian nonparametric models, offers the advantage of infinite mixture models, thereby circumventing the need for such requirements. Motivated by these facts, in this article, we present an efficient and automatic clustering technique by integrating the principles of model-based and centroid-based methodologies that mitigates the effect of noise on the quality of clustering while ensuring that the number of clusters need not be specified in advance. Statistical guarantees on the upper bound of clustering error, and rigorous assessment through simulated and real datasets suggest the advantages of our proposed method over existing state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.

While the materials science community achieved much progress in developing property models that predict well on average with respect to the training distribution, this form of in-distribution performance measurement is not directly coupled with the discovery reward. This is because an iterative discovery process has a shifting reward distribution that is over-proportionally determined by the model performance for exceptional materials. We demonstrate this problem using the example of bulk modulus maximization among double perovskite oxides. We find that the in-distribution predictive performance suggests random forests as superior to Gaussian process regression, while the results are inverse in terms of the discovery rewards. We argue that the lack of proper performance estimation methods from pre-computed data collections is a fundamental problem for improving data-driven materials discovery, and we propose a novel such estimator that, in contrast to na\\\"ive reward estimation, successfully predicts Gaussian processes with the \"expected improvement\" acquisition function as the best out of four options in our demonstrational study for double perovskites. Importantly, it does so without requiring the over thousand ab initio computations that were needed to confirm this prediction. ",

Although the spatial distribution of the microphones is advantageous, exploiting the spatial diversity for diarization and signal enhancement is challenging, because the microphones' positions are typically unknown, and the recorded signals are initially unsynchronized in general. Here, we approach these issues by first blindly synchronizing the signals and then estimating time differences of arrival (TDOAs). The TDOA information is exploited to estimate the speakers' activity, even in the presence of multiple speakers being simultaneously active. This speaker activity information serves as a guide for a spatial mixture model, on which basis the individual speaker's signals are extracted via beamforming. Finally, the extracted signals are forwarded to a speech recognizer. Additionally, a novel initialization scheme for spatial mixture models based on the TDOA estimates is proposed. Experiments conducted on real recordings from the LibriWASN data set have shown that our proposed system is advantageous compared to a system using a spatial mixture model, which does not make use of external diarization information.

We propose a novel two-stage network clustering method including a tensor-based initialization algorithm involving both node and sample splitting and a refinement procedure by likelihood-based Lloyd algorithm. Network clustering must be accompanied by node community detection. Our proposed algorithm achieves the minimax optimal network clustering error rate and allows extreme network sparsity under MMSBM. Numerical simulations and real data experiments both validate that our method outperforms existing methods. Oftentimes, the edges of networks carry count-type weights. We then extend our methodology and analysis framework to study the minimax optimal clustering error rate for mixture of discrete distributions including Binomial, Poisson, and multi-layer Poisson networks. The minimax optimal clustering error rates in these discrete mixtures all take the same exponential form characterized by the Renyi divergences. These optimal clustering error rates in discrete mixtures can also be achieved by our proposed two-stage clustering algorithm. ",

In the absence of fully sampled acquisitions, which can serve as ground truth data, training deep learning algorithms in a supervised manner to predict the underlying ground truth image becomes an impossible task. To address this limitation, self-supervised methods have emerged as a viable alternative, leveraging available subsampled k-space data to train deep learning networks for MRI reconstruction. Nevertheless, these self-supervised approaches often fall short when compared to supervised methodologies. In this paper, we introduce JSSL (Joint Supervised and Self-supervised Learning), a novel training approach for deep learning-based MRI reconstruction algorithms aimed at enhancing reconstruction quality in scenarios where target dataset(s) containing fully sampled k-space measurements are unavailable. Our proposed method operates by simultaneously training a model in a self-supervised learning setting, using subsampled data from the target dataset(s), and in a supervised learning manner, utilizing data from other datasets, referred to as proxy datasets, where fully sampled k-space data is accessible. To demonstrate the efficacy of JSSL, we utilized subsampled prostate parallel MRI measurements as the target dataset, while employing fully sampled brain and knee k-space acquisitions as proxy datasets. Our results showcase a substantial improvement over conventional self-supervised training methods, thereby underscoring the effectiveness of our joint approach. We provide a theoretical motivation for JSSL and establish a practical \"rule-of-thumb\" for selecting the most appropriate training approach for deep MRI reconstruction. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing has the potential to solve problems that are intractable for classical systems, yet the high error rates in contemporary quantum devices often exceed tolerable limits for useful algorithm execution. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) mitigates this by employing redundancy, distributing quantum information across multiple data qubits and utilizing syndrome qubits to monitor their states for errors. The syndromes are subsequently interpreted by a decoding algorithm to identify and correct errors in the data qubits. This task is complex due to the multiplicity of error sources affecting both data and syndrome qubits as well as syndrome extraction operations. Additionally, identical syndromes can emanate from different error sources, necessitating a decoding algorithm that evaluates syndromes collectively. Although machine learning (ML) decoders such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed, they often focus on local syndrome regions and require retraining when adjusting for different code distances. We introduce a transformer-based QEC decoder which employs self-attention to achieve a global receptive field across all input syndromes. It incorporates a mixed loss training approach, combining both local physical error and global parity label losses. Moreover, the transformer architecture's inherent adaptability to variable-length inputs allows for efficient transfer learning, enabling the decoder to adapt to varying code distances without retraining. Evaluation on six code distances and ten different error configurations demonstrates that our model consistently outperforms non-ML decoders, such as Union Find (UF) and Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM), and other ML decoders, thereby achieving best logical error rates. Moreover, the transfer learning can save over 10x of training cost. ",
