    "title": "Gaussian Differential Privacy on Riemannian Manifolds",
    "abstract": "We develop an advanced approach for extending Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) to general Riemannian manifolds. The concept of GDP stands out as a prominent privacy definition that strongly warrants extension to manifold settings, due to its central limit properties. By harnessing the power of the renowned Bishop-Gromov theorem in geometric analysis, we propose a Riemannian Gaussian distribution that integrates the Riemannian distance, allowing us to achieve GDP in Riemannian manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature. To the best of our knowledge, this work marks the first instance of extending the GDP framework to accommodate general Riemannian manifolds, encompassing curved spaces, and circumventing the reliance on tangent space summaries. We provide a simple algorithm to evaluate the privacy budget $\\mu$ on any one-dimensional manifold and introduce a versatile Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based algorithm to calculate $\\mu$ on any Riemannian manifold with constant curvature. Through simulations on one of the most prevalent manifolds in statistics, the unit sphere $S^d$, we demonstrate the superior utility of our Riemannian Gaussian mechanism in comparison to the previously proposed Riemannian Laplace mechanism for implementing GDP.

    "abstract": "Despite being (pre)trained on a massive amount of data, state-of-the-art video-language alignment models are not robust to semantically-plausible contrastive changes in the video captions. Our work addresses this by identifying a broad spectrum of contrast misalignments, such as replacing entities, actions, and flipping event order, which alignment models should be robust against. To this end, we introduce the VideoCon, a video-language alignment dataset constructed by a large language model that generates plausible contrast video captions and explanations for differences between original and contrast video captions. Then, a generative video-language model is finetuned with VideoCon to assess video-language entailment and generate explanations. Our VideoCon-based alignment model significantly outperforms current models. It exhibits a 12-point increase in AUC for the video-language alignment task on human-generated contrast captions. Finally, our model sets new state of the art zero-shot performance in temporally-extensive video-language tasks such as text-to-video retrieval (SSv2-Temporal) and video question answering (ATP-Hard). Moreover, our model shows superior performance on novel videos and human-crafted captions and explanations. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Hritikbansal/videocon. ",

    "title": "Zero-Shot Relational Learning on Temporal Knowledge Graphs with Large  Language Models",
    "abstract": "In recent years, modeling evolving knowledge over temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) has become a heated topic. Various methods have been proposed to forecast links on TKGs. Most of them are embedding-based, where hidden representations are learned to represent knowledge graph (KG) entities and relations based on the observed graph contexts. Although these methods show strong performance on traditional TKG forecasting (TKGF) benchmarks, they naturally face a strong challenge when they are asked to model the unseen zero-shot relations that has no prior graph context. In this paper, we try to mitigate this problem as follows. We first input the text descriptions of KG relations into large language models (LLMs) for generating relation representations, and then introduce them into embedding-based TKGF methods. LLM-empowered representations can capture the semantic information in the relation descriptions. This makes the relations, whether seen or unseen, with similar semantic meanings stay close in the embedding space, enabling TKGF models to recognize zero-shot relations even without any observed graph context. Experimental results show that our approach helps TKGF models to achieve much better performance in forecasting the facts with previously unseen relations, while still maintaining their ability in link forecasting regarding seen relations.

    "title": "Wildfire Smoke Detection with Cross Contrast Patch Embedding",
    "abstract": "The Transformer-based deep networks have increasingly shown significant advantages over CNNs. Some existing work has applied it in the field of wildfire recognition or detection. However, we observed that the vanilla Transformer is not friendly for extracting smoke features. Because low-level information such as color, transparency and texture is very important for smoke recognition, and transformer pays more attention to the semantic relevance between middle- or high-level features, and is not sensitive to the subtle changes of low-level features along the space. To solve this problem, we propose the Cross Contrast Patch Embedding(CCPE) module based on the Swin Transformer, which uses the multi-scales spatial frequency contrast information in both vertical and horizontal directions to improve the discrimination of the network on the underlying details. The fuzzy boundary of smoke makes the positive and negative label assignment for instances in a dilemma, which is another challenge for wildfires detection. To solve this problem, a Separable Negative Sampling Mechanism(SNSM) is proposed. By using two different negative instance sampling strategies on positive images and negative images respectively, the problem of supervision signal confusion caused by label diversity in the process of network training is alleviated. This paper also releases the RealFire Test, the largest real wildfire test set so far, to evaluate the proposed method and promote future research. It contains 50,535 images from 3,649 video clips. The proposed method has been extensively tested and evaluated on RealFire Test dataset, and has a significant performance improvement compared with the baseline detection models. ",

    "abstract": "The Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) has enhanced the performance of various downstream tasks in visual-language understanding. Most existing approaches encode images and videos into separate feature spaces, which are then fed as inputs to large language models. However, due to the lack of unified tokenization for images and videos, namely misalignment before projection, it becomes challenging for a Large Language Model (LLM) to learn multi-modal interactions from several poor projection layers. In this work, we unify visual representation into the language feature space to advance the foundational LLM towards a unified LVLM. As a result, we establish a simple but robust LVLM baseline, Video-LLaVA, which learns from a mixed dataset of images and videos, mutually enhancing each other. Video-LLaVA achieves superior performances on a broad range of 9 image benchmarks across 5 image question-answering datasets and 4 image benchmark toolkits. Additionally, our Video-LLaVA also outperforms Video-ChatGPT by 5.8%, 9.9%, 18.6%, and 10.1% on MSRVTT, MSVD, TGIF, and ActivityNet, respectively. Notably, extensive experiments demonstrate that Video-LLaVA mutually benefits images and videos within a unified visual representation, outperforming models designed specifically for images or videos.

    "abstract": "In this work, we introduce a novel approach based on algebraic topology to enhance graph convolution and attention modules by incorporating local topological properties of the data. To do so, we consider the framework of sheaf neural networks, which has been previously leveraged to incorporate additional structure into graph neural networks' features and construct more expressive, non-isotropic messages. Specifically, given an input simplicial complex (e.g. generated by the cliques of a graph or the neighbors in a point cloud), we construct its local homology sheaf, which assigns to each node the vector space of its local homology. The intermediate features of our networks live in these vector spaces and we leverage the associated sheaf Laplacian to construct more complex linear messages between them. Moreover, we extend this approach by considering the persistent version of local homology associated with a weighted simplicial complex (e.g., built from pairwise distances of nodes embeddings). This i) solves the problem of the lack of a natural choice of basis for the local homology vector spaces and ii) makes the sheaf itself differentiable, which enables our models to directly optimize the topology of their intermediate features.

Conventional methods like data augmentation, while effective to some extent, fall short in addressing unforeseen corruptions, limiting the adaptability of neural networks in real-world scenarios. In response, this paper introduces a novel paradigm known as the Mixture of Class-Specific Expert Architecture. The approach involves disentangling feature learning for individual classes, offering a nuanced enhancement in scalability and overall performance. By training dedicated network segments for each class and subsequently aggregating their outputs, the proposed architecture aims to mitigate vulnerabilities associated with common neural network structures. The study underscores the importance of comprehensive evaluation methodologies, advocating for the incorporation of benchmarks like the common corruptions benchmark. This inclusion provides nuanced insights into the vulnerabilities of neural networks, especially concerning their generalization capabilities and robustness to unforeseen distortions. The research aligns with the broader objective of advancing the development of highly robust learning systems capable of nuanced reasoning across diverse and challenging real-world scenarios. Through this contribution, the paper aims to foster a deeper understanding of neural network limitations and proposes a practical approach to enhance their resilience in the face of evolving and unpredictable conditions.

    "abstract": "Cyberattacks have grown into a major risk for organizations, with common consequences being data theft, sabotage, and extortion. Since preventive measures do not suffice to repel attacks, timely detection of successful intruders is crucial to stop them from reaching their final goals. For this purpose, many organizations utilize Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems to centrally collect security-related events and scan them for attack indicators using expert-written detection rules. However, as we show by analyzing a set of widespread SIEM detection rules, adversaries can evade almost half of them easily, allowing them to perform common malicious actions within an enterprise network without being detected. To remedy these critical detection blind spots, we propose the idea of adaptive misuse detection, which utilizes machine learning to compare incoming events to SIEM rules on the one hand and known-benign events on the other hand to discover successful evasions. Based on this idea, we present AMIDES, an open-source proof-of-concept adaptive misuse detection system. Using four weeks of SIEM events from a large enterprise network and more than 500 hand-crafted evasions, we show that AMIDES successfully detects a majority of these evasions without any false alerts. In addition, AMIDES eases alert analysis by assessing which rules were evaded. Its computational efficiency qualifies AMIDES for real-world operation and hence enables organizations to significantly reduce detection blind spots with moderate effort. ",

    "abstract": "The ever-growing textual records of contemporary social issues, often discussed online with moral rhetoric, present both an opportunity and a challenge for studying how moral concerns are debated in real life. Moral foundations theory is a taxonomy of intuitions widely used in data-driven analyses of online content, but current computational tools to detect moral foundations suffer from the incompleteness and fragility of their lexicons and from poor generalization across data domains. In this paper, we fine-tune a large language model to measure moral foundations in text based on datasets covering news media and long- and short-form online discussions. The resulting model, called Mformer, outperforms existing approaches on the same domains by 4--12% in AUC and further generalizes well to four commonly used moral text datasets, improving by up to 17% in AUC. We present case studies using Mformer to analyze everyday moral dilemmas on Reddit and controversies on Twitter, showing that moral foundations can meaningfully describe people's stance on social issues and such variations are topic-dependent. Pre-trained model and datasets are released publicly. We posit that Mformer will help the research community quantify moral dimensions for a range of tasks and data domains, and eventually contribute to the understanding of moral situations faced by humans and machines.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel data-driven approach to design a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) using a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that does not require a system model. The key contribution is to perform policy iteration (PI) by designing the policy evaluator as a two-layer quadratic neural network (QNN). This network is trained through convex optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a QNN trained through convex optimization is employed as the Q-function approximator (QFA). The main advantage is that the QNN's input-output mapping has an analytical expression as a quadratic form, which can then be used to obtain an analytical expression for policy improvement. This is in stark contrast to the available techniques in the literature that must train a second neural network to obtain policy improvement. The article establishes the convergence of the learning algorithm to the optimal control, provided the system is controllable and one starts from a stabilitzing policy. A quadrotor example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ",

Such systems easily overfit to specific targets and keywords, and evaluating them without considering distribution shifts that might occur between train and test data overestimates their benefit. We challenge hate speech models via new train-test splits of existing datasets that rely on the clustering of models' hidden representations. We present two split variants (Subset-Sum-Split and Closest-Split) that, when applied to two datasets using four pretrained models, reveal how models catastrophically fail on blind spots in the latent space. This result generalises when developing a split with one model and evaluating it on another. Our analysis suggests that there is no clear surface-level property of the data split that correlates with the decreased performance, which underscores that task difficulty is not always humanly interpretable. We recommend incorporating latent feature-based splits in model development and release two splits via the GenBench benchmark. ",

These attacks fall under the umbrella of front-running attacks. Therefore, total ordering is not strong enough to preserve application semantics. In this paper, we propose causality preserving total order as a solution to this problem. The resulting Blockchains will be stronger than traditional consensus based blockchains and will provide enhanced security ensuring correct application semantics in a Byzantine setting. ",

(2) It uses a training procedure tailored for sparse causal graphs, which are common in real-world scenarios. We first derive SDCD and prove its stability and correctness.

Supervised deep convolutional neural networks have been developed to automate pap smear screening and the results are promising. However, the interest in using only normal samples to train deep neural networks has increased owing to class imbalance problems and high-labeling costs that are both prevalent in healthcare. In this study, we introduce a method to learn explainable deep cervical cell representations for pap smear cytology images based on one class classification using variational autoencoders. Findings demonstrate that a score can be calculated for cell abnormality without training models with abnormal samples and localize abnormality to interpret our results with a novel metric based on absolute difference in cross entropy in agglomerative clustering. The best model that discriminates squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from normals gives 0.908 +- 0.003 area under operating characteristic curve (AUC) and one that discriminates high-grade epithelial lesion (HSIL) 0.920 +- 0.002 AUC. Compared to other clustering methods, our method enhances the V-measure and yields higher homogeneity scores, which more effectively isolate different abnormality regions, aiding in the interpretation of our results. Evaluation using in-house and additional open dataset show that our model can discriminate abnormality without the need of additional training of deep models. ",

The $\\kappa$-GHWT and the $\\kk$-HGLET both form redundant sets (i.e., dictionaries) of multiscale basis vectors and the corresponding expansion coefficients of a given signal. Our MHSNs use a layered structure analogous to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to cascade the moments of the modulus of the dictionary coefficients. The resulting features are invariant to reordering of the simplices (i.e., node permutation of the underlying graphs). Importantly, the use of multiscale basis dictionaries in our MHSNs admits a natural pooling operation that is akin to local pooling in CNNs, and which may be performed either locally or per-scale. These pooling operations are harder to define in both traditional scattering networks based on Morlet wavelets, and geometric scattering networks based on Diffusion Wavelets. As a result, we are able to extract a rich set of descriptive yet robust features that can be used along with very simple machine learning methods (i.e., logistic regression or support vector machines) to achieve high-accuracy classification systems with far fewer parameters to train than most modern graph neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our MHSNs in three distinct types of problems: signal classification, domain (i.e., graph/simplex) classification, and molecular dynamics prediction. ",

    "abstract": "Human Pose Estimation (HPE) plays a crucial role in computer vision applications. However, it is difficult to deploy state-of-the-art models on resouce-limited devices due to the high computational costs of the networks. In this work, a binary human pose estimator named BiHRNet(Binary HRNet) is proposed, whose weights and activations are expressed as $\\pm$1. BiHRNet retains the keypoint extraction ability of HRNet, while using fewer computing resources by adapting binary neural network (BNN). In order to reduce the accuracy drop caused by network binarization, two categories of techniques are proposed in this work. For optimizing the training process for binary pose estimator, we propose a new loss function combining KL divergence loss with AWing loss, which makes the binary network obtain more comprehensive output distribution from its real-valued counterpart to reduce information loss caused by binarization. For designing more binarization-friendly structures, we propose a new information reconstruction bottleneck called IR Bottleneck to retain more information in the initial stage of the network. In addition, we also propose a multi-scale basic block called MS-Block for information retention. Our work has less computation cost with few precision drop. Experimental results demonstrate that BiHRNet achieves a PCKh of 87.9 on the MPII dataset, which outperforms all binary pose estimation networks. On the challenging of COCO dataset, the proposed method enables the binary neural network to achieve 70.8 mAP, which is better than most tested lightweight full-precision networks. ",

    "abstract": "Data collected by different modalities can provide a wealth of complementary information, such as hyperspectral image (HSI) to offer rich spectral-spatial properties, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to provide structural information about the Earth's surface, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) to cover altitude information about ground elevation. Therefore, a natural idea is to combine multimodal images for refined and accurate land-cover interpretation. Although many efforts have been attempted to achieve multi-source remote sensing image classification, there are still three issues as follows: 1) indiscriminate feature representation without sufficiently considering modal heterogeneity, 2) abundant features and complex computations associated with modeling long-range dependencies, and 3) overfitting phenomenon caused by sparsely labeled samples. To overcome the above barriers, a transformer-based heterogeneously salient graph representation (THSGR) approach is proposed in this paper. First, a multimodal heterogeneous graph encoder is presented to encode distinctively non-Euclidean structural features from heterogeneous data. Then, a self-attention-free multi-convolutional modulator is designed for effective and efficient long-term dependency modeling. Finally, a mean forward is put forward in order to avoid overfitting. Based on the above structures, the proposed model is able to break through modal gaps to obtain differentiated graph representation with competitive time cost, even for a small fraction of training samples. Experiments and analyses on three benchmark datasets with various state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods show the performance of the proposed approach. ",

    "abstract": "Timestamped relational datasets consisting of records between pairs of entities are ubiquitous in data and network science. For applications like peer-to-peer communication, email, social network interactions, and computer network security, it makes sense to organize these records into groups based on how and when they are occurring. Weighted line graphs offer a natural way to model how records are related in such datasets but for large real-world graph topologies the complexity of building and utilizing the line graph is prohibitive. We present an algorithm to cluster the edges of a dynamic graph via the associated line graph without forming it explicitly. We outline a novel hierarchical dynamic graph edge clustering approach that efficiently breaks massive relational datasets into small sets of edges containing events at various timescales. This is in stark contrast to traditional graph clustering algorithms that prioritize highly connected community structures. Our approach relies on constructing a sufficient subgraph of a weighted line graph and applying a hierarchical agglomerative clustering. This work draws particular inspiration from HDBSCAN. We present a parallel algorithm and show that it is able to break billion-scale dynamic graphs into small sets that correlate in topology and time. The entire clustering process for a graph with $O(10 \\text{ billion})$ edges takes just a few minutes of run time on 256 nodes of a distributed compute environment. We argue how the output of the edge clustering is useful for a multitude of data visualization and powerful machine learning tasks, both involving the original massive dynamic graph data and/or the non-relational metadata. Finally, we demonstrate its use on a real-world large-scale directed dynamic graph and describe how it can be extended to dynamic hypergraphs and graphs with unstructured data living on vertices and edges.

A significant challenge in online teaching is the absence of real-time feedback from teachers on students learning progress. This paper introduces a novel approach employing deep learning techniques based on facial expressions to assess students engagement levels during online learning sessions. Human emotions cannot be adequately conveyed by a student using only the basic emotions, including anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and neutrality. To address this challenge, proposed a generation of four complex emotions such as confusion, satisfaction, disappointment, and frustration by combining the basic emotions. These complex emotions are often experienced simultaneously by students during the learning session. To depict these emotions dynamically,utilized a continuous stream of image frames instead of discrete images. The proposed work utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to categorize the fundamental emotional states of learners accurately. The proposed CNN model demonstrates strong performance, achieving a 95% accuracy in precise categorization of learner emotions. ",

However, there is a challenge that image models are limited in their ability to analyze the temporal aspects of videos, which is crucial for a successful video attack. To address this challenge, we introduce the Breaking Temporal Consistency (BTC) method, which is the first attempt to incorporate temporal information into video attacks using image models. We aim to generate adversarial videos that have opposite patterns to the original. Specifically, BTC-UAP minimizes the feature similarity between neighboring frames in videos. Our approach is simple but effective at attacking unseen video models. Additionally, it is applicable to videos of varying lengths and invariant to temporal shifts.

It has gained substantial attention in various domains of information security, including network intrusion, financial fraud, and malicious comments, et al. Existing methods are primarily developed in an unsupervised manner due to the challenge in obtaining labeled data. For lack of guidance from prior knowledge in unsupervised manner, the identified anomalies may prove to be data noise or individual data instances. In real-world scenarios, a limited batch of labeled anomalies can be captured, making it crucial to investigate the few-shot problem in graph anomaly detection. Taking advantage of this potential, we propose a novel few-shot Graph Anomaly Detection model called FMGAD (Few-shot Message-Enhanced Contrastive-based Graph Anomaly Detector). FMGAD leverages a self-supervised contrastive learning strategy within and across views to capture intrinsic and transferable structural representations. Furthermore, we propose the Deep-GNN message-enhanced reconstruction module, which extensively exploits the few-shot label information and enables long-range propagation to disseminate supervision signals to deeper unlabeled nodes. This module in turn assists in the training of self-supervised contrastive learning. Comprehensive experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that FMGAD can achieve better performance than other state-of-the-art methods, regardless of artificially injected anomalies or domain-organic anomalies.

Although using multiple annotations for each image in the fully-supervised has been extensively studied for training deep models, obtaining a large amount of multi-annotated data is challenging due to the substantial time and manpower costs required for segmentation annotations, resulting in most images lacking any annotations. To address this, we propose Multi-annotated Semi-supervised Ensemble Networks (MSE-Nets) for learning segmentation from limited multi-annotated and abundant unannotated data. Specifically, we introduce the Network Pairwise Consistency Enhancement (NPCE) module and Multi-Network Pseudo Supervised (MNPS) module to enhance MSE-Nets for the segmentation task by considering two major factors: (1) to optimize the utilization of all accessible multi-annotated data, the NPCE separates (dis)agreement annotations of multi-annotated data at the pixel level and handles agreement and disagreement annotations in different ways, (2) to mitigate the introduction of imprecise pseudo-labels, the MNPS extends the training data by leveraging consistent pseudo-labels from unannotated data. Finally, we improve confidence calibration by averaging the predictions of base networks. Experiments on the ISIC dataset show that we reduced the demand for multi-annotated data by 97.75\\% and narrowed the gap with the best fully-supervised baseline to just a Jaccard index of 4\\%. Furthermore, compared to other semi-supervised methods that rely only on a single annotation or a combined fusion approach, the comprehensive experimental results on ISIC and RIGA datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in medical image segmentation with ambiguous boundaries.

    "abstract": "Fingerprint traits are widely recognized for their unique qualities and security benefits. Despite their extensive use, fingerprint features can be vulnerable to puppet attacks, where attackers manipulate a reluctant but genuine user into completing the authentication process. Defending against such attacks is challenging due to the coexistence of a legitimate identity and an illegitimate intent. In this paper, we propose PUPGUARD, a solution designed to guard against puppet attacks. This method is based on user behavioral patterns, specifically, the user needs to press the capture device twice successively with different fingers during the authentication process. PUPGUARD leverages both the image features of fingerprints and the timing characteristics of the pressing intervals to establish two-factor authentication. More specifically, after extracting image features and timing characteristics, and performing feature selection on the image features, PUPGUARD fuses these two features into a one-dimensional feature vector, and feeds it into a one-class classifier to obtain the classification result. This two-factor authentication method emphasizes dynamic behavioral patterns during the authentication process, thereby enhancing security against puppet attacks. To assess PUPGUARD's effectiveness, we conducted experiments on datasets collected from 31 subjects, including image features and timing characteristics. Our experimental results demonstrate that PUPGUARD achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 97.87% and a remarkably low false positive rate (FPR) of 1.89%. Furthermore, we conducted comparative experiments to validate the superiority of combining image features and timing characteristics within PUPGUARD for enhancing resistance against puppet attacks.

We further investigate the effects of updating the model by retraining it on all the available data (full-history approach) and on only the newest data (sliding window approach).

The field of natural language processing (NLP) has recently experienced a surge in the development of powerful language models. These models have proven to be invaluable tools for studying another complex system known to process human language: the brain. Previous studies have demonstrated that the features of language models can be mapped to fMRI brain activity. This raises the question: is there a commonality between information processing in language models and the human brain? To estimate information flow patterns in a language model, we examined the causal relationships between different layers. Drawing inspiration from the workspace framework for consciousness, we hypothesized that features integrating more information would more accurately predict higher hierarchical brain activity. To validate this hypothesis, we classified language model features into two categories based on causal network measures: 'low in-degree' and 'high in-degree'. We subsequently compared the brain prediction accuracy maps for these two groups. Our results reveal that the difference in prediction accuracy follows a hierarchical pattern, consistent with the cortical hierarchy map revealed by activity time constants. This finding suggests a parallel between how language models and the human brain process linguistic information. ",

Then when it comes to the aforementioned multi-lingual tasks, it is challenging to utilize these monolingual embeddings given that even if the embedding spaces have a similar geometric arrangement due to an identical training process, the embeddings of the languages considered are not aligned. This is solved by the embedding alignment task. Even in this, high-resource language pairs are in the limelight while low-resource languages such as Sinhala which is in dire need of help seem to have fallen by the wayside. In this paper, we try to align Sinhala and English word embedding spaces based on available alignment techniques and introduce a benchmark for Sinhala language embedding alignment. In addition to that, to facilitate the supervised alignment, as an intermediate task, we also introduce Sinhala-English alignment datasets. These datasets serve as our anchor datasets for supervised word embedding alignment. Even though we do not obtain results comparable to the high-resource languages such as French, German, or Chinese, we believe our work lays the groundwork for more specialized alignment between English and Sinhala embeddings.

    "abstract": "Though feature-alignment based Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) have achieved remarkable progress, they ignore the source bias issue, i.e. the aligned features are more favorable towards the source domain, leading to a sub-optimal adaptation. Furthermore, the presence of domain shift between the source and target domains exacerbates the problem of inconsistent classification and localization in general detection pipelines. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Distillation-based Unbiased Alignment (DUA) framework for DAOD, which can distill the source features towards a more balanced position via a pre-trained teacher model during the training process, alleviating the problem of source bias effectively. In addition, we design a Target-Relevant Object Localization Network (TROLN), which can mine target-related knowledge to produce two classification-free metrics (IoU and centerness). Accordingly, we implement a Domain-aware Consistency Enhancing (DCE) strategy that utilizes these two metrics to further refine classification confidences, achieving a harmonization between classification and localization in cross-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to manifest the effectiveness of this method, which consistently improves the strong baseline by large margins, outperforming existing alignment-based works.

Utilizing neural networks as CBFs has shown great success, but it necessitates their certification as CBFs. In this work, we leverage bound propagation techniques and the Branch-and-Bound scheme to efficiently verify that a neural network satisfies the conditions to be a CBF over the continuous state space. To accelerate training, we further present a framework that embeds the verification scheme into the training loop to synthesize and verify a neural CBF simultaneously. In particular, we employ the verification scheme to identify partitions of the state space that are not guaranteed to satisfy the CBF conditions and expand the training dataset by incorporating additional data from these partitions. The neural network is then optimized using the augmented dataset to meet the CBF conditions. We show that for a non-linear control-affine system, our framework can efficiently certify a neural network as a CBF and render a larger safe set than state-of-the-art neural CBF works. We further employ our learned neural CBF to derive a safe controller to illustrate the practical use of our framework. ",

We introduce a definition of layering that captures dependencies between the proof steps (nodes). Nodes in each layer can then be verified in parallel as long as prior layers have been verified. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms on proof graphs, we propose a framework for finding the performance bounds and patterns using directed acyclic network topologies (DANTs). This framework allows us to create concrete instances of DANTs for empirical evaluation of our algorithms. With this, we compare our set of parallel algorithms against a serial implementation with two experiments: one scaling both the problem size and the other scaling the number of threads. Our findings show that parallelization results in improved verification performance for certain DANT instances.

Machine unlearning seeks to retroactively remove such details from model weights to protect privacy. We contribute a lightweight unlearning algorithm that leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) for selective forgetting. Prior work in this area requires full retraining or large matrix inversions, which are computationally expensive. Our key insight is that the diagonal elements of the FIM, which measure the sensitivity of log-likelihood to changes in weights, contain sufficient information for effective forgetting. Specifically, we compute the FIM diagonal over two subsets -- the data to retain and forget -- for all trainable weights. This diagonal representation approximates the complete FIM while dramatically reducing computation. We then use it to selectively update weights to maximize forgetting of the sensitive subset while minimizing impact on the retained subset. Experiments show that our algorithm can successfully forget any randomly selected subsets of training data across neural network architectures. By leveraging the FIM diagonal, our approach provides an interpretable, lightweight, and efficient solution for machine unlearning with practical privacy benefits. ",

Traditional sequential recommendation models usually utilize ID embeddings to represent items, which are not shared across different domains and lack the transferable ability. Recent studies use pre-trained language models (PLM) for item text embeddings (text-based IRL) that are universally applicable across domains. However, the existing text-based IRL is unaware of the important collaborative filtering (CF) information. In this paper, we propose CoWPiRec, an approach of Collaborative Word-based Pre-trained item representation for Recommendation. To effectively incorporate CF information into text-based IRL, we convert the item-level interaction data to a word graph containing word-level collaborations. Subsequently, we design a novel pre-training task to align the word-level semantic- and CF-related item representation. Extensive experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art transferable sequential recommenders, CoWPiRec achieves significantly better performances in both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings for cross-scenario recommendation and effectively alleviates the cold-start issue.

Recently, general linear lower and upper bounds from fitness levels have been constructed. However, the construction of these bounds requires recursive computation, which makes them difficult to use in practice. We address this shortcoming with a new directed graph (digraph) method that does not require recursive computation and significantly simplifies the calculation of coefficients in linear bounds. In this method, an EA is modeled as a Markov chain on a digraph. Lower and upper bounds are directly calculated using conditional transition probabilities on the digraph. This digraph method provides straightforward and explicit expressions of lower and upper time bound for elitist EAs. In particular, it can be used to derive tight lower bound on both fitness landscapes without and with shortcuts. This is demonstrated through four examples: the (1+1) EA on OneMax, FullyDeceptive, TwoMax1 and Deceptive. Our work extends the fitness level method from addressing simple fitness functions without shortcuts to more realistic functions with shortcuts. ",

Our approach aims at mitigating bias by considering the causal relationships among variables and incorporating them into the reweighting process. The proposed method adopts two neural networks, whose structures are intentionally used to reflect the structures of a causal graph and of an interventional graph. The two neural networks can approximate the causal model of the data, and the causal model of interventions. Furthermore, reweighting guided by a discriminator is applied to achieve various fairness notions. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method can achieve causal fairness on the data while remaining close to the original data for downstream tasks. ",

This is especially true in the areas of min-max regret robust optimization, network interdiction, most vital vertex problems, blocker problems, and two-stage adjustable robust optimization problems. Even though these areas are well-researched for over two decades and one would naturally expect many (if not most) of the problems occurring in these areas to be complete for the above classes, almost no completeness results exist in the literature. We address this lack of knowledge by introducing over 70 new $\\Sigma^p_2$-complete and $\\Sigma^p_3$-complete problems. We achieve this result by proving a new meta-theorem, which shows $\\Sigma^p_2$- and $\\Sigma^p_3$-completeness simultaneously for a huge class of problems. The majority of all earlier publications on $\\Sigma^p_2$- and $\\Sigma^p_3$-completeness in said areas are special cases of our meta-theorem. Our precise result is the following: We introduce a large list of problems for which the meta-theorem is applicable (including clique, vertex cover, knapsack, TSP, facility location and many more). For every problem on this list, we show: The interdiction/minimum cost blocker/most vital nodes problem (with element costs) is $\\Sigma^p_2$-complete. The min-max-regret problem with interval uncertainty is $\\Sigma^p_2$-complete. The two-stage adjustable robust optimization problem with discrete budgeted uncertainty is $\\Sigma^p_3$-complete. In summary, our work reveals the interesting insight that a large amount of NP-complete problems have the property that their min-max versions are 'automatically' $\\Sigma^p_2$-complete. ",

However, from a computational linguistic perspective, it is considered a low-resource language, with limited resources to support Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Online platforms often facilitate social interactions that can lead to the use of offensive and threatening language, which can go undetected due to the lack of detection systems designed for Hausa. This study aimed to address this issue by (1) conducting two user studies (n=308) to investigate cyberbullying-related issues, (2) collecting and annotating the first set of offensive and threatening datasets to support relevant downstream tasks in Hausa, (3) developing a detection system to flag offensive and threatening content, and (4) evaluating the detection system and the efficacy of the Google-based translation engine in detecting offensive and threatening terms in Hausa. We found that offensive and threatening content is quite common, particularly when discussing religion and politics. Our detection system was able to detect more than 70% of offensive and threatening content, although many of these were mistranslated by Google's translation engine. We attribute this to the subtle relationship between offensive and threatening content and idiomatic expressions in the Hausa language. We recommend that diverse stakeholders participate in understanding local conventions and demographics in order to develop a more effective detection system.

However, DNN inference is computationally intensive, which can be prohibitive e.g. when considering edge devices. To solve this problem, a popular solution is DNN pruning, and more so structured pruning, where coherent computational blocks (e.g. channels for convolutional networks) are removed: as an exhaustive search of the space of pruned sub-models is intractable in practice, channels are typically removed iteratively based on an importance estimation heuristic. Recently, promising latency-aware pruning methods were proposed, where channels are removed until the network reaches a target budget of wall-clock latency pre-emptively estimated on specific hardware. In this paper, we present Archtree, a novel method for latency-driven structured pruning of DNNs. Archtree explores multiple candidate pruned sub-models in parallel in a tree-like fashion, allowing for a better exploration of the search space. Furthermore, it involves on-the-fly latency estimation on the target hardware, accounting for closer latencies as compared to the specified budget. Empirical results on several DNN architectures and target hardware show that Archtree better preserves the original model accuracy while better fitting the latency budget as compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Most of the research on RIS has been dedicated to system-level optimization and, with the advent of beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), to RIS architecture design.

In this study, we propose a universal framework for the multiport network analysis of RIS-aided systems. With our framework, we model RIS-aided systems and RIS architectures through impedance, admittance, and scattering parameter analysis. Based on these analyses, three equivalent models are derived accounting for the effects of impedance mismatching and mutual coupling. The three models are then simplified by assuming large transmission distances, perfect matching, and no mutual coupling to understand the role of the RIS in the communication model. The derived simplified models are consistent with the model used in related literature, although we show that an additional approximation is commonly considered in the literature. We discuss the benefits of each analysis in characterizing and optimizing the RIS and how to select the most suitable parameters according to the needs. Numerical results provide additional evidence of the equivalence of the three analyses. ",

For many years, mathematical simulation tools have been the most common approach to reconstructing an estimate of the WDN hydraulics. However, pure physics-based simulations involve several challenges, e.g. partially observable data, high uncertainty, and extensive manual configuration. Thus, data-driven approaches have gained traction to overcome such limitations. In this work, we combine physics-based modeling and Graph Neural Networks (GNN), a data-driven approach, to address the pressure estimation problem. First, we propose a new data generation method using a mathematical simulation but not considering temporal patterns and including some control parameters that remain untouched in previous works; this contributes to a more diverse training data. Second, our training strategy relies on random sensor placement making our GNN-based estimation model robust to unexpected sensor location changes. Third, a realistic evaluation protocol considers real temporal patterns and additionally injects the uncertainties intrinsic to real-world scenarios. Finally, a multi-graph pre-training strategy allows the model to be reused for pressure estimation in unseen target WDNs. Our GNN-based model estimates the pressure of a large-scale WDN in The Netherlands with a MAE of 1.94mH$_2$O and a MAPE of 7%, surpassing the performance of previous studies. Likewise, it outperformed previous approaches on other WDN benchmarks, showing a reduction of absolute error up to approximately 52% in the best cases. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for performing computations using Look-Up Tables (LUTs) tailored specifically for Compute-in-Memory applications. The aim is to address the scalability challenges associated with LUT-based computation by reducing storage requirements and energy consumption while capitalizing on the faster and more energy-efficient nature of look-up methods compared to conventional mathematical computations. The proposed method leverages a divide and conquer (D&C) strategy to enhance the scalability of LUT-based computation. By breaking down high-precision multiplications into lower-precision operations, the technique achieves significantly lower area overheads, up to approximately 3.7 times less than conventional LUT-based approaches, without compromising accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive simulations using TSMC 65 nm technology were conducted. The experimental analysis reveals that the proposed approach accounts for less than 0.1\\% of the total energy consumption, with only a 32\\% increase in area overhead. These results demonstrate considerable improvements achieved in energy efficiency and area utilization through the novel low-energy, low-area-overhead LUT-based computation in an SRAM array. ",

In this paper, a novel trajectory prediction model, Social Force Generative Adversarial Network (SoFGAN), is proposed. SoFGAN uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and Social Force Model (SFM) to generate different plausible people trajectories reducing collisions in a scene. Furthermore, a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) module is added to emphasize the destination learning. We show that our method is more accurate in making predictions in UCY or BIWI datasets than most of the current state-of-the-art models and also reduces collisions in comparison to other approaches. Through real-life experiments, we demonstrate that the model can be used in real-time without GPU's to perform good quality predictions with a low computational cost. ",

Chatbots, for example, are increasingly used as social companions, but little is known about how their use impacts human relationships. A common hypothesis is that these companion bots are detrimental to social health by harming or replacing human interaction. To understand how companion bots impact social health, we studied people who used companion bots and people who did not. Contrary to expectations, companion bot users indicated that these relationships were beneficial to their social health, whereas nonusers viewed them as harmful. Another common assumption is that people perceive conscious, humanlike AI as disturbing and threatening. Among both users and nonusers, however, we found the opposite: perceiving companion bots as more conscious and humanlike correlated with more positive opinions and better social health benefits. Humanlike bots may aid social health by supplying reliable and safe interactions, without necessarily harming human relationships. ",

Recently, Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) such as TabPFN have successfully learned to classify tabular data in-context: the model parameters are designed to classify new samples based on labelled training samples given after the model training. While such models show great promise, their applicability to real-world data remains limited due to the computational scale needed. Here we study the following question: given a pre-trained PFN for tabular data, what is the best way to summarize the labelled training samples before feeding them to the model? We conduct an initial investigation of sketching and feature-selection methods for TabPFN, and note certain key differences between it and conventionally fitted tabular models. ",

Subsampling the graph is a viable alternative, but sampling on graphs is nontrivial as graphs are non-Euclidean. Existing graph sampling techniques require not only computing the spectra of large matrices but also repeating these computations when the graph changes, e.g., grows. In this paper, we introduce a signal sampling theory for a type of graph limit -- the graphon. We prove a Poincar\\'e inequality for graphon signals and show that complements of node subsets satisfying this inequality are unique sampling sets for Paley-Wiener spaces of graphon signals. Exploiting connections with spectral clustering and Gaussian elimination, we prove that such sampling sets are consistent in the sense that unique sampling sets on a convergent graph sequence converge to unique sampling sets on the graphon. We then propose a related graphon signal sampling algorithm for large graphs, and demonstrate its good empirical performance on graph machine learning tasks. ",

This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance LLMs by effectively extracting the relevant knowledge from domain-specific textual sources, and the adaptive training of a chatbot with domain-specific inquiries. Our two-step approach starts from training a knowledge miner, namely LLMiner, which autonomously extracts Question-Answer pairs from relevant documents through a chain-of-thought reasoning process. Subsequently, we blend the mined QA pairs with a conversational dataset to fine-tune the LLM as a chatbot, thereby enriching its domain-specific expertise and conversational capabilities. We also developed a new evaluation benchmark which comprises four domain-specific text corpora and associated human-crafted QA pairs for testing. Our model shows remarkable performance improvement over generally aligned LLM and surpasses domain-adapted models directly fine-tuned on domain corpus. In particular, LLMiner achieves this with minimal human intervention, requiring only 600 seed instances, thereby providing a pathway towards self-improvement of LLMs through model-synthesized training data.

    "abstract": "In disentangled representation learning, the goal is to achieve a compact representation that consists of all interpretable generative factors in the observational data. Learning disentangled representations for graphs becomes increasingly important as graph data rapidly grows. Existing approaches often rely on Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) or its causal structure learning-based refinement, which suffer from sub-optimality in VAEs due to the independence factor assumption and unavailability of concept labels, respectively. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised solution, dubbed concept-free causal disentanglement, built on a theoretically provable tight upper bound approximating the optimal factor. This results in an SCM-like causal structure modeling that directly learns concept structures from data. Based on this idea, we propose Concept-free Causal VGAE (CCVGAE) by incorporating a novel causal disentanglement layer into Variational Graph Auto-Encoder. Furthermore, we prove concept consistency under our concept-free causal disentanglement framework, hence employing it to enhance the meta-learning framework, called concept-free causal Meta-Graph (CC-Meta-Graph). We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models: CCVGAE and CC-Meta-Graph, reaching up to $29\\%$ and $11\\%$ absolute improvements over baselines in terms of AUC, respectively.

This leader guides the system toward the target point while avoiding collisions with both fixed and moving obstacles. The gravitational and repulsion coefficient forces using various PSO methods are fine-tuned to achieve the best trajectory and minimize time duration.

However, such optimal embedding dimension is not known for other embeddings. Of particular interest are sparse OSEs, having $s\\ll m$ non-zeros per column, with applications to problems such as least squares regression and low-rank approximation.

We use this to construct the first oblivious subspace embedding with $O(d)$ embedding dimension that can be applied faster than current matrix multiplication time, and to obtain an optimal single-pass algorithm for least squares regression. We further extend our results to construct even sparser non-oblivious embeddings, leading to the first subspace embedding with low distortion $\\epsilon=o(1)$ and optimal embedding dimension $m=O(d/\\epsilon^2)$ that can be applied in current matrix multiplication time.

However, existing multimodal learning methods often struggle with challenges where some modalities appear more dominant than others during multimodal learning, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose MLA (Multimodal Learning with Alternating Unimodal Adaptation). MLA reframes the conventional joint multimodal learning process by transforming it into an alternating unimodal learning process, thereby minimizing interference between modalities. Simultaneously, it captures cross-modal interactions through a shared head, which undergoes continuous optimization across different modalities. This optimization process is controlled by a gradient modification mechanism to prevent the shared head from losing previously acquired information. During the inference phase, MLA utilizes a test-time uncertainty-based model fusion mechanism to integrate multimodal information. Extensive experiments are conducted on five diverse datasets, encompassing scenarios with complete modalities and scenarios with missing modalities. These experiments demonstrate the superiority of MLA over competing prior approaches. ",

Traditional methods like tumor grading scores (e.g., tumor regression grade - TRG) for prognosis suffer from subjectivity, time constraints, and expertise demands. Current machine learning approaches often focus on radiological data, yet the relevance of histological images for survival predictions, capturing intricate tumor microenvironment characteristics, is gaining recognition. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end approach for automated prognosis prediction using histology slides stained with H&E and HPS. We first employ a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for slide normalization to reduce staining variations and improve the overall quality of the images that are used as input to our prediction pipeline. We propose a semi-supervised model to perform tissue classification from sparse annotations, producing feature maps. We use an attention-based approach that weighs the importance of different slide regions in producing the final classification results. We exploit the extracted features for the metastatic nodules and surrounding tissue to train a prognosis model. In parallel, we train a vision Transformer (ViT) in a knowledge distillation framework to replicate and enhance the performance of the prognosis prediction. In our evaluation on a clinical dataset of 258 patients, our approach demonstrates superior performance with c-indexes of 0.804 (0.014) for OS and 0.733 (0.014) for TTR. Achieving 86.9% to 90.3% accuracy in predicting TRG dichotomization and 78.5% to 82.1% accuracy for the 3-class TRG classification task, our approach outperforms comparative methods.

To overcome that, we propose a graph learning framework that captures comprehensive features by integrating both correlation and distance-based similarity measures under a contrastive loss. This approach results in a more expressive framework that captures brain dynamic features at different scales and enables more accurate prediction of treatment response.
