    "abstract": "Detecting anomalies in a daily time series with a weekly pattern is a common task with a wide range of applications. A typical way of performing the task is by using decomposition method. However, the method often generates false positive results where a data point falls within its weekly range but is just off from its weekday position. We refer to this type of anomalies as \"in-season anomalies\", and propose a k-parameter approach to address the issue. The approach provides configurable extra tolerance for in-season anomalies to suppress misleading alerts while preserving real positives. It yields favorable result. ",

    "abstract": "Over the last decades, many prognostic models based on artificial intelligence techniques have been used to provide detailed predictions in healthcare. Unfortunately, the real-world observational data used to train and validate these models are almost always affected by biases that can strongly impact the outcomes validity: two examples are values missing not-at-random and selection bias. Addressing them is a key element in achieving transportability and in studying the causal relationships that are critical in clinical decision making, going beyond simpler statistical approaches based on probabilistic association. In this context, we propose a novel approach that combines selection diagrams, missingness graphs, causal discovery and prior knowledge into a single graphical model to estimate the cardiovascular risk of adolescent and young females who survived breast cancer. We learn this model from data comprising two different cohorts of patients. The resulting causal network model is validated by expert clinicians in terms of risk assessment, accuracy and explainability, and provides a prognostic model that outperforms competing machine learning methods.

Through uplift modeling, we can identify the treatment with the greatest benefit. On the other side, we can identify clients who are likely to make favorable decisions in response to a certain treatment. In the past, uplift modeling approaches relied heavily on the difference-in-difference (DID) architecture, paired with a machine learning model as the estimation learner, while neglecting the link and confidential information between features. We proposed a framework based on graph neural networks that combine causal knowledge with an estimate of uplift value. Firstly, we presented a causal representation technique based on CATE (conditional average treatment effect) estimation and adjacency matrix structure learning. Secondly, we suggested a more scalable uplift modeling framework based on graph convolution networks for combining causal knowledge. Our findings demonstrate that this method works effectively for predicting uplift values, with small errors in typical simulated data, and its effectiveness has been verified in actual industry marketing data.

The proposed method provides rigorous guarantees of safety in the presence of bounded perturbations and implements DPC so long as the DPC control satisfies the system constraints. The approach also incorporates two forms of event-triggering to reduce online computation. The approach is comprised of a robust predictive safety filter that extends upon existing work to reject disturbances for discrete-time, time-varying nonlinear systems with time-varying constraints. The safety filter is based on novel concepts of robust, discrete-time barrier functions and can be used to filter any control law. Here we use the safety filter in conjunction with DPC as a promising policy optimization method. The approach is demonstrated on a single-integrator, two-tank system, and building example. ",

    "abstract": "Domain Generalization (DG) techniques have emerged as a popular approach to address the challenges of domain shift in Deep Learning (DL), with the goal of generalizing well to the target domain unseen during the training. In recent years, numerous methods have been proposed to address the DG setting, among which one popular approach is the adversarial learning-based methodology. The main idea behind adversarial DG methods is to learn domain-invariant features by minimizing a discrepancy metric. However, most adversarial DG methods use 0-1 loss based $\\mathcal{H}\\Delta\\mathcal{H}$ divergence metric. In contrast, the margin loss-based discrepancy metric has the following advantages: more informative, tighter, practical, and efficiently optimizable. To mitigate this gap, this work proposes a novel adversarial learning DG algorithm, MADG, motivated by a margin loss-based discrepancy metric. The proposed MADG model learns domain-invariant features across all source domains and uses adversarial training to generalize well to the unseen target domain. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed MADG model based on the unseen target error bound. Specifically, we construct the link between the source and unseen domains in the real-valued hypothesis space and derive the generalization bound using margin loss and Rademacher complexity. We extensively experiment with the MADG model on popular real-world DG datasets, VLCS, PACS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraIncognita. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on DomainBed's benchmark and observe consistent performance across all the datasets. ",

Here we present artificial mental rotation (AMR), a novel deep learning paradigm for dealing with in-plane rotations inspired by the neuro-psychological concept of mental rotation. Our simple AMR implementation works with all common CNN and ViT architectures. We test it on ImageNet, Stanford Cars, and Oxford Pet.

Recent advances made these attacks possible even in air-gapped scenarios, where the autonomous system observes its surroundings by, e.g., a camera. We extend these ideas in our research and evaluate the robustness of multi-camera setups against such physical adversarial examples. This scenario becomes ever more important with the rise in popularity of autonomous vehicles, which fuse the information of several cameras for their driving decision. While we find that multi-camera setups provide some robustness towards past attack methods, we see that this advantage reduces when optimizing on multiple perspectives at once. We propose a novel attack method that we call Transcender-MC, where we incorporate online 3D renderings and perspective projections in the training process. Moreover, we motivate that certain data augmentation techniques can facilitate the generation of successful adversarial examples even further. Transcender-MC is 11% more effective in successfully attacking multi-camera setups than state-of-the-art methods. Our findings offer valuable insights regarding the resilience of object detection in a setup with multiple cameras and motivate the need of developing adequate defense mechanisms against them. ",

    "abstract": "Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns an optimal policy, given some expert demonstrations, thus avoiding the need for the tedious process of specifying a suitable reward function. However, current methods are constrained by at least one of the following requirements. The first one is the need to fully solve a forward Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem in the inner loop of the algorithm, which might be prohibitively expensive in many complex environments. The second one is the need for full trajectories from the experts, which might not be easily available. The third one is the assumption that the expert data is homogeneous rather than a collection from various experts or possibly alternative solutions to the same task. Such constraints make IRL approaches either not scalable or not usable on certain existing systems. In this work we propose an approach which removes these requirements through a dynamic, adaptive method called Adversarial Imitation Learning on Aggregated Data (AILAD). It learns conjointly both a non linear reward function and the associated optimal policy using an adversarial framework. The reward learner only uses aggregated data. Moreover, it generates diverse behaviors producing a distribution over the aggregated data matching that of the experts. ",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on coding related tasks, particularly on assisting humans in programming and facilitating programming automation. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating the code understanding and generation capacities of LLMs suffer from severe limitations. First, most benchmarks are deficient as they focus on a narrow range of popular programming languages and specific tasks, whereas the real-world software development scenarios show dire need to implement systems with multilingual programming environments to satisfy diverse requirements. Practical programming practices also strongly expect multi-task settings for testing coding capabilities of LLMs comprehensively and robustly. Second, most benchmarks also fail to consider the actual executability and the consistency of execution results of the generated code. To bridge these gaps between existing benchmarks and expectations from practical applications, we introduce CodeScope, an execution-based, multilingual, multi-task, multi-dimensional evaluation benchmark for comprehensively gauging LLM capabilities on coding tasks. CodeScope covers 43 programming languages and 8 coding tasks. It evaluates the coding performance of LLMs from three dimensions (perspectives): difficulty, efficiency, and length. To facilitate execution-based evaluations of code generation, we develop MultiCodeEngine, an automated code execution engine that supports 14 programming languages. Finally, we systematically evaluate and analyze 8 mainstream LLMs on CodeScope tasks and demonstrate the superior breadth and challenges of CodeScope for evaluating LLMs on code understanding and generation tasks compared to other benchmarks.

Although recent attack methods can achieve a relatively high attack success rate (ASR), our observation shows that the generated adversarial examples have a different data distribution compared with the original examples. Specifically, these adversarial examples exhibit lower confidence levels and higher distance to the training data distribution. As a result, they are easy to detect using very simple detection methods, diminishing the actual effectiveness of these attack methods. To solve this problem, we propose a Distribution-Aware LoRA-based Adversarial Attack (DALA) method, which considers the distribution shift of adversarial examples to improve attack effectiveness under detection methods. We further design a new evaluation metric NASR combining ASR and detection for the attack task. We conduct experiments on four widely-used datasets and validate the attack effectiveness on ASR and NASR of the adversarial examples generated by DALA on the BERT-base model and the black-box LLaMA2-7b model.

    "abstract": "As NIST is putting the final touches on the standardization of PQC (Post Quantum Cryptography) public key algorithms, it is a racing certainty that peskier cryptographic attacks undeterred by those new PQC algorithms will surface. Such a trend in turn will prompt more follow-up studies of attacks and countermeasures. As things stand, from the attackers' perspective, one viable form of attack that can be implemented thereupon is the so-called \"side-channel attack\". Two best-known countermeasures heralded to be durable against side-channel attacks are: \"masking\" and \"hiding\". In that dichotomous picture, of particular note are successful single-trace attacks on some of the NIST's PQC then-candidates, which worked to the detriment of the former: \"masking\". In this paper, we cast an eye over the latter: \"hiding\". Hiding proves to be durable against both side-channel attacks and another equally robust type of attacks called \"fault injection attacks\", and hence is deemed an auspicious countermeasure to be implemented. Mathematically, the hiding method is fundamentally based on random permutations. There has been a cornucopia of studies on generating random permutations. However, those are not tied to implementation of the hiding method. In this paper, we propose a reliable and efficient verification of permutation implementation, through employing Fisher-Yates' shuffling method. We introduce the concept of an n-th order permutation and explain how it can be used to verify that our implementation is more efficient than its previous-gen counterparts for hiding countermeasures.

Many existing works about traffic prediction integrate various temporal encoders and graph convolution networks (GCNs), called spatio-temporal graph-based neural networks, which focus on predicting dense variables such as flow, speed and demand in time snapshots, but they can hardly forecast the traffic congestion events that are sparsely distributed on the continuous time axis. In recent years, neural point process (NPP) has emerged as an appropriate framework for event prediction in continuous time scenarios. However, most conventional works about NPP cannot model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies and congestion evolution patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a spatio-temporal graph neural point process framework, named STGNPP for traffic congestion event prediction. Specifically, we first design the spatio-temporal graph learning module to fully capture the long-range spatio-temporal dependencies from the historical traffic state data along with the road network. The extracted spatio-temporal hidden representation and congestion event information are then fed into a continuous gated recurrent unit to model the congestion evolution patterns. In particular, to fully exploit the periodic information, we also improve the intensity function calculation of the point process with a periodic gated mechanism. Finally, our model simultaneously predicts the occurrence time and duration of the next congestion. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches. ",

This simple strategy is surprisingly effective, with results largely comparable to those of the original neural model, as shown across three large pre-trained language models, two datasets of varying scale, four classic models, and four evaluation metrics.

In this work, we employ adversarial learning to bridge the domain gap between foreground feature map and background feature map. Specifically, we design a dual-encoder generator, in which the residual encoder produces the residual features added to the foreground feature map from main encoder. Then, a pixel-wise discriminator plays against the generator, encouraging the refined foreground feature map to be indistinguishable from background feature map. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method could achieve more harmonious and visually appealing results than previous methods. ",

In this study, we propose a framework to study the effect of input perturbations on language models of different scales, from pre-trained models to large language models (LLMs). We use fine-tuning to train a robust model to perturbations, and we investigate whether exposure to one perturbation improves or degrades the model's performance on other perturbations. To address multi-perturbation robustness, we suggest three distinct training strategies. We also extend the framework to LLMs via a chain of thought(COT) prompting with exemplars. We instantiate our framework for the Tabular-NLI task and show that the proposed strategies train the model robust to different perturbations without losing accuracy on a given dataset. ",

This work studies online player interactions during the turn-based strategy game, Diplomacy. We annotated a dataset of over 10,000 chat messages for different negotiation strategies and empirically examined their importance in predicting long- and short-term game outcomes. Although negotiation strategies can be predicted reasonably accurately through the linguistic modeling of the chat messages, more is needed for predicting short-term outcomes such as trustworthiness. On the other hand, they are essential in graph-aware reinforcement learning approaches to predict long-term outcomes, such as a player's success, based on their prior negotiation history.

It's noted that not only the head pose but also eye blinking are both important aspects for deep fake detection. The implicit control of poses by video has already achieved by the state-of-art work. According to recent research, eye blinking has weak correlation with input audio which means eye blinks extraction from audio and generation are possible. Hence, we propose a GAN-based architecture to extract eye blink feature from input audio and reference video respectively and employ contrastive training between them, then embed it into the concatenated features of identity and poses to generate talking face images. Experimental results show that the proposed method can generate photo-realistic talking face with synchronous lips motions, natural head poses and blinking eyes. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in deep learning-based approaches have led to remarkable progress in fruit detection, enabling robust fruit identification in complex environments. However, much less progress has been made on fruit 3D localization, which is equally crucial for robotic harvesting. Complex fruit shape/orientation, fruit clustering, varying lighting conditions, and occlusions by leaves and branches have greatly restricted existing sensors from achieving accurate fruit localization in the natural orchard environment. In this paper, we report on the design of a novel localization technique, called Active Laser-Camera Scanning (ALACS), to achieve accurate and robust fruit 3D localization. The ALACS hardware setup comprises a red line laser, an RGB color camera, a linear motion slide, and an external RGB-D camera. Leveraging the principles of dynamic-targeting laser-triangulation, ALACS enables precise transformation of the projected 2D laser line from the surface of apples to the 3D positions. To facilitate laser pattern acquisitions, a Laser Line Extraction (LLE) method is proposed for robust and high-precision feature extraction on apples. Comprehensive evaluations of LLE demonstrated its ability to extract precise patterns under variable lighting and occlusion conditions. The ALACS system achieved average apple localization accuracies of 6.9 11.2 mm at distances ranging from 1.0 m to 1.6 m, compared to 21.5 mm by a commercial RealSense RGB-D camera, in an indoor experiment. Orchard evaluations demonstrated that ALACS has achieved a 95% fruit detachment rate versus a 71% rate by the RealSense camera. By overcoming the challenges of apple 3D localization, this research contributes to the advancement of robotic fruit harvesting technology. ",

    "abstract": "Precise estimation of Crash Modification Factors (CMFs) is central to evaluating the effectiveness of various road safety treatments and prioritizing infrastructure investment accordingly. While customized study for each countermeasure scenario is desired, the conventional CMF estimation approaches rely heavily on the availability of crash data at given sites. This not only makes the estimation costly, but the results are also less transferable, since the intrinsic similarities between different safety countermeasure scenarios are not fully explored. Aiming to fill this gap, this study introduces a novel knowledge-mining framework for CMF prediction. This framework delves into the connections of existing countermeasures and reduces the reliance of CMF estimation on crash data availability and manual data collection. Specifically, it draws inspiration from human comprehension processes and introduces advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract intricate variations and patterns from existing CMF knowledge. It effectively encodes unstructured countermeasure scenarios into machine-readable representations and models the complex relationships between scenarios and CMF values. This new data-driven framework provides a cost-effective and adaptable solution that complements the case-specific approaches for CMF estimation, which is particularly beneficial when availability of crash data or time imposes constraints. Experimental validation using real-world CMF Clearinghouse data demonstrates the effectiveness of this new approach, which shows significant accuracy improvements compared to baseline methods. This approach provides insights into new possibilities of harnessing accumulated transportation knowledge in various applications. ",

    "abstract": "Dialogue summarization task involves summarizing long conversations while preserving the most salient information. Real-life dialogues often involve naturally occurring variations (e.g., repetitions, hesitations) and existing dialogue summarization models suffer from performance drop on such conversations. In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of such variations on state-of-the-art dialogue summarization models using publicly available datasets. To simulate real-life variations, we introduce two types of perturbations: utterance-level perturbations that modify individual utterances with errors and language variations, and dialogue-level perturbations that add non-informative exchanges (e.g., repetitions, greetings). We conduct our analysis along three dimensions of robustness: consistency, saliency, and faithfulness, which capture different aspects of the summarization model's performance. We find that both fine-tuned and instruction-tuned models are affected by input variations, with the latter being more susceptible, particularly to dialogue-level perturbations. We also validate our findings via human evaluation. Finally, we investigate if the robustness of fine-tuned models can be improved by training them with a fraction of perturbed data and observe that this approach is insufficient to address robustness challenges with current models and thus warrants a more thorough investigation to identify better solutions. Overall, our work highlights robustness challenges in dialogue summarization and provides insights for future research. ",

To prevent the malicious usage of LLMs, detecting LLM-generated text becomes crucial in the deployment of LLM applications. Watermarking is an effective strategy to detect the LLM-generated content by encoding a pre-defined secret watermark to facilitate the detection process. However, the majority of existing watermark methods leverage the simple hashes of precedent tokens to partition vocabulary. Such watermark can be easily eliminated by paraphrase and correspondingly the detection effectiveness will be greatly compromised. Thus, to enhance the robustness against paraphrase, we propose a semantics-based watermark framework SemaMark. It leverages the semantics as an alternative to simple hashes of tokens since the paraphrase will likely preserve the semantic meaning of the sentences. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SemaMark under different paraphrases. ",

In this paper, we aim to combine the strengths of TNNs and SSMs by converting TNNs to SSMs during inference, thereby enabling TNNs to achieve the same constant inference complexities as SSMs. To accomplish this, we formulate the conversion process as an optimization problem and provide a closed-form solution.

To address the problem, we propose a self-supervised CIL framework CPPF, meaning Combining Past, Present and Future. In detail, CPPF consists of a prototype clustering module (PC), an embedding space reserving module (ESR) and a multi-teacher distillation module (MTD). 1) The PC and the ESR modules reserve embedding space for subsequent phases at the prototype level and the feature level respectively to prepare for knowledge learned in the future. 2) The MTD module maintains the representations of the current phase without the interference of past knowledge. One of the teacher networks retains the representations of the past phases, and the other teacher network distills relation information of the current phase to the student network. Extensive experiments on CIFAR100 and ImageNet100 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method boosts the performance of self-supervised class incremental learning.

Researchers have proposed many techniques and tools for source code clone detection, but current detection methods concentrate on analyzing or processing code samples individually without exploring the underlying connections among code samples. In this paper, we propose Gitor to capture the underlying connections among different code samples. Specifically, given a source code database, we first tokenize all code samples to extract the pre-defined individual information. After obtaining all samples individual information, we leverage them to build a large global sample graph where each node is a code sample or a type of individual information. Then we apply a node embedding technique on the global sample graph to extract all the samples vector representations. After collecting all code samples vectors, we can simply compare the similarity between any two samples to detect possible clone pairs. More importantly, since the obtained vector of a sample is from a global sample graph, we can combine it with its own code features to improve the code clone detection performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Gitor, we evaluate it on a widely used dataset namely BigCloneBench. Our experimental results show that Gitor has higher accuracy in terms of code clone detection and excellent execution time for inputs of various sizes compared to existing state-of-the-art tools. Moreover, we also evaluate the combination of Gitor with other traditional vector-based clone detection methods, the results show that the use of Gitor enables them detect more code clones with higher F1.

    "abstract": "Developing generalizable models that can effectively learn from limited data and with minimal reliance on human supervision is a significant objective within the machine learning community, particularly in the era of deep neural networks. Therefore, to achieve data-efficient learning, researchers typically explore approaches that can leverage more related or unlabeled data without necessitating additional manual labeling efforts, such as Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL), Transfer Learning (TL), and Data Augmentation (DA). SSL leverages unlabeled data in the training process, while TL enables the transfer of expertise from related data distributions. DA broadens the dataset by synthesizing new data from existing examples. However, the significance of additional knowledge contained within labels has been largely overlooked in research. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective on data efficiency that involves exploiting the semantic information contained in the labels of the available data. Specifically, we introduce a Language Semantic Graph (LSG) which is constructed from labels manifest as natural language descriptions. Upon this graph, an auxiliary graph neural network is trained to extract high-level semantic relations and then used to guide the training of the primary model, enabling more adequate utilization of label knowledge. Across image, video, and audio modalities, we utilize the LSG method in both TL and SSL scenarios and illustrate its versatility in significantly enhancing performance compared to other data-efficient learning approaches. Additionally, our in-depth analysis shows that the LSG method also expedites the training process. ",

The face de-identification technique is a practical way to solve the identity protection problem. The existing facial de-identification methods have revealed several problems, including the impact on the realism of anonymized results when faced with occlusions and the inability to maintain identity-irrelevant details in anonymized results. We present a High-Fidelity and Occlusion-Robust De-identification (HFORD) method to deal with these issues. This approach can disentangle identities and attributes while preserving image-specific details such as background, facial features (e.g., wrinkles), and lighting, even in occluded scenes. To disentangle the latent codes in the GAN inversion space, we introduce an Identity Disentanglement Module (IDM). This module selects the latent codes that are closely related to the identity. It further separates the latent codes into identity-related codes and attribute-related codes, enabling the network to preserve attributes while only modifying the identity. To ensure the preservation of image details and enhance the network's robustness to occlusions, we propose an Attribute Retention Module (ARM). This module adaptively preserves identity-irrelevant details and facial occlusions and blends them into the generated results in a modulated manner. Extensive experiments show that our method has higher quality, better detail fidelity, and stronger occlusion robustness than other face de-identification methods. ",

Despite these advances, efficient resource allocation in dynamic and complex networks remains a major challenge. This paper presents an experimental implementation of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) enhanced with graph neural networks (GNNs) on a real 5G testbed. The method addresses the explainability of GNNs by evaluating the importance of each edge in determining the model's output. The custom sampling functions feed the data into the proposed GNN-driven Monte Carlo policy gradient (REINFORCE) agent to optimize the gNodeB (gNB) radio resources according to the specific traffic demands.

However, with downstream tasks generally unknown at training time, it is difficult to deduce a priori which attributes of the data are indeed \"style\" and can be safely discarded. To address this, we introduce a more principled approach that seeks to disentangle style features rather than discard them. The key idea is to add multiple style embedding spaces where: (i) each is invariant to all-but-one augmentation; and (ii) joint entropy is maximized. We formalize our structured data-augmentation procedure from a causal latent-variable-model perspective, and prove identifiability of both content and (multiple blocks of) style variables. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of our approach on synthetic datasets and then present promising but limited results on ImageNet. ",

To address these challenges, we propose a new AE-based framework termed AEGM. Specifically, we first insert an auxiliary classifier into AE to enhance ASD in a multi-task learning manner. Then, we design a group-based decoder structure, accompanied by an adaptive loss function, to endow the model with domain-specific knowledge.

    "abstract": "Recent endeavors in video temporal grounding enforce strong cross-modal interactions through attention mechanisms to overcome the modality gap between video and text query. However, previous works treat all video clips equally regardless of their semantic relevance with the text query in attention modules. In this paper, our goal is to provide clues for query-associated video clips within the crossmodal encoding process. With our Correlation-Guided Detection Transformer~(CG-DETR), we explore the appropriate clip-wise degree of cross-modal interactions and how to exploit such degrees for prediction. First, we design an adaptive cross-attention layer with dummy tokens. Dummy tokens conditioned by text query take a portion of the attention weights, preventing irrelevant video clips from being represented by the text query. Yet, not all word tokens equally inherit the text query's correlation to video clips. Thus, we further guide the cross-attention map by inferring the fine-grained correlation between video clips and words. We enable this by learning a joint embedding space for high-level concepts, i.e., moment and sentence level, and inferring the clip-word correlation. Lastly, we use a moment-adaptive saliency detector to exploit each video clip's degrees of text engagement. We validate the superiority of CG-DETR with the state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks for both moment retrieval and highlight detection.

    "abstract": "Airborne hyperspectral images can be used to map the land cover in large urban areas, thanks to their very high spatial and spectral resolutions on a wide spectral domain. While the spectral dimension of hyperspectral images is highly informative of the chemical composition of the land surface, the use of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to map the land cover has been dramatically limited by the availability of training data. To cope with the scarcity of annotations, semi-supervised and self-supervised techniques have lately raised a lot of interest in the community. Yet, the publicly available hyperspectral data sets commonly used to benchmark machine learning models are not totally suited to evaluate their generalization performances due to one or several of the following properties: a limited geographical coverage (which does not reflect the spectral diversity in metropolitan areas), a small number of land cover classes and a lack of appropriate standard train / test splits for semi-supervised and self-supervised learning. Therefore, we release in this paper the Toulouse Hyperspectral Data Set that stands out from other data sets in the above-mentioned respects in order to meet key issues in spectral representation learning and classification over large-scale hyperspectral images with very few labeled pixels. Besides, we discuss and experiment the self-supervised task of Masked Autoencoders and establish a baseline for pixel-wise classification based on a conventional autoencoder combined with a Random Forest classifier achieving 82% overall accuracy and 74% F1 score.

    "title": "Towards Label Embedding -- Measuring classification difficulty",
    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification in machine learning is a timely and vast field of research. In supervised learning, uncertainty can already occur in the very first stage of the training process, the labelling step. In particular, this is the case when not every instance can be unambiguously classified. The problem occurs for classifying instances, where classes may overlap or instances can not be clearly categorised. In other words, there is inevitable ambiguity in the annotation step and not necessarily a 'ground truth'. We look exemplary at the classification of satellite images. Each image is annotated independently by multiple labellers and classified into local climate zones (LCZs). For each instance we have multiple votes, leading to a distribution of labels rather than a single value. The main idea of this work is that we do not assume a ground truth label but embed the votes into a K-dimensional space, with K as the number of possible categories. The embedding is derived from the voting distribution in a Bayesian setup, modelled via a Dirichlet-Multinomial model. We estimate the model and posteriors using a stochastic Expectation Maximisation algorithm with Markov Chain Monte Carlo steps. While we focus on the particular example of LCZ classification, the methods developed in this paper readily extend to other situations where multiple annotators independently label texts or images. We also apply our approach to two other benchmark datasets for image classification to demonstrate this. Besides the embeddings themselves, we can investigate the resulting correlation matrices, which can be seen as generalised confusion matrices and reflect the semantic similarities of the original classes very well for all three exemplary datasets. The insights gained are valuable and can serve as general label embedding if a single ground truth per observation cannot be guaranteed. ",

    "abstract": "Though the topic of causal inference is typically considered in the context of classical statistical models, recent years have seen great interest in extending causal inference techniques to quantum and generalized theories. Causal identification is a type of causal inference problem concerned with recovering from observational data and qualitative assumptions the causal mechanisms generating the data, and hence the effects of hypothetical interventions. A major obstacle to a theory of causal identification in the quantum setting is the question of what should play the role of \"observational data,\" as any means of extracting data at a certain locus will almost certainly disturb the system. Hence, one might think a priori that quantum measurements are already too much like interventions, so that the problem of causal identification trivializes. This is not the case. Fixing a limited class of quantum instruments (namely the class of all projective measurements) to play the role of \"observations,\" we note that as in the classical setting, there exist scenarios for which causal identification is not possible. We then present sufficient conditions for quantum causal identification, starting with a quantum analogue of the well-known \"front-door criterion\" and finishing with a broader class of scenarios for which the effect of a single intervention is identifiable. These results emerge from generalizing the process-theoretic account of classical causal inference due to Jacobs, Kissinger, and Zanasi beyond the setting of Markov categories, and thereby treating the classical and quantum problems uniformly.

To adapt SAM for shadow images, trainable adapters are inserted into the frozen image encoder of SAM, since the training of the full SAM model is both time and memory consuming. Moreover, we introduce a novel grid sampling method to generate dense point prompts, which helps to automatically segment shadows without any manual interventions.

Recent findings in deep learning for tabular data are now surpassing these classical methods by better handling the severe heterogeneity of data input features. Given the similar level of feature heterogeneity exhibited by ICU time-series and motivated by these findings, we explore these novel methods' impact on clinical sequence modeling tasks. By jointly using such advances in deep learning for tabular data, our primary objective is to underscore the importance of step-wise embeddings in time-series modeling, which remain unexplored in machine learning methods for clinical data.

However, they may block others' connections to the source by strategically cutting their outgoing edges to reduce their cost share, which may increase the total cost of connectivity. To minimize the total cost of connectivity, we design a cost sharing mechanism to incentivize each node to offer all its outgoing edges and each contractor to report all the edges' weights truthfully, and show the properties of the proposed mechanism.

Existing research primarily focuses on traditional homogeneous networks, which cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous information networks (HINs). However, existing research also has some limitations. For instance, either they solely focus on single-type or multi-type community search, which severely lacking flexibility, or they require users to specify meta-paths or predefined community structures, which poses significant challenges for users who are unfamiliar with community search and HINs. In this paper, we propose an innovative method, FCS-HGNN, that can flexibly identify either single-type or multi-type communities in HINs based on user preferences. We propose the heterogeneous information transformer to handle node heterogeneity, and the edge-semantic attention mechanism to address edge heterogeneity. This not only considers the varying contributions of edges when identifying different communities, but also expertly circumvents the challenges presented by meta-paths, thereby elegantly unifying the single-type and multi-type community search problems. Moreover, to enhance the applicability on large-scale graphs, we propose the neighbor sampling and depth-based heuristic search strategies, resulting in LS-FCS-HGNN. This algorithm significantly improves training and query efficiency while maintaining outstanding community effectiveness. We conducted extensive experiments on five real-world large-scale HINs, and the results demonstrated that the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

The task is particularly crucial in real-world applications, as it allows to avoid potentially harmful behaviours, e.g. as in the case of object detection models adopted in a self-driving car or in an autonomous robot. Traditional approaches to ND focus on one time offline post processing of the pretrained object detection output, leaving no possibility to improve the model robustness after training and discarding the abundant amount of out-of-distribution data encountered during deployment. In this work, we propose a novel framework for object-based ND, assuming that human feedback can be requested on the predicted output and later incorporated to refine the ND model without negatively affecting the main object detection performance. This refinement operation is repeated whenever new feedback is available. To tackle this new formulation of the problem for object detection, we propose a lightweight ND module attached on top of a pre-trained object detection model, which is incrementally updated through a feedback loop. We also propose a new benchmark to evaluate methods on this new setting and test extensively our ND approach against baselines, showing increased robustness and a successful incorporation of the received feedback.

This is accomplished through a comprehensive modeling framework centered around distributionally robust Markov decision processes (DRMDPs). This framework obliges the decision maker to choose an optimal policy under the worst-case distributional shift orchestrated by an adversary. By unifying and extending existing formulations, we rigorously construct DRMDPs that embraces various modeling attributes for both the decision maker and the adversary. These attributes include adaptability granularity, exploring history-dependent, Markov, and Markov time-homogeneous decision maker and adversary dynamics. Additionally, we delve into the flexibility of shifts induced by the adversary, examining SA and S-rectangularity. Within this DRMDP framework, we investigate conditions for the existence or absence of the dynamic programming principle (DPP). From an algorithmic standpoint, the existence of DPP holds significant implications, as the vast majority of existing data and computationally efficiency RL algorithms are reliant on the DPP.

    "abstract": "Code review is an important process for quality assurance in software development. For an effective code review, the reviewers must explain their feedback to enable the authors of the code change to act on them. However, the explanation needs may differ among developers, who may require different types of explanations. It is therefore crucial to understand what kind of explanations reviewers usually use in code reviews. To the best of our knowledge, no study published to date has analyzed the types of explanations used in code review. In this study, we present the first analysis of explanations in useful code reviews. We extracted a set of code reviews based on their usefulness and labeled them based on whether they contained an explanation, a solution, or both a proposed solution and an explanation thereof. Based on our analysis, we found that a significant portion of the code review comments (46%) only include solutions without providing an explanation. We further investigated the remaining 54% of code review comments containing an explanation and conducted an open card sorting to categorize the reviewers' explanations. We distilled seven distinct categories of explanations based on the expression forms developers used. Then, we utilize large language models, specifically ChatGPT, to assist developers in getting a code review explanation that suits their preferences. Specifically, we created prompts to transform a code review explanation into a specific type of explanation. Our evaluation results show that ChatGPT correctly generated the specified type of explanation in 88/90 cases and that 89/90 of the cases have the correct explanation. Overall, our study provides insights into the types of explanations that developers use in code review and showcases how ChatGPT can be leveraged during the code review process to generate a specific type of explanation.

Reward machines offer a powerful tool to express complex reward structures in RL tasks, enabling the design of tailored reinforcement signals that align with mission objectives.

To more effectively prevent unintentional opioid overdoses, medical practitioners require robust and timely tools that can effectively identify at-risk patients. Community-based social media platforms such as Reddit allow self-disclosure for users to discuss otherwise sensitive drug-related behaviors, often acting as indicators for opioid use disorder. Towards this, we present a moderate size corpus of 2500 opioid-related posts from various subreddits spanning 6 different phases of opioid use: Medical Use, Misuse, Addiction, Recovery, Relapse, Not Using. For every post, we annotate span-level extractive explanations and crucially study their role both in annotation quality and model development. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models in a supervised, few-shot, or zero-shot setting. Experimental results and error analysis show that identifying the phases of opioid use disorder is highly contextual and challenging. However, we find that using explanations during modeling leads to a significant boost in classification accuracy demonstrating their beneficial role in a high-stakes domain such as studying the opioid use disorder continuum. The dataset will be made available for research on Github in the formal version. ",

MLPs are continuous functions, however, real geometry or density field is frequently discontinuous at the interface between the air and the surface. Such a contrary brings the problem of unfaithful geometry representation. To this end, this paper proposes spiking NeRF, which leverages spiking neuron and a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-Spiking Neural Network (SNN) framework to build a discontinuous density field for faithful geometry representation. Specifically, we first demonstrate the reason why continuous density fields will bring inaccuracy. Then, we propose to use the spiking neurons to build a discontinuous density field. We conduct comprehensive analysis for the problem of existing spiking neuron models and then provide the numerical relationship between the parameter of spiking neuron and the theoretical accuracy of geometry, Based on this, we propose a bounded spiking neuron to build the discontinuous density field. Our results achieve SOTA performance. Our code and data will be released to the public. ",

While the impact of these biases has been recognized, prior methods for bias evaluation have been limited to binary association tests on small datasets, offering a constrained view of the nature of societal biases within language models. In this paper, we propose an original framework for probing language models for societal biases. We collect a probing dataset to analyze language models' general associations, as well as along the axes of societal categories, identities, and stereotypes. To this end, we leverage a novel perplexity-based fairness score. We curate a large-scale benchmarking dataset addressing drawbacks and limitations of existing fairness collections, expanding to a variety of different identities and stereotypes. When comparing our methodology with prior work, we demonstrate that biases within language models are more nuanced than previously acknowledged. In agreement with recent findings, we find that larger model variants exhibit a higher degree of bias. Moreover, we expose how identities expressing different religions lead to the most pronounced disparate treatments across all models. ",

With the invention of algebraic fast matrix multiplication over 50 years ago, it also became known that BMM can be solved in truly subcubic $O(n^\\omega)$ time, where $\\omega<3$; much work has gone into bringing $\\omega$ closer to $2$. Since then, a parallel line of work has sought comparably fast combinatorial algorithms but with limited success. The naive $O(n^3)$-time algorithm was initially improved by a $\\log^2{n}$ factor [Arlazarov et al.; RAS'70], then by $\\log^{2.25}{n}$ [Bansal and Williams; FOCS'09], then by $\\log^3{n}$ [Chan; SODA'15], and finally by $\\log^4{n}$ [Yu; ICALP'15]. We design a combinatorial algorithm for BMM running in time $n^3 / 2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt[7]{\\log n})}$ -- a speed-up over cubic time that is stronger than any poly-log factor. This comes tantalizingly close to refuting the conjecture from the 90s that truly subcubic combinatorial algorithms for BMM are impossible. This popular conjecture is the basis for dozens of fine-grained hardness results. Our main technical contribution is a new regularity decomposition theorem for Boolean matrices (or equivalently, bipartite graphs) under a notion of regularity that was recently introduced and analyzed analytically in the context of communication complexity [Kelley, Lovett, Meka; arXiv'23], and is related to a similar notion from the recent work on $3$-term arithmetic progression free sets [Kelley, Meka; FOCS'23].

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance in their capabilities, yet this progress is accompanied by a growing array of safety risks. While significant attention has been dedicated to exploiting weaknesses in LLMs through jailbreaking attacks, there remains a paucity of exploration into defending against these attacks. We point out a pivotal factor contributing to the success of jailbreaks: the inherent conflict between the goals of being helpful and ensuring safety. To counter jailbreaking attacks, we propose to integrate goal prioritization at both training and inference stages. Implementing goal prioritization during inference substantially diminishes the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of jailbreaking attacks, reducing it from 66.4% to 2.0% for ChatGPT and from 68.2% to 19.4% for Vicuna-33B, without compromising general performance. Furthermore, integrating the concept of goal prioritization into the training phase reduces the ASR from 71.0% to 6.6% for LLama2-13B. Remarkably, even in scenarios where no jailbreaking samples are included during training, our approach slashes the ASR by half, decreasing it from 71.0% to 34.0%. Additionally, our findings reveal that while stronger LLMs face greater safety risks, they also possess a greater capacity to be steered towards defending against such attacks. We hope our work could contribute to the comprehension of jailbreaking attacks and defenses, and shed light on the relationship between LLMs' capability and safety.

This method involves the calculated Hessian orientations of the investigated image while computing its SSRT, in such a way that linear structures are emphasized in the SSRT space. As a consequence, the subsequent maxima detection in the SSRT space is done on a modified transform space freed from unwanted parts and, consequently, from irrelevant peaks that usually drown the peaks representing lines. Besides, highlighting the linear structure in the SSRT space permitting, thus, to efficiently detect lines of different thickness in synthetic and real images, the experiments show also the method robustness against noise and complex background.

In this paper, we define and characterize the context that is required to fully understand such ambiguous statements in a computational setting and ground them in real-world entities, actions, and attitudes. To that end, we propose two challenging datasets that require an understanding of the real-world context of the text to be solved effectively. We benchmark these datasets against baselines built upon large pre-trained models such as BERT, RoBERTa, GPT-3, etc. Additionally, we develop and benchmark more structured baselines building upon existing 'Discourse Contextualization Framework' and 'Political Actor Representation' models.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) consist of links that describe relationships between entities. Due to the difficulty of manually enumerating all relationships between entities, automatically completing them is essential for KGs. Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is a task that infers unseen relationships between entities in a KG. Traditional embedding-based KGC methods, such as RESCAL, TransE, DistMult, ComplEx, RotatE, HAKE, HousE, etc., infer missing links using only the knowledge from training data. In contrast, the recent Pre-trained Language Model (PLM)-based KGC utilizes knowledge obtained during pre-training. Therefore, PLM-based KGC can estimate missing links between entities by reusing memorized knowledge from pre-training without inference. This approach is problematic because building KGC models aims to infer unseen links between entities. However, conventional evaluations in KGC do not consider inference and memorization abilities separately. Thus, a PLM-based KGC method, which achieves high performance in current KGC evaluations, may be ineffective in practical applications. To address this issue, we analyze whether PLM-based KGC methods make inferences or merely access memorized knowledge. For this purpose, we propose a method for constructing synthetic datasets specified in this analysis and conclude that PLMs acquire the inference abilities required for KGC through pre-training, even though the performance improvements mostly come from textual information of entities and relations.

Through carefully designed dialogue, we successfully steal the internal system prompts of GPT-4V.

Results show that appropriately designed system prompts can significantly reduce jailbreak success rates.

As input, it requires system samples drawn from a grid of the parameter whose change is associated with potential phase transitions. Up to now, the scheme required training a distinct binary classifier for each possible splitting of the grid into two sides, resulting in a computational cost that scales linearly with the number of grid points. In this work, we propose and showcase an alternative implementation that only requires the training of a single multi-class classifier. Ideally, such multi-task learning eliminates the scaling with respect to the number of grid points.

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a recent technique to improve the quality of the text generated by a language model, making it closer to what humans would generate. A core ingredient in RLHF's success in aligning and improving large language models (LLMs) is its reward model, trained using human feedback on model outputs. In machine translation (MT), where metrics trained from human annotations can readily be used as reward models, recent methods using minimum Bayes risk decoding and reranking have succeeded in improving the final quality of translation. In this study, we comprehensively explore and compare techniques for integrating quality metrics as reward models into the MT pipeline. This includes using the reward model for data filtering, during the training phase through RL, and at inference time by employing reranking techniques, and we assess the effects of combining these in a unified approach. Our experimental results, conducted across multiple translation tasks, underscore the crucial role of effective data filtering, based on estimated quality, in harnessing the full potential of RL in enhancing MT quality. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of combining RL training with reranking techniques, showcasing substantial improvements in translation quality. ",

    "abstract": "The current best practice approach for the retrospective diagnosis of adverse drug events (ADEs) in hospitalized patients relies on a full patient chart review and a formal causality assessment by multiple medical experts. This evaluation serves to qualitatively estimate the probability of causation (PC); the probability that a drug was a necessary cause of an adverse event. This practice is manual, resource intensive and prone to human biases, and may thus benefit from data-driven decision support. Here, we pioneer a causal modeling approach using observational data to estimate a lower bound of the PC (PC$_{low}$). This method includes two key causal inference components: (1) the target trial emulation framework and (2) estimation of individualized treatment effects using machine learning. We apply our method to the clinically relevant use-case of vancomycin-induced acute kidney injury in intensive care patients, and compare our causal model-based PC$_{low}$ estimates to qualitative estimates of the PC provided by a medical expert. Important limitations and potential improvements are discussed, and we conclude that future improved causal models could provide essential data-driven support for medication safety monitoring in hospitalized patients.

However, there is always a risk of patients being subject to the wrong diagnosis or to a certain treatment not pertaining to the desired effect, potentially leading to adverse events. Our research aims to develop an anomaly detection system for identifying deviations from expected clinical trajectories. To address this goal we analyzed 16 months of vital sign recordings obtained from the Nordland Hospital Trust (NHT). We employed an self-supervised framework based on the STraTS transformer architecture to represent the time series data in a latent space. These representations were then subjected to various clustering techniques to explore potential patient phenotypes based on their clinical progress. While our preliminary results from this ongoing research are promising, they underscore the importance of enhancing the dataset with additional demographic information from patients. This additional data will be crucial for a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's performance. ",

    "abstract": "The era of ubiquitous, affordable wireless connectivity has opened doors to countless practical applications. In this context, ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) stands out, utilizing passive tags to establish connections with readers by harnessing reflected ambient radio frequency (RF) signals. However, conventional data detectors face limitations due to their inadequate knowledge of channel and RF-source parameters. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative approach using a deep neural network (DNN) for channel state estimation (CSI) and signal detection within AmBC systems. Unlike traditional methods that separate CSI estimation and data detection, our approach leverages a DNN to implicitly estimate CSI and simultaneously detect data. The DNN model, trained offline using simulated data derived from channel statistics, excels in online data recovery, ensuring robust performance in practical scenarios. Comprehensive evaluations validate the superiority of our proposed DNN method over traditional detectors, particularly in terms of bit error rate (BER). In high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, our method exhibits an impressive approximately 20% improvement in BER performance compared to the maximum likelihood (ML) approach. These results underscore the effectiveness of our developed approach for AmBC channel estimation and signal detection. In summary, our method outperforms traditional detectors, bolstering the reliability and efficiency of AmBC systems, even in challenging channel conditions. ",

Experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs face challenges comprehending abstraction knowledge in zero-shot and few-shot settings. By training on our rich abstraction knowledge, we find LLMs can acquire basic abstraction abilities and generalize to unseen events.

We first show that directly applying the expansion techniques in the current literature to state-of-the-art neural rankers can result in deteriorated zero-shot performance. To this end, we propose GFF, a pipeline that includes a large language model and a neural ranker, to Generate, Filter, and Fuse query expansions more effectively in order to improve the zero-shot ranking metrics such as nDCG@10. Specifically, GFF first calls an instruction-following language model to generate query-related keywords through a reasoning chain. Leveraging self-consistency and reciprocal rank weighting, GFF further filters and combines the ranking results of each expanded query dynamically. By utilizing this pipeline, we show that GFF can improve the zero-shot nDCG@10 on BEIR and TREC DL 2019/2020. We also analyze different modelling choices in the GFF pipeline and shed light on the future directions in query expansion for zero-shot neural rankers. ",

    "abstract": "A significant bottleneck in applying current reinforcement learning algorithms to real-world scenarios is the need to reset the environment between every episode. This reset process demands substantial human intervention, making it difficult for the agent to learn continuously and autonomously. Several recent works have introduced autonomous reinforcement learning (ARL) algorithms that generate curricula for jointly training reset and forward policies. While their curricula can reduce the number of required manual resets by taking into account the agent's learning progress, they rely on task-specific knowledge, such as predefined initial states or reset reward functions. In this paper, we propose a novel ARL algorithm that can generate a curriculum adaptive to the agent's learning progress without task-specific knowledge. Our curriculum empowers the agent to autonomously reset to diverse and informative initial states. To achieve this, we introduce a success discriminator that estimates the success probability from each initial state when the agent follows the forward policy. The success discriminator is trained with relabeled transitions in a self-supervised manner. Our experimental results demonstrate that our ARL algorithm can generate an adaptive curriculum and enable the agent to efficiently bootstrap to solve sparse-reward maze navigation tasks, outperforming baselines with significantly fewer manual resets.

    "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) represent a substantial advancement in the capabilities of large language models, notably in reducing factual hallucination by leveraging external knowledge sources. However, the reliability of the retrieved information is not always guaranteed. The retrieval of irrelevant data can lead to misguided responses, and potentially causing the model to overlook its inherent knowledge, even when it possesses adequate information to address the query. Moreover, standard RALMs often struggle to assess whether they possess adequate knowledge, both intrinsic and retrieved, to provide an accurate answer. In situations where knowledge is lacking, these systems should ideally respond with \"unknown\" when the answer is unattainable. In response to these challenges, we introduces Chain-of-Noting (CoN), a novel approach aimed at improving the robustness of RALMs in facing noisy, irrelevant documents and in handling unknown scenarios. The core idea of CoN is to generate sequential reading notes for retrieved documents, enabling a thorough evaluation of their relevance to the given question and integrating this information to formulate the final answer. We employed ChatGPT to create training data for CoN, which was subsequently trained on an LLaMa-2 7B model. Our experiments across four open-domain QA benchmarks show that RALMs equipped with CoN significantly outperform standard RALMs. Notably, CoN achieves an average improvement of +7.9 in EM score given entirely noisy retrieved documents and +10.5 in rejection rates for real-time questions that fall outside the pre-training knowledge scope.

A publicly available BOLD5000 dataset is utilized that contains fMRI scans while viewing 5254 images of diverse complexities. The objective of this study is to examine how network topology differs in response to distinct visual stimuli from these visual datasets. To achieve this, 0- and 1-dimensional persistence diagrams are computed for each visual network representing COCO, ImageNet, and SUN. For extracting suitable features from topological persistence diagrams, K-means clustering is executed. The extracted K-means cluster features are fed to a novel deep-hybrid model that yields accuracy in the range of 90%-95% in classifying these visual networks. To understand vision, this type of visual network categorization across visual datasets is important as it captures differences in BOLD signals while perceiving images with different contexts and complexities. Furthermore, distinctive topological patterns of visual network associated with each dataset, as revealed from this study, could potentially lead to the development of future neuroimaging biomarkers for diagnosing visual processing disorders like visual agnosia or prosopagnosia, and tracking changes in visual cognition over time.

Optical flow is used to successfully measure breathing rate by tracking the motion of specific points on the body. In this study, the success of optical flow when using different sets of points is evaluated. Testing shows that both chest and facial movement can be used to determine breathing rate but to different degrees of success. The chest generates very accurate signals, with an RMSE of 0.63 on the tested videos. Facial points can also generate reliable signals when there is minimal head movement but are much more vulnerable to noise caused by head/body movements. These findings highlight the potential of optical flow as a non-invasive method for breathing rate detection and emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate points to optimize accuracy. ",

The genomic and phenotypic data (3,408 cases and 4,739 controls) for this study were gathered from participants in Mayo Clinic Tapestry Study (IRB#19-000001) and their electric health records, including their demographic, clinical, and comorbidity data, and the genotype information through whole exome sequencing performed at Helix using the Exome+$^\\circledR$ Assay according to standard procedure (www$.$helix$.$com). Factors highly relevant to NAFLD were determined by the chi-square test and stepwise backward-forward regression model. Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed on NAFLD cases using significant indicator variables to identify subgroups. The optimal clustering revealed 5 latent subgroups from 2,013 NAFLD patients (mean age 60.6 years and 62.1% women), while a polygenic risk score based on 6 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants and disease outcomes were used to analyze the subgroups. The groups are characterized by metabolic syndrome, obesity, different comorbidities, psychoneurological factors, and genetic factors. Odds ratios were utilized to compare the risk of complex diseases, such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as liver failure between the clusters.

    "abstract": "Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a promising modulation scheme for wireless communication in high-mobility scenarios. Recently, a reservoir computing (RC) based approach has been introduced for online subframe-based symbol detection in the OTFS system, where only a limited number of over-the-air (OTA) pilot symbols are utilized for training. However, this approach does not leverage the domain knowledge specific to the OTFS system. This paper introduces a novel two-dimensional RC (2D-RC) method that incorporates the structural knowledge of the OTFS system into the design for online symbol detection on a subframe basis. Specifically, as the channel response acts as a two-dimensional (2D) operation over the transmitted information symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, the 2D-RC is designed to have a 2D structure to equalize the channel. With the introduced architecture, the 2D-RC can benefit from the predictable channel representation in the DD domain. Moreover, unlike the previous work that requires multiple RCs to learn the channel feature, the 2D-RC only requires a single neural network for detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the 2D-RC approach across different OTFS system variants and modulation orders. ",

    "abstract": "When dealing with overlapped speech, the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems substantially degrades as they are designed for single-talker speech. To enhance ASR performance in conversational or meeting environments, continuous speaker separation (CSS) is commonly employed. However, CSS requires a short separation window to avoid many speakers inside the window and sequential grouping of discontinuous speech segments. To address these limitations, we introduce a new multi-channel framework called \"speaker separation via neural diarization\" (SSND) for meeting environments. Our approach utilizes an end-to-end diarization system to identify the speech activity of each individual speaker. By leveraging estimated speaker boundaries, we generate a sequence of embeddings, which in turn facilitate the assignment of speakers to the outputs of a multi-talker separation model. SSND addresses the permutation ambiguity issue of talker-independent speaker separation during the diarization phase through location-based training, rather than during the separation process. This unique approach allows multiple non-overlapped speakers to be assigned to the same output stream, making it possible to efficiently process long segments-a task impossible with CSS. Additionally, SSND is naturally suitable for speaker-attributed ASR. We evaluate our proposed diarization and separation methods on the open LibriCSS dataset, advancing state-of-the-art diarization and ASR results by a large margin. ",

Some of this work can be accomplished as it has been done in the past, but some aspects present us with challenges which traditional knowledge and tools cannot adequately resolve. One such challenge is presented by species complexes in which the morphological similarities among the group members make it difficult to reliably identify known species and detect new ones. We address this challenge by developing new tools using the principles of machine learning to resolve two specific questions related to species complexes. The first question is formulated as a classification problem in statistics and machine learning and the second question is an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem. We apply these tools to a species complex comprising Southeast Asian stream frogs (Limnonectes kuhlii complex) and employ a morphological character (hind limb skin texture) traditionally treated qualitatively in a quantitative and objective manner. We demonstrate that deep neural networks can successfully automate the classification of an image into a known species group for which it has been trained. We further demonstrate that the algorithm can successfully classify an image into a new class if the image does not belong to the existing classes.

    "abstract": "Influence Maximization(IM) aims to identify highly influential nodes to maximize influence spread in a network. Previous research on the IM problem has mainly concentrated on single-layer networks, disregarding the comprehension of the coupling structure that is inherent in multilayer networks. To solve the IM problem in multilayer networks, we first propose an independent cascade model (MIC) in a multilayer network where propagation occurs simultaneously across different layers. Consequently, a heuristic algorithm, i.e., Adaptive Coupling Degree (ACD), which selects seed nodes with high spread influence and a low degree of overlap of influence, is proposed to identify seed nodes for IM in a multilayer network. By conducting experiments based on MIC, we have demonstrated that our proposed method is superior to the baselines in terms of influence spread and time cost in 6 synthetic and 4 real-world multilayer networks.

    "abstract": "The channel estimation (CE) in wireless receivers is one of the most critical and computationally complex signal processing operations. Recently, various works have shown that the deep learning (DL) based CE outperforms conventional minimum mean square error (MMSE) based CE, and it is hardware-friendly. However, DL-based CE has higher complexity and latency than popularly used least square (LS) based CE. In this work, we propose a novel low complexity high-speed Deep Neural Network-Augmented Least Square (LC-LSDNN) algorithm for IEEE 802.11p wireless physical layer and efficiently implement it on Zynq system on chip (ZSoC). The novelty of the LC-LSDNN is to use different DNNs for real and imaginary values of received complex symbols. This helps reduce the size of DL by 59% and optimize the critical path, allowing it to operate at 60% higher clock frequency. We also explore three different architectures for MMSE-based CE. We show that LC-LSDNN significantly outperforms MMSE and state-of-the-art DL-based CE for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and different wireless channels. Also, it is computationally efficient, with around 50% lower resources than existing DL-based CE. ",

    "abstract": "The ageing society brings attention to daily elderly care through sensing technologies. The future smart home is expected to enable in-home daily monitoring, such as fall detection, for seniors in a non-invasive, non-cooperative, and non-contact manner. The mmWave radar is a promising candidate technology for its privacy-preserving and non-contact manner. However, existing solutions suffer from low accuracy and robustness due to environment dependent features. In this paper, we present FADE (\\underline{FA}ll \\underline{DE}tection), a practical fall detection radar system with enhanced accuracy and robustness in real-world scenarios. The key enabler underlying FADE is an interacting multiple model (IMM) state estimator that can extract environment-independent features for highly accurate and instantaneous fall detection. Furthermore, we proposed a robust multiple-user tracking system to deal with noises from the environment and other human bodies. We deployed our algorithm on low computing power and low power consumption system-on-chip (SoC) composed of data front end, DSP, and ARM processor, and tested its performance in real-world. The experiment shows that the accuracy of fall detection is up to 95\\%. ",

In this paper, we study the phase retrieval problem under the prior that the signal lies in a semi-algebraic set. This is a very general prior as semi-algebraic sets include linear models, sparse models, and ReLU neural network generative models. The latter is the main motivation of this paper, due to the remarkable success of deep generative models in a variety of imaging tasks, including phase retrieval. We prove that almost all signals in R^N can be determined from their Fourier magnitudes, up to a sign, if they lie in a (generic) semi-algebraic set of dimension N/2. The same is true for all signals if the semi-algebraic set is of dimension N/4. We also generalize these results to the problem of signal recovery from the second moment in multi-reference alignment models with multiplicity free representations of compact groups. This general result is then used to derive improved sample complexity bounds for recovering band-limited functions on the sphere from their noisy copies, each acted upon by a random element of SO(3).

    "abstract": "The majority of primary Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors in the brain are among the most aggressive diseases affecting humans. Early detection of brain tumor types, whether benign or malignant, glial or non-glial, is critical for cancer prevention and treatment, ultimately improving human life expectancy. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) stands as the most effective technique to detect brain tumors by generating comprehensive brain images through scans. However, human examination can be error-prone and inefficient due to the complexity, size, and location variability of brain tumors. Recently, automated classification techniques using machine learning (ML) methods, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), have demonstrated significantly higher accuracy than manual screening, while maintaining low computational costs. Nonetheless, deep learning-based image classification methods, including CNN, face challenges in estimating class probabilities without proper model calibration. In this paper, we propose a novel brain tumor image classification method, called SIBOW-SVM, which integrates the Bag-of-Features (BoF) model with SIFT feature extraction and weighted Support Vector Machines (wSVMs). This new approach effectively captures hidden image features, enabling the differentiation of various tumor types and accurate label predictions. Additionally, the SIBOW-SVM is able to estimate the probabilities of images belonging to each class, thereby providing high-confidence classification decisions. We have also developed scalable and parallelable algorithms to facilitate the practical implementation of SIBOW-SVM for massive images. As a benchmark, we apply the SIBOW-SVM to a public data set of brain tumor MRI images containing four classes: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and normal. Our results show that the new method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including CNN. ",

We give a necessary and sufficient condition for an edge-coloured graph $G^c$ to have a properly coloured $f$-factor. We state and prove our result in terms of an auxiliary graph $G_f^c$ which has a 1-factor if and only if $G^c$ has a properly coloured $f$-factor; this is analogous to the \"short proof\" of the $f$-factor theorem given by Tutte in 1954. An alternative statement, analogous to the original $f$-factor theorem, is also given. We show that our theorem generalises the $f$-factor theorem; that is, the former implies the latter. We consider other properties of edge-coloured graphs, and show that similar results are unlikely for $f$-factors with rainbow components and distance-$d$-coloured $f$-factors, even when $d=2$ and the number of colours used is asymptotically minimal.
