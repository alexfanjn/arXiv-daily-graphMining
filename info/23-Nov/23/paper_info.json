    "title": "Understanding Data Augmentation from a Robustness Perspective",
    "abstract": "In the realm of visual recognition, data augmentation stands out as a pivotal technique to amplify model robustness. Yet, a considerable number of existing methodologies lean heavily on heuristic foundations, rendering their intrinsic mechanisms ambiguous. This manuscript takes both a theoretical and empirical approach to understanding the phenomenon. Theoretically, we frame the discourse around data augmentation within game theory's constructs. Venturing deeper, our empirical evaluations dissect the intricate mechanisms of emblematic data augmentation strategies, illuminating that these techniques primarily stimulate mid- and high-order game interactions. Beyond the foundational exploration, our experiments span multiple datasets and diverse augmentation techniques, underscoring the universal applicability of our findings. Recognizing the vast array of robustness metrics with intricate correlations, we unveil a streamlined proxy. This proxy not only simplifies robustness assessment but also offers invaluable insights, shedding light on the inherent dynamics of model game interactions and their relation to overarching system robustness. These insights provide a novel lens through which we can re-evaluate model safety and robustness in visual recognition tasks. ",

From the 62,534 papers in the areas of batteries, catalysis, and MOFs, 501,045 figures were mined. Remarkably, our tool showcased performance with over 99% accuracy in legend marker and text detection. Moreover, its capability for data line separation stood at 66%, which is much higher compared to other existing figure mining tools.

    "abstract": "In CFD, mesh smoothing methods are commonly utilized to refine the mesh quality to achieve high-precision numerical simulations. Specifically, optimization-based smoothing is used for high-quality mesh smoothing, but it incurs significant computational overhead. Pioneer works improve its smoothing efficiency by adopting supervised learning to learn smoothing methods from high-quality meshes. However, they pose difficulty in smoothing the mesh nodes with varying degrees and also need data augmentation to address the node input sequence problem. Additionally, the required labeled high-quality meshes further limit the applicability of the proposed method. In this paper, we present GMSNet, a lightweight neural network model for intelligent mesh smoothing. GMSNet adopts graph neural networks to extract features of the node's neighbors and output the optimal node position. During smoothing, we also introduce a fault-tolerance mechanism to prevent GMSNet from generating negative volume elements. With a lightweight model, GMSNet can effectively smoothing mesh nodes with varying degrees and remain unaffected by the order of input data. A novel loss function, MetricLoss, is also developed to eliminate the need for high-quality meshes, which provides a stable and rapid convergence during training. We compare GMSNet with commonly used mesh smoothing methods on two-dimensional triangle meshes. The experimental results show that GMSNet achieves outstanding mesh smoothing performances with 5% model parameters of the previous model, and attains 8.62 times faster than optimization-based smoothing.

We also explore the RDC frontier, which leads to a family of model architectures with the best empirical trade-off between computational requirements and RD performance. Finally, we identify a novel neural compression architecture that yields state-of-the-art RD performance with rate savings of 23.1% over BPG (7.0% over VTM and 3.0% over ELIC) without requiring significantly more FLOPs than other learning-based codecs.

Generally, the gradient-based optimizers converge to the global solution very accurately, but they often require a large number of iterations to find the solution. Researchers took inspiration from different natural phenomena and behaviours of many living organisms to develop algorithms that can solve optimization problems much quicker with high accuracy. These algorithms are called nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimization algorithms. These can be used for denoising signals, updating weights in a deep neural network, and many other cases. In the state-of-the-art, there are no systematic reviews available that have discussed the applications of nature-inspired algorithms on biomedical signal processing. The paper solves that gap by discussing the applications of such algorithms in biomedical signal processing and also provides an updated survey of the application of these algorithms in biomedical image processing. The paper reviews 28 latest peer-reviewed relevant articles and 26 nature-inspired algorithms and segregates them into thoroughly explored, lesser explored and unexplored categories intending to help readers understand the reliability and exploration stage of each of these algorithms.

The state-of-the-art neural compression solution, neurcomp, however, utilizes a single large multilayer perceptron (MLP) to encode the global volume, incurring slow training and inference. This paper presents an efficient compressive neural representation (ECNR) solution that improves upon neurcomp to handle large-scale time-varying datasets. At the heart of our approach is a multiscale structure that uses the Laplacian pyramid for adaptive signal fitting via implicit neural representation. We leverage multiple small MLPs at each scale for fitting local content or residual blocks. By assigning similar blocks to the same MLP via size uniformization, we enable balanced parallelization among MLPs to significantly speed up training and inference. A deep compression strategy is then employed to compact the resulting model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ECNR with multiple datasets and compare it with neurcomp and two state-of-the-art conventional compression methods (SZ3 and TTHRESH). Our results position ECNR as a promising alternative to neurcomp for scientific data compression. ",

    "abstract": "As the globalization of semiconductor design and manufacturing processes continues, the demand for defect detection during integrated circuit fabrication stages is becoming increasingly critical, playing a significant role in enhancing the yield of semiconductor products. Traditional wafer map defect pattern detection methods involve manual inspection using electron microscopes to collect sample images, which are then assessed by experts for defects. This approach is labor-intensive and inefficient. Consequently, there is a pressing need to develop a model capable of automatically detecting defects as an alternative to manual operations. In this paper, we propose a method that initially employs a pre-trained VAE model to obtain the fault distribution information of the wafer map. This information serves as guidance, combined with the original image set for semi-supervised model training. During the semi-supervised training, we utilize a teacher-student network for iterative learning. The model presented in this paper is validated on the benchmark dataset WM-811K wafer dataset. The experimental results demonstrate superior classification accuracy and detection performance compared to state-of-the-art models, fulfilling the requirements for industrial applications.

    "abstract": "The extend of tool wear significantly affects blanking processes and has a decisive impact on product quality and productivity. For this reason, numerous scientists have addressed their research to wear monitoring systems in order to identify or even predict critical wear at an early stage. Existing approaches are mainly based on indirect monitoring using time series, which are used to detect critical wear states via thresholds or machine learning models. Nevertheless, differentiation between types of wear phenomena affecting the tool during blanking as well as quantification of worn surfaces is still limited in practice. While time series data provides partial insights into wear occurrence and evolution, direct monitoring techniques utilizing image data offer a more comprehensive perspective and increased robustness when dealing with varying process parameters. However, acquiring and processing this data in real-time is challenging. In particular, high dynamics combined with increasing strokes rates as well as the high dimensionality of image data have so far prevented the development of direct image-based monitoring systems. For this reason, this paper demonstrates how high-resolution images of tools at 600 spm can be captured and subsequently processed using semantic segmentation deep learning algorithms, more precisely Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN). 125,000 images of the tool are taken from successive strokes, and microscope images are captured to investigate the worn surfaces. Based on findings from the microscope images, selected images are labeled pixel by pixel according to their wear condition and used to train a FCN (U-Net). ",

To address these issues, this research, therefore, proposed a novel and hybrid-focused detection approach based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients and PC Neural Net (PCNN) structure. The proposed approach partially resolves the limitations of the existing contrast schemes to detect in-focused smooth objects from the out-of-focused smooth regions in the defocus dataset.

Moreover, license plates are often intentionally tampered with a malicious intent to avoid police apprehension. Usually, such groups and individuals know how to fool the existing recognition systems by making minor unnoticeable plate changes. Designing and developing deep learning methods resilient to such real-world 'attack' practices remains an active research problem. As a solution, this work develops a resilient method to recognize license plate characters. Extracting 1057 character images from 160 Nepalese vehicles, as the first step, we trained several standard deep convolutional neural networks to obtain 99.5% character classification accuracy. On adversarial images generated to simulate malicious tampering, however, our model's accuracy dropped to 25%. Next, we enriched our dataset by generating and adding geometrically masked images, retrained our models, and investigated the models' predictions. The proposed approach of training with generated adversarial images helped our adversarial attack-aware license plate character recognition (AA-LPCR) model achieves an accuracy of 99.7%. This near-perfect accuracy demonstrates that the proposed idea of random geometric masking is highly effective for improving the accuracy of license plate recognition models. Furthermore, by performing interpretability studies to understand why our models work, we identify and highlight attack-prone regions in the input character images. In sum, although Nepal's embossed license plate detection systems are vulnerable to malicious attacks, our findings suggest that these systems can be upgraded to close to 100% resilience. ",

As a cutting-edge approach, RAE scheme can serve the purposes of preventing unauthorized users from engaging in malicious model training, as well as ensuring the legitimate usage of authorized users.

It diffuses datasets into a Biased Gaussian Distribution (BGD) and utilizes the prior knowledge of the DDPM for generating and recovering RAEs. The experimental results demonstrate that RAEDiff effectively self-generates adversarial perturbations for DNN models, including Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) models, while also exhibiting significant self-recovery capabilities.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a vision-based planning system that combines tracking and trajectory prediction of dynamic obstacles to achieve efficient and reliable autonomous flight. We use a lightweight object detection algorithm to identify dynamic obstacles and then use Kalman Filtering to track and estimate their motion states. During the planning phase, we not only consider static obstacles but also account for the potential movements of dynamic obstacles. For trajectory generation, we use a B-spline-based trajectory search algorithm, which is further optimized with various constraints to enhance safety and alignment with the UAV's motion characteristics. We conduct experiments in both simulation and real-world environments, and the results indicate that our approach can successfully detect and avoid obstacles in dynamic environments in real-time, offering greater reliability compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, with the advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology demonstrating exceptional zero-shot generalization capabilities, more user-friendly human-machine interactions have become feasible, and this study also explores the integration of autonomous planning systems with Large Language Models (LLMs).

    "abstract": "In novel view synthesis of scenes from multiple input views, 3D Gaussian splatting emerges as a viable alternative to existing radiance field approaches, delivering great visual quality and real-time rendering. While successful in static scenes, the present advancement of 3D Gaussian representation, however, faces challenges in dynamic scenes in terms of memory consumption and the need for numerous observations per time step, due to the onus of storing 3D Gaussian parameters per time step. In this study, we present an efficient 3D Gaussian representation tailored for dynamic scenes in which we define positions and rotations as functions of time while leaving other time-invariant properties of the static 3D Gaussian unchanged. Notably, our representation reduces memory usage, which is consistent regardless of the input sequence length. Additionally, it mitigates the risk of overfitting observed frames by accounting for temporal changes. The optimization of our Gaussian representation based on image and flow reconstruction results in a powerful framework for dynamic scene view synthesis in both monocular and multi-view cases. We obtain the highest rendering speed of $118$ frames per second (FPS) at a resolution of $1352 \\times 1014$ with a single GPU, showing the practical usability and effectiveness of our proposed method in dynamic scene rendering scenarios.

    "abstract": "Neural operators extend the capabilities of traditional neural networks by allowing them to handle mappings between function spaces for the purpose of solving partial differential equations (PDEs). One of the most notable methods is the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), which is inspired by Green's function method and approximate operator kernel directly in the frequency domain. In this work, we focus on predicting multiscale dynamic spaces, which is equivalent to solving multiscale PDEs. Multiscale PDEs are characterized by rapid coefficient changes and solution space oscillations, which are crucial for modeling atmospheric convection and ocean circulation. To solve this problem, models should have the ability to capture rapid changes and process them at various scales. However, the FNO only approximates kernels in the low-frequency domain, which is insufficient when solving multiscale PDEs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hierarchical neural operator that integrates improved Fourier layers with attention mechanisms, aiming to capture all details and handle them at various scales. These mechanisms complement each other in the frequency domain and encourage the model to solve multiscale problems. We perform experiments on dynamic spaces governed by forward and reverse problems of multiscale elliptic equations, Navier-Stokes equations and some other physical scenarios, and reach superior performance in existing PDE benchmarks, especially equations characterized by rapid coefficient variations.

    "abstract": "The latest generation of transformer-based vision models have proven to be superior to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models across several vision tasks, largely attributed to their remarkable prowess in relation modeling. Deformable vision transformers significantly reduce the quadratic complexity of modeling attention by using sparse attention structures, enabling them to be used in larger scale applications such as multi-view vision systems. Recent work demonstrated adversarial attacks against transformers; we show that these attacks do not transfer to deformable transformers due to their sparse attention structure. Specifically, attention in deformable transformers is modeled using pointers to the most relevant other tokens. In this work, we contribute for the first time adversarial attacks that manipulate the attention of deformable transformers, distracting them to focus on irrelevant parts of the image. We also develop new collaborative attacks where a source patch manipulates attention to point to a target patch that adversarially attacks the system. In our experiments, we find that only 1% patched area of the input field can lead to 0% AP. We also show that the attacks provide substantial versatility to support different attacker scenarios because of their ability to redirect attention under the attacker control. ",

However, the human's intent in turn depends on actions the robot takes, creating a chicken-or-egg problem. Prior methods ignore such inter-dependency and instead train marginal intent prediction models independent of robot actions. This is because training conditional models is hard given a lack of paired human-robot interaction datasets. Can we instead leverage large-scale human-human interaction data that is more easily accessible? Our key insight is to exploit a correspondence between human and robot actions that enables transfer learning from human-human to human-robot data. We propose a novel architecture, InteRACT, that pre-trains a conditional intent prediction model on large human-human datasets and fine-tunes on a small human-robot dataset. We evaluate on a set of real-world collaborative human-robot manipulation tasks and show that our conditional model improves over various marginal baselines. We also introduce new techniques to tele-operate a 7-DoF robot arm and collect a diverse range of human-robot collaborative manipulation data, which we open-source. ",

This study addresses the inherent challenges in this domain, notably the detection of small objects, managing densely packed elements, and accounting for diverse orientations.

Natural Adversarial Examples (NAEs), arising naturally from the environment and capable of deceiving classifiers, are instrumental in identifying vulnerabilities in trained models.

In this work, we propose to actively synthesize NAEs with the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion. Specifically, our method formulates a controlled optimization process, where we perturb the token embedding that corresponds to a specified class to synthesize NAEs. The generation is guided by the gradient of loss from the target classifier so that the created image closely mimics the ground-truth class yet fools the classifier. Named SD-NAE (Stable Diffusion for Natural Adversarial Examples), our innovative method is effective in producing valid and useful NAEs, which is demonstrated through a meticulously designed experiment. Our work thereby provides a valuable method for obtaining challenging evaluation data, which in turn can potentially advance the development of more robust deep learning models.

We conjectured that jumps and irregularities are embedded in stock data due to the pandemic shock, which brings forth irregular trends in the time series data.

This piece of information is helpful to investors as far as confidence risk and return boost are concerned. Generative adversarial networks of a time series nature are used to provide new ways of modeling and learning the proper and suitable distribution for the financial time series data under complex setups. Ideally, these traditional models are liable to producing high forecasting errors, and they need to be more robust to capture dependency structures and other stylized facts like volatility in stock markets. The TimeGAN model is used, effectively dealing with this risk of poor forecasts. Using the DAX stock index from January 2010 to November 2022, we trained the LSTM, GRU, WGAN, and TimeGAN models as benchmarks and forecasting errors were noted, and our TimeGAN outperformed them all as indicated by a small forecasting error.

To respond to this need, we developed a unified perception and navigation framework, which enables the robot to identify and follow a target person using a combination of visual Re-Identification (Re-ID), hand gestures detection, and collision-free navigation. The Re-ID module can autonomously learn the features of a target person and use the acquired knowledge to visually re-identify the target.

More recent methods have delved into N-shot techniques that utilize one or more audio samples to aid in the separation. However, a challenge with some of these methods is the necessity for an audio query during inference, making them less suited for genres with varied timbres and effects. This paper offers a proof-of-concept for a self-supervised music source separation system that eliminates the need for audio queries at inference time. In the training phase, while it adopts a query-based approach, we introduce a modification by substituting the continuous embedding of query audios with Vector Quantized (VQ) representations. Trained end-to-end with up to N classes as determined by the VQ's codebook size, the model seeks to effectively categorise instrument classes. During inference, the input is partitioned into N sources, with some potentially left unutilized based on the mix's instrument makeup.

    "abstract": "Many real-world decision processes are modeled by optimization problems whose defining parameters are unknown and must be inferred from observable data. The Predict-Then-Optimize framework uses machine learning models to predict unknown parameters of an optimization problem from features before solving. Recent works show that decision quality can be improved in this setting by solving and differentiating the optimization problem in the training loop, enabling end-to-end training with loss functions defined directly on the resulting decisions. However, this approach can be inefficient and requires handcrafted, problem-specific rules for backpropagation through the optimization step. This paper proposes an alternative method, in which optimal solutions are learned directly from the observable features by predictive models. The approach is generic, and based on an adaptation of the Learning-to-Optimize paradigm, from which a rich variety of existing techniques can be employed. Experimental evaluations show the ability of several Learning-to-Optimize methods to provide efficient, accurate, and flexible solutions to an array of challenging Predict-Then-Optimize problems. ",

    "abstract": "The open source of large amounts of image data promotes the development of deep learning techniques. Along with this comes the privacy risk of these open-source image datasets being exploited by unauthorized third parties to train deep learning models for commercial or illegal purposes. To avoid the abuse of public data, a poisoning-based technique, the unlearnable example, is proposed to significantly degrade the generalization performance of models by adding a kind of imperceptible noise to the data. To further enhance its robustness against adversarial training, existing works leverage iterative adversarial training on both the defensive noise and the surrogate model. However, it still remains unknown whether the robustness of unlearnable examples primarily comes from the effect of enhancement in the surrogate model or the defensive noise. Observing that simply removing the adversarial noise on the training process of the defensive noise can improve the performance of robust unlearnable examples, we identify that solely the surrogate model's robustness contributes to the performance. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation exists between the robustness of defensive noise and the protection performance, indicating defensive noise's instability issue. Motivated by this, to further boost the robust unlearnable example, we introduce stable error-minimizing noise (SEM), which trains the defensive noise against random perturbation instead of the time-consuming adversarial perturbation to improve the stability of defensive noise. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SEM achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet Subset in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

Using optimization methods like BFGS, L-BFGS, and TNC in an offline training phase, these parameters boost the accuracy of online DC power flow computations.

    "abstract": "Text-to-image diffusion models allow seamless generation of personalized images from scant reference photos. Yet, these tools, in the wrong hands, can fabricate misleading or harmful content, endangering individuals. To address this problem, existing poisoning-based approaches perturb user images in an imperceptible way to render them \"unlearnable\" from malicious uses. We identify two limitations of these defending approaches: i) sub-optimal due to the hand-crafted heuristics for solving the intractable bilevel optimization and ii) lack of robustness against simple data transformations like Gaussian filtering. To solve these challenges, we propose MetaCloak, which solves the bi-level poisoning problem with a meta-learning framework with an additional transformation sampling process to craft transferable and robust perturbation. Specifically, we employ a pool of surrogate diffusion models to craft transferable and model-agnostic perturbation. Furthermore, by incorporating an additional transformation process, we design a simple denoising-error maximization loss that is sufficient for causing transformation-robust semantic distortion and degradation in a personalized generation. Extensive experiments on the VGGFace2 and CelebA-HQ datasets show that MetaCloak outperforms existing approaches. Notably, MetaCloak can successfully fool online training services like Replicate, in a black-box manner, demonstrating the effectiveness of MetaCloak in real-world scenarios.

Conversely, point annotation, which treats objects as single points, offers a cost-effective alternative to rotated and horizontal bounding boxes but sacrifices performance due to the loss of size and orientation information. In this study, we introduce the P2RBox network, which leverages point annotations and a mask generator to create mask proposals, followed by filtration through our Inspector Module and Constrainer Module. This process selects high-quality masks, which are subsequently converted into rotated box annotations for training a fully supervised detector. Specifically, we've thoughtfully crafted an Inspector Module rooted in multi-instance learning principles to evaluate the semantic score of masks. We've also proposed a more robust mask quality assessment in conjunction with the Constrainer Module. Furthermore, we've introduced a Symmetry Axis Estimation (SAE) Module inspired by the spectral theorem for symmetric matrices to transform the top-performing mask proposal into rotated bounding boxes. P2RBox performs well with three fully supervised rotated object detectors: RetinaNet, Rotated FCOS, and Oriented R-CNN. By combining with Oriented R-CNN, P2RBox achieves 62.26% on DOTA-v1.0 test dataset. As far as we know, this is the first attempt at training an oriented object detector with point supervision. ",

However, restoring motion from blur is quite challenging due to the high ill-posedness of motion blur decomposition, intrinsic ambiguity in motion direction, and diverse motions in natural videos. In this work, by leveraging classical coded exposure imaging technique and emerging implicit neural representation for videos, we tactfully embed the motion direction cues into the blurry image during the imaging process and develop a novel self-recursive neural network to sequentially retrieve the latent video sequence from the blurry image utilizing the embedded motion direction cues.

We are inspired by the recent revolution of learning implicit representation and point cloud upsampling, which can produce high-quality 3D surface reconstruction and proximity-to-surface, respectively. Our idea is to leverage the implicit field reconstruction or point cloud upsampling techniques as a systematic way to augment point cloud data. Mainly, we test both strategies by sampling points from the reconstructed results and using the sampled point cloud as test-time augmented data. We show that both strategies are effective in improving accuracy. We observed that point cloud upsampling for test-time augmentation can lead to more significant performance improvement on downstream tasks such as object classification and segmentation on the ModelNet40, ShapeNet, ScanObjectNN, and SemanticKITTI datasets, especially for sparse point clouds.

While previous works focus on detecting communities alone, they do not consider the collective influences of users in these communities on other user nodes in social networks. Inspired by this, in this paper, we investigate the influence propagation from some \\textit{seed communities} and their influential effects that result in the \\textit{influenced communities}. We propose a novel problem, named \\textit{\\underline{Top-$L$} most \\underline{I}nfluential \\underline{C}ommunity \\underline{DE}tection} (Top$L$-ICDE) over social networks, which aims to retrieve top-$L$ seed communities with the highest influences, having high structural cohesiveness, and containing user-specified query keywords. In order to efficiently tackle the Top$L$-ICDE problem, we design effective pruning strategies to filter out false alarms of seed communities and propose an effective index mechanism to facilitate efficient Top-$L$ community retrieval. We develop an efficient Top$L$-ICDE answering algorithm by traversing the index and applying our proposed pruning strategies. We also formulate and tackle a variant of Top$L$-ICDE, named \\textit{diversified top-$L$ most influential community detection} (DTop$L$-ICDE), which returns a set of $L$ diversified communities with the highest diversity score (i.e., collaborative influences by $L$ communities). We prove that DTop$L$-ICDE is NP-hard, and propose an efficient greedy algorithm with our designed diversity score pruning. Through extensive experiments, we verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed Top$L$-ICDE and DTop$L$-ICDE approaches over real/synthetic social networks under various parameter settings.

Secondly, we present Ensembles of Modular SNNs, where multiple networks represent the same place, significantly enhancing accuracy compared to single-network models. Our SNNs are compact and small, comprising only 1500 neurons and 474k synapses, which makes them ideally suited for ensembling due to this small size. Lastly, we investigate the role of sequence matching in SNN-based VPR, a technique where consecutive images are used to refine place recognition. We analyze the responsiveness of SNNs to ensembling and sequence matching compared to other VPR techniques. Our contributions highlight the viability of SNNs for VPR, offering scalable and robust solutions, paving the way for their application in various energy-sensitive robotic tasks. ",

To address this problem, we propose Neural Incident Stokes Fields (NeISF), a multi-view inverse rendering framework that reduces ambiguities using polarization cues. The primary motivation for using polarization cues is that it is the accumulation of multi-bounced light, providing rich information about geometry and material. Based on this knowledge, the proposed incident Stokes field efficiently models the accumulated polarization effect with the aid of an original physically-based differentiable polarimetric renderer.

The effectiveness of these systems often depends on the complex interplay among the multiple domains. In this dynamic landscape, the problem of negative transfer arises, where heterogeneous knowledge between dissimilar domains leads to performance degradation due to differences in user preferences across these domains. As a remedy, we propose a new CDSR framework that addresses the problem of negative transfer by assessing the extent of negative transfer from one domain to another and adaptively assigning low weight values to the corresponding prediction losses. To this end, the amount of negative transfer is estimated by measuring the marginal contribution of each domain to model performance based on a cooperative game theory. In addition, a hierarchical contrastive learning approach that incorporates information from the sequence of coarse-level categories into that of fine-level categories (e.g., item level) when implementing contrastive learning was developed to mitigate negative transfer. Despite the potentially low relevance between domains at the fine-level, there may be higher relevance at the category level due to its generalised and broader preferences. We show that our model is superior to prior works in terms of model performance on two real-world datasets across ten different domains. ",

Existing frameworks utilize CPU-GPU heterogeneous environments to train GNN models and integrate mini-batch and sampling techniques to overcome the GPU memory limitation. In CPU-GPU heterogeneous environments, we can divide sample-based GNN training into three steps: sample, gather, and train. Existing GNN systems use different task orchestrating methods to employ each step on CPU or GPU. After extensive experiments and analysis, we find that existing task orchestrating methods fail to fully utilize the heterogeneous resources, limited by inefficient CPU processing or GPU resource contention. In this paper, we propose NeutronOrch, a system for sample-based GNN training that incorporates a layer-based task orchestrating method and ensures balanced utilization of the CPU and GPU. NeutronOrch decouples the training process by layer and pushes down the training task of the bottom layer to the CPU. This significantly reduces the computational load and memory footprint of GPU training. To avoid inefficient CPU processing, NeutronOrch only offloads the training of frequently accessed vertices to the CPU and lets GPU reuse their embeddings with bounded staleness. Furthermore, NeutronOrch provides a fine-grained pipeline design for the layer-based task orchestrating method, fully overlapping different tasks on heterogeneous resources while strictly guaranteeing bounded staleness. The experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art GNN systems, NeutronOrch can achieve up to 4.61x performance speedup. ",

To build our model, we first obtain features from the visual input and the postures of the robot's body via models prepared before the robot's operation. Then, we map their corresponding latent spaces by a sample-efficient robot's self-exploration at the mirror. In this way, the robot builds the solicited 3D pose detector, which quality is immediately perfect on the acquired samples instead of obtaining the quality gradually. The mapping, which employs associating the pairs of feature vectors, is then implemented in the same way as the key-value mechanism of the famous transformer models. Finally, deploying our model for imitation to a simulated robot allows us to study, tune up, and systematically evaluate its hyperparameters without the involvement of the human counterpart, advancing our previous research.

    "abstract": "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart, short for CAPTCHA, is an essential and relatively easy way to defend against malicious attacks implemented by bots. The security and usability trade-off limits the use of massive geometric transformations to interfere deep model recognition and deep models even outperformed humans in complex CAPTCHAs. The discovery of adversarial examples provides an ideal solution to the security and usability trade-off by integrating adversarial examples and CAPTCHAs to generate adversarial CAPTCHAs that can fool the deep models. In this paper, we extend the definition of adversarial CAPTCHAs and propose a classification method for adversarial CAPTCHAs. Then we systematically review some commonly used methods to generate adversarial examples and methods that are successfully used to generate adversarial CAPTCHAs. Also, we analyze some defense methods that can be used to defend adversarial CAPTCHAs, indicating potential threats to adversarial CAPTCHAs. Finally, we discuss some possible future research directions for adversarial CAPTCHAs at the end of this paper. ",

Most previous works have focused on attacking node classification networks under impractical white-box scenarios. In this work, we will propose a non-targeted Hard Label Black Box Node Injection Attack on Graph Neural Networks, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind. Under this setting, more real world tasks can be studied because our attack assumes no prior knowledge about (1): the model architecture of the GNN we are attacking; (2): the model's gradients; (3): the output logits of the target GNN model. Our attack is based on an existing edge perturbation attack, from which we restrict the optimization process to formulate a node injection attack. In the work, we will evaluate the performance of the attack using three datasets, COIL-DEL, IMDB-BINARY, and NCI1. ",

Besides years of learning, humans rely heavily on the richness of information from physical interaction with the environment. In particular, tactile sensing is crucial in providing such rich feedback. Despite its potential contributions to robotic manipulation, tactile sensing is less exploited; mainly due to the complexity of the time series provided by tactile sensors. In this work, we propose a method for assessing grasp stability using tactile sensing. More specifically, we propose a methodology to extract task-relevant features and design efficient classifiers to detect object slippage with respect to individual fingertips. We compare two classification models: support vector machine and logistic regression. We use highly sensitive Uskin tactile sensors mounted on an Allegro hand to test and validate our method. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in slippage detection in an online fashion. ",

In this work, we present ViStruct, a training framework to learn VLMs for effective visual structural knowledge extraction. Two novel designs are incorporated. First, we propose to leverage the inherent structure of programming language to depict visual structural information. This approach enables explicit and consistent representation of visual structural information of multiple granularities, such as concepts, relations, and events, in a well-organized structured format. Second, we introduce curriculum-based learning for VLMs to progressively comprehend visual structures, from fundamental visual concepts to intricate event structures. Our intuition is that lower-level knowledge may contribute to complex visual structure understanding. Furthermore, we compile and release a collection of datasets tailored for visual structural knowledge extraction. We adopt a weakly-supervised approach to directly generate visual event structures from captions for ViStruct training, capitalizing on abundant image-caption pairs from the web. In experiments, we evaluate ViStruct on visual structure prediction tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the understanding of visual structures.

These deep learning based methods heavily rely on synthetic training data, and the performance will degrade when facing new tasks. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-style copy-move forgery detection network named as CMFDFormer, and provide a novel PCSD (Pooled Cube and Strip Distillation) continual learning framework to help CMFDFormer handle new tasks. CMFDFormer consists of a MiT (Mix Transformer) backbone network and a PHD (Pluggable Hybrid Decoder) mask prediction network. The MiT backbone network is a Transformer-style network which is adopted on the basis of comprehensive analyses with CNN-style and MLP-style backbones. The PHD network is constructed based on self-correlation computation, hierarchical feature integration, a multi-scale cycle fully-connected block and a mask reconstruction block. The PHD network is applicable to feature extractors of different styles for hierarchical multi-scale information extraction, achieving comparable performance. Last but not least, we propose a PCSD continual learning framework to improve the forgery detectability and avoid catastrophic forgetting when handling new tasks. Our continual learning framework restricts intermediate features from the PHD network, and takes advantage of both cube pooling and strip pooling. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the good performance of CMFDFormer and the effectiveness of the PCSD continual learning framework. ",

These factors, which take up a large proportion of training time, make data management in GNN training more significant. This paper reviews GNN training from a data management perspective and provides a comprehensive analysis and evaluation of the representative approaches.

    "abstract": "Hydropower plants are crucial for stable renewable energy and serve as vital water sources for sustainable agriculture. However, it is essential to assess the current water management practices associated with hydropower plant management software. A key concern is the potential conflict between electricity generation and agricultural water needs. Prioritising water for electricity generation can reduce irrigation availability in agriculture during crucial periods like droughts, impacting crop yields and regional food security. Coordination between electricity and agricultural water allocation is necessary to ensure optimal and environmentally sound practices. Neural networks have become valuable tools for hydropower plant management, but their black-box nature raises concerns about transparency in decision making. Additionally, current approaches often do not take advantage of their potential to create a system that effectively balances water allocation. This work is a call for attention and highlights the potential risks of deploying neural network-based hydropower plant management software without proper scrutiny and control. To address these concerns, we propose the adoption of the Agriculture Conscious Hydropower Plant Management framework, aiming to maximise electricity production while prioritising stable irrigation for agriculture. We also advocate reevaluating government-imposed minimum water guidelines for irrigation to ensure flexibility and effective water allocation. Additionally, we suggest a set of regulatory measures to promote model transparency and robustness, certifying software that makes conscious and intelligent water allocation decisions, ultimately safeguarding agriculture from undue strain during droughts.

Previous works inherited the ideology of vision-to-language generation tasks,aiming to generate paragraphs with high consistency as reports. However, one unique characteristic of RRG, the independence between diseases, was neglected, leading to the injection of the spurious confounder, i.e., the disease co-occurrence. Unfortunately, this confounder confuses the process of report generation worse because of the biased RRG data distribution. In this paper, to rethink this issue thoroughly, we reason about its causes and effects from a novel perspective of statistics and causality, where the Joint Vision Coupling and the Conditional Sentence Coherence Coupling are two aspects prone to implicitly decrease the accuracy of reports. Then, a counterfactual augmentation strategy that contains the Counterfactual Sample Synthesis and the Counterfactual Report Reconstruction sub-methods is proposed to break these two aspects of spurious effects. Experimental results and further analyses on two widely used datasets justify our reasoning and proposed methods. ",

The governing equations which couple the effects in the rock mass and in the fractures are obtained using the discrete fracture-matrix approach. The fracture flow is driven by the cubic law, and the non-penetration contact conditions prevent fractures from closing. A stable finite element discretization is proposed for the displacement-pressure-flux formulation. The resulting nonlinear algebraic system of equations and inequalities is decoupled using a robust iterative splitting into the linearized flow subproblem, and the quadratic programming problem for the mechanical part. The non-penetration conditions are solved by means of the MPGP algorithm. The capability of the numerical scheme is demonstrated on a benchmark problem for borehole excavation with hundreds of fractures in 3D. The paper's novelty consists in combination of three crucial ingredients: (i) application of discrete fracture matrix approach, (ii) robust iterative splitting of resulting nonlinear algebraic system working for real-world 3D problems and (iii) efficient solution of its mechanical quadratic programming part with large number of fractures in mutual contact by means of own solvers with known rate of convergence implemented into in-house PERMON library.

In this work, we depart from this observation and reexamine the role of supervision in continual representation learning.

The reports are delivered over a block-fading channel to a common Access Point (AP) in slotted ALOHA fashion, which leverages the imbalances in the received powers among the contending users and applies successive interference cancellation (SIC) to decode user packets from the collisions. We provide an extensive analytical treatment of the setup, deriving the Age of Information (AoI), throughput and deadline violation probability, when the AP has access to both the perfect as well as the imperfect channel-state information. We show that adopting SIC improves all the performance parameters with respect to the standard slotted ALOHA, as well as to an age-dependent access method. The analytical results agree with the simulation based ones, demonstrating that investing in the SIC capability at the receiver enables this simple access method to support timely and efficient information delivery in IIoT networks.

Correctness means that the attacks displayed by the attack tree are indeed attacks in the system; clarity means that the tree is efficient in communicating the attack scenario. To pursue clarity, we introduce an attack-tree generation algorithm that minimises the tree size and the information length of its labels without sacrificing correctness. We achieve this by establishing a connection between the problem of factorising algebraic expressions and the problem of minimising the tree size. Notably, our generation algorithm can handle complex attacks that execute actions in parallel and sequentially. For completeness, we introduce a system model that integrates well with our generation approach, and validate the resulting framework via a running example. ",

These metrics reflect different concepts of timely delivery of sensor information. Monitoring traffic serves to maintain fresh status updates, expressed in a low AoI, which is important for proper control and actuation actions. On the other hand, safety-critical information, e.g., emergency alarms, is generated sporadically and must be delivered with high reliability within a predefined deadline. In this work, we investigate the AoI-reliability trade-off in a real-time monitoring scenario that supports two traffic flows, namely AoI-oriented traffic and deadline-oriented traffic. Both traffic flows are transmitted to a central controller over an unreliable shared channel. We derive expressions of the average AoI for the AoI-oriented traffic and reliability, represented by Packet Loss Probability (PLP), for the deadline-oriented traffic using Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC). We also conduct discrete-event simulations in MATLAB to validate the analytical results and evaluate the interaction between the two types of traffic flows. The results clearly demonstrate the tradeoff between the AoI and PLP in such heterogeneous IIoT networks and give insights on how to configure the network to achieve a target pair of AoI and PLP. ",

In the case of AI accelerators, side-channel information leakage opens up the threat scenario of extracting the internal secrets of pre-trained models. Therefore, sufficiently elaborate methods for design verification as well as fault and security evaluation at the electronic system level are in demand. In this paper, we propose estimating information leakage from the early design steps of AI accelerators to aid in a more robust architectural design. We first introduce the threat scenario before diving into SystemC as a standard method for early design evaluation and how this can be applied to threat modeling. We present two successful side-channel attack methods executed via SystemC-based power modeling: correlation power analysis and template attack, both leading to total information leakage. The presented models are verified against an industry-standard netlist-level power estimation to prove general feasibility and determine accuracy. Consequently, we explore the impact of additive noise in our simulation to establish indicators for early threat evaluation. The presented approach is again validated via a model-vs-netlist comparison, showing high accuracy of the achieved results. This work hence is a solid step towards fast attack deployment and, subsequently, the design of attack-resilient AI accelerators. ",

Although there have been prior studies of the relationship between hierarchy and voice, they tend to focus on more qualitative small-scale methods and do not account for structural aspects of the organisation. This paper develops large-scale computational techniques utilising temporal network analysis to measure the effect that organisational hierarchy has on communication patterns within an organisation, focusing on the structure of pairwise interactions between individuals. We focus on one major organisation as a case study - the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) - a major technical standards development organisation for the Internet. A particularly useful feature of the IETF is a transparent hierarchy, where participants take on explicit roles (e.g. Area Directors, Working Group Chairs). Its processes are also open, so we have visibility into the communication of people at different hierarchy levels over a long time period. We utilise a temporal network dataset of 989,911 email interactions among 23,741 participants to study how hierarchy impacts communication patterns. We show that the middle levels of the IETF are growing in terms of their dominance in communications. Higher levels consistently experience a higher proportion of incoming communication than lower levels, with higher levels initiating more communications too. We find that communication tends to flow \"up\" the hierarchy more than \"down\". Finally, we find that communication with higher-levels is associated with future communication more than for lower-levels, which we interpret as \"facilitation\". We conclude by discussing the implications this has on patterns within the wider IETF and for other organisations. ",

They improve upon previous neural network models of code, such as code2seq or seq2seq, that already demonstrated competitive results when performing tasks such as code summarization and identifying code vulnerabilities. However, these previous code models were shown vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e. small syntactic perturbations that do not change the program's semantics, such as the inclusion of \"dead code\" through false conditions or the addition of inconsequential print statements, designed to \"fool\" the models. LLMs can also be vulnerable to the same adversarial perturbations but a detailed study on this concern has been lacking so far. In this paper we aim to investigate the effect of adversarial perturbations on coding tasks with LLMs. In particular, we study the transferability of adversarial examples, generated through white-box attacks on smaller code models, to LLMs. Furthermore, to make the LLMs more robust against such adversaries without incurring the cost of retraining, we propose prompt-based defenses that involve modifying the prompt to include additional information such as examples of adversarially perturbed code and explicit instructions for reversing adversarial perturbations. Our experiments show that adversarial examples obtained with a smaller code model are indeed transferable, weakening the LLMs' performance. The proposed defenses show promise in improving the model's resilience, paving the way to more robust defensive solutions for LLMs in code-related applications. ",

    "abstract": "Curriculum learning provides a systematic approach to training. It refines training progressively, tailors training to task requirements, and improves generalization through exposure to diverse examples. We present a curriculum learning approach that builds on existing knowledge about text and graph complexity formalisms for training with text graph data. The core part of our approach is a novel data scheduler, which employs \"spaced repetition\" and complexity formalisms to guide the training process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on several text graph tasks and graph neural network architectures. The proposed model gains more and uses less data; consistently prefers text over graph complexity indices throughout training, while the best curricula derived from text and graph complexity indices are equally effective; and it learns transferable curricula across GNN models and datasets. In addition, we find that both node-level (local) and graph-level (global) graph complexity indices, as well as shallow and traditional text complexity indices play a crucial role in effective curriculum learning.

    "abstract": "Institutional bias can impact patient outcomes, educational attainment, and legal system navigation. Written records often reflect bias, and once bias is identified; it is possible to refer individuals for training to reduce bias. Many machine learning tools exist to explore text data and create predictive models that can search written records to identify real-time bias. However, few previous studies investigate large language model embeddings and geometric models of biased text data to understand geometry's impact on bias modeling accuracy. To overcome this issue, this study utilizes the RedditBias database to analyze textual biases. Four transformer models, including BERT and RoBERTa variants, were explored. Post-embedding, t-SNE allowed two-dimensional visualization of data. KNN classifiers differentiated bias types, with lower k-values proving more effective. Findings suggest BERT, particularly mini BERT, excels in bias classification, while multilingual models lag. The recommendation emphasizes refining monolingual models and exploring domain-specific biases. ",

Recent attention analysis studies provide initial interpretability insights by focusing solely on attention weights rather than considering the wider context modeling of Transformers. This study aims to shed some light on the previously ignored factors of the attention mechanism beyond the attention weights. We conduct an initial empirical study analyzing both attention distributions and transformed representations in CodeBERT. Across two programming languages, Java and Python, we find that the scaled transformation norms of the input better capture syntactic structure compared to attention weights alone. Our analysis reveals characterization of how CodeBERT embeds syntactic code properties. The findings demonstrate the importance of incorporating factors beyond just attention weights for rigorously understanding neural code models. This lays the groundwork for developing more interpretable models and effective uses of attention mechanisms in program analysis. ",

The proposed approach leverages vibration data collected during normal operation for training, overcoming challenges such as labeling issues and data imbalance often encountered in supervised learning methods. DCAN includes the modules of convolutional feature extraction and transposed convolutional feature reconstruction, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in signal processing and feature extraction.

Experimental results validate the DCAN model's reliability in recognizing fault vibration patterns.

    "abstract": "Linear principal component analysis (PCA), nonlinear PCA, and linear independent component analysis (ICA) -- those are three methods with single-layer autoencoder formulations for learning linear transformations from data. Linear PCA learns orthogonal transformations (rotations) that orient axes to maximise variance, but it suffers from a subspace rotational indeterminacy: it fails to find a unique rotation for axes that share the same variance. Both nonlinear PCA and linear ICA reduce the subspace indeterminacy from rotational to permutational by maximising statistical independence under the assumption of unit variance. The main difference between them is that nonlinear PCA only learns rotations while linear ICA learns not just rotations but any linear transformation with unit variance. The relationship between all three can be understood by the singular value decomposition of the linear ICA transformation into a sequence of rotation, scale, rotation. Linear PCA learns the first rotation; nonlinear PCA learns the second. The scale is simply the inverse of the standard deviations. The problem is that, in contrast to linear PCA, conventional nonlinear PCA cannot be used directly on the data to learn the first rotation, the first being special as it reduces dimensionality and orders by variances. In this paper, we have identified the cause, and as a solution we propose $\\sigma$-PCA: a unified neural model for linear and nonlinear PCA as single-layer autoencoders. One of its key ingredients: modelling not just the rotation but also the scale -- the variances. This model bridges the disparity between linear and nonlinear PCA. And so, like linear PCA, it can learn a semi-orthogonal transformation that reduces dimensionality and orders by variances, but, unlike linear PCA, it does not suffer from rotational indeterminacy.

Moreover, INVERT provides an interpretable metric assessing the alignment between the representation and its corresponding explanation and delivering a measure of statistical significance, emphasizing its utility and credibility. We demonstrate the applicability of INVERT in various scenarios, including the identification of representations affected by spurious correlations, and the interpretation of the hierarchical structure of decision-making within the models.

That is, DOS is not solely determined by the crystalline material but also by the energy levels, which has been neglected in previous works. In this paper, we propose to integrate heterogeneous information obtained from the crystalline materials and the energies via a multi-modal transformer, thereby modeling the complex relationships between the atoms in the crystalline materials and various energy levels for DOS prediction. Moreover, we propose to utilize prompts to guide the model to learn the crystal structural system-specific interactions between crystalline materials and energies. Extensive experiments on two types of DOS, i.e., Phonon DOS and Electron DOS, with various real-world scenarios demonstrate the superiority of DOSTransformer. ",

A primary goal of autoscaling is to stabilize resource utilization at a desirable level, thus reconciling the need for resource-saving with the satisfaction of Service Level Objectives (SLOs). Existing proactive autoscaling methods anticipate the future workload and scale the resources in advance, whereas the reliability may suffer from prediction deviations arising from the frequent fluctuations and noise of cloud workloads; reactive methods rely on real-time system feedback, while the hysteretic nature of reactive methods could cause violations of the rigorous SLOs. To this end, this paper presents OptScaler, a hybrid autoscaling framework that integrates the power of both proactive and reactive methods for regulating CPU utilization. Specifically, the proactive module of OptScaler consists of a sophisticated workload prediction model and an optimization model, where the former provides reliable inputs to the latter for making optimal scaling decisions. The reactive module provides a self-tuning estimator of CPU utilization to the optimization model. We embed Model Predictive Control (MPC) mechanism and robust optimization techniques into the optimization model to further enhance its reliability. Numerical results have demonstrated the superiority of both the workload prediction model and the hybrid framework of OptScaler in the scenario of online services compared to prevalent reactive, proactive, or hybrid autoscalers. OptScaler has been successfully deployed at Alipay, supporting the autoscaling of applets in the world-leading payment platform. ",

    "abstract": "Parallel imaging is a commonly used technique to accelerate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquisition. Mathematically, parallel MRI reconstruction can be formulated as an inverse problem relating the sparsely sampled k-space measurements to the desired MRI image. Despite the success of many existing reconstruction algorithms, it remains a challenge to reliably reconstruct a high-quality image from highly reduced k-space measurements. Recently, implicit neural representation has emerged as a powerful paradigm to exploit the internal information and the physics of partially acquired data to generate the desired object. In this study, we introduced IMJENSE, a scan-specific implicit neural representation-based method for improving parallel MRI reconstruction. Specifically, the underlying MRI image and coil sensitivities were modeled as continuous functions of spatial coordinates, parameterized by neural networks and polynomials, respectively. The weights in the networks and coefficients in the polynomials were simultaneously learned directly from sparsely acquired k-space measurements, without fully sampled ground truth data for training. Benefiting from the powerful continuous representation and joint estimation of the MRI image and coil sensitivities, IMJENSE outperforms conventional image or k-space domain reconstruction algorithms. With extremely limited calibration data, IMJENSE is more stable than supervised calibrationless and calibration-based deep-learning methods. Results show that IMJENSE robustly reconstructs the images acquired at 5$\\mathbf{\\times}$ and 6$\\mathbf{\\times}$ accelerations with only 4 or 8 calibration lines in 2D Cartesian acquisitions, corresponding to 22.0% and 19.5% undersampling rates. The high-quality results and scanning specificity make the proposed method hold the potential for further accelerating the data acquisition of parallel MRI. ",

Our work aims to enhance the operational efficiency of SDD by focusing on the ultra-fast Order Dispatching Problem (ODP), which involves matching and dispatching orders to couriers within a centralized warehouse setting, and completing the delivery within a strict timeline (e.g., within minutes). We introduce important extensions to ultra-fast ODP such as order batching and explicit courier assignments to provide a more realistic representation of dispatching operations and improve delivery efficiency. As a solution method, we primarily focus on NeurADP, a methodology that combines Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and our work constitutes the first application of NeurADP outside of the ride-pool matching problem. NeurADP is particularly suitable for ultra-fast ODP as it addresses complex one-to-many matching and routing intricacies through a neural network-based VFA that captures high-dimensional problem dynamics without requiring manual feature engineering as in generic ADP methods. We test our proposed approach using four distinct realistic datasets tailored for ODP and compare the performance of NeurADP against myopic and DRL baselines by also making use of non-trivial bounds to assess the quality of the policies. Our numerical results indicate that the inclusion of order batching and courier queues enhances the efficiency of delivery operations and that NeurADP significantly outperforms other methods. Detailed sensitivity analysis with important parameters confirms the robustness of NeurADP under different scenarios, including variations in courier numbers, spatial setup, vehicle capacity, and permitted delay time.

We find that mask-wearing-related government regulations and public-transport announcements encouraged correct mask-wearing-behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, changes in announcement and regulation contents led to heterogeneous effects on people's behaviour. Comparing the predictive power of regression analysis and neural networks, we demonstrate that the latter produces more accurate predictions of population reactions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our use of regression modelling also allows us to unearth possible causal pathways underlying societal behaviour. Since our findings highlight the importance of appropriate communication contents, our results will facilitate more effective non-pharmaceutical interventions to be developed in future.

To address these concerns, this paper proposes a single image, self-supervised (SS) CS-MRI framework that enables a joint deep and sparse regularisation of CS artefacts. The approach effectively dampens structured CS artefacts, which can be difficult to remove assuming sparse reconstruction, or relying solely on the inductive biases of CNN to produce noise-free images. Image quality is thereby improved compared to either approach alone. Metrics are evaluated using Cartesian 1D masks on a brain and knee dataset, with PSNR improving by 2-4dB on average. ",

    "title": "Spatial Audio and Individualized HRTFs using a Convolutional Neural  Network (CNN)",
    "abstract": "Spatial audio and 3-Dimensional sound rendering techniques play a pivotal and essential role in immersive audio experiences. Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) are acoustic filters which represent how sound interacts with an individual's unique head and ears anatomy. The use of HRTFs compliant to the subjects anatomical traits is crucial to ensure a personalized and unique spatial experience. This work proposes the implementation of an HRTF individualization method based on anthropometric features automatically extracted from ear images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Firstly, a CNN is implemented and tested to assess the performance of machine learning on positioning landmarks on ear images. The I-BUG dataset, containing ear images with corresponding 55 landmarks, was used to train and test the neural network. Subsequently, 12 relevant landmarks were selected to correspond to 7 specific anthropometric measurements established by the HUTUBS database. These landmarks serve as a reference for distance computation in pixels in order to retrieve the anthropometric measurements from the ear images. Once the 7 distances in pixels are extracted from the ear image, they are converted in centimetres using conversion factors, a best match method vector is implemented computing the Euclidean distance for each set in a database of 116 ears with their corresponding 7 anthropometric measurements provided by the HUTUBS database. The closest match of anthropometry can be identified and the corresponding set of HRTFs can be obtained for personnalized use. The method is evaluated in its validity instead of the accuracy of the results. The conceptual scope of each stage has been verified and substantiated to function correctly. The various steps and the available elements in the process are reviewed and challenged to define a greater algorithm entity designed for the desired task. ",

    "title": "Extracting individual variable information for their decoupling, direct  mutual information and multi-feature Granger causality",
    "abstract": "Working with multiple variables they usually contain difficult to control complex dependencies. This article proposes extraction of their individual information, e.g. $\\overline{X|Y}$ as random variable containing information from $X$, but with removed information about $Y$, by using $(x,y) \\leftrightarrow (\\bar{x}=\\textrm{CDF}_{X|Y=y}(x),y)$ reversible normalization. One application can be decoupling of individual information of variables: reversibly transform $(X_1,\\ldots,X_n)\\leftrightarrow(\\tilde{X}_1,\\ldots \\tilde{X}_n)$ together containing the same information, but being independent: $\\forall_{i\\neq j} \\tilde{X}_i\\perp \\tilde{X}_j, \\tilde{X}_i\\perp X_j$. It requires detailed models of complex conditional probability distributions - it is generally a difficult task, but here can be done through multiple dependency reducing iterations, using imperfect methods (here HCR: Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction). It could be also used for direct mutual information - evaluating direct information transfer: without use of intermediate variables. For causality direction there is discussed multi-feature Granger causality, e.g. to trace various types of individual information transfers between such decoupled variables, including propagation time (delay).

Leveraging the power of transfer learning, the initialization challenges and sparse data issues inherent in cyclic shear strain loads are addressed in the RNN models. A mean-field model generates a comprehensive data set representing elasto-plastic behavior. In simulations, arbitrary six-dimensional strain histories are used to predict stresses under random walking as the source task and cyclic loading conditions as the target task. Incorporating sub-scale properties enhances RNN versatility. In order to achieve accurate predictions, the model uses a grid search method to tune network architecture and hyper-parameter configurations. The results of this study demonstrate that transfer learning can be used to effectively adapt the RNN to varying strain conditions, which establishes its potential as a useful tool for modeling path-dependent responses in woven composites.

To address these issues, we harness the power of Graph Isomorphic Networks, Multi Headed Attention and Free Large-scale Adversarial Augmentation separately on Graphs for precisely capturing the structural data of molecules and their toxicological properties. Additionally, we incorporate Few-Shot Learning to improve the model's generalization with limited annotated samples. Extensive experiments on a diverse toxicology dataset demonstrate that our method achieves an impressive state-of-art AUC-ROC value of 0.816, surpassing the baseline GCN model by 11.4%. This highlights the significance of our proposed methodology and Few Shot Learning in advancing Toxic Molecular Classification, with the potential to enhance drug discovery and environmental risk assessment processes.

In this paper, we explore a method for solving the Grad-Shafranov equation by using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). For PINNs, we optimize neural networks by directly minimizing the residual of the PDE as a loss function. We show that PINNs can accurately and effectively solve the Grad-Shafranov equation with several different boundary conditions. We also explore the parameter space by varying the size of the model, the learning rate, and boundary conditions to map various trade-offs such as between reconstruction error and computational speed. Additionally, we introduce a parameterized PINN framework, expanding the input space to include variables such as pressure, aspect ratio, elongation, and triangularity in order to handle a broader range of plasma scenarios within a single network. Parametrized PINNs could be used in future work to solve inverse problems such as shape optimization. ",
