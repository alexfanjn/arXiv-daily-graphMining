    "title": "Adapting Fake News Detection to the Era of Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "In the age of large language models (LLMs) and the widespread adoption of AI-driven content creation, the landscape of information dissemination has witnessed a paradigm shift. With the proliferation of both human-written and machine-generated real and fake news, robustly and effectively discerning the veracity of news articles has become an intricate challenge. While substantial research has been dedicated to fake news detection, this either assumes that all news articles are human-written or abruptly assumes that all machine-generated news are fake. Thus, a significant gap exists in understanding the interplay between machine-(paraphrased) real news, machine-generated fake news, human-written fake news, and human-written real news. In this paper, we study this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of fake news detectors trained in various scenarios. Our primary objectives revolve around the following pivotal question: How to adapt fake news detectors to the era of LLMs? Our experiments reveal an interesting pattern that detectors trained exclusively on human-written articles can indeed perform well at detecting machine-generated fake news, but not vice versa. Moreover, due to the bias of detectors against machine-generated texts \\cite{su2023fake}, they should be trained on datasets with a lower machine-generated news ratio than the test set. Building on our findings, we provide a practical strategy for the development of robust fake news detectors. ",

    "abstract": "Predicting upcoming events is critical to our ability to interact with our environment. Transformer models, trained on next-word prediction, appear to construct representations of linguistic input that can support diverse downstream tasks. But how does a predictive objective shape such representations? Inspired by recent work in vision (Henaff et al., 2019), we test a hypothesis about predictive representations of autoregressive transformers. In particular, we test whether the neural trajectory of a sentence becomes progressively straighter as it passes through the network layers. The key insight is that straighter trajectories should facilitate prediction via linear extrapolation. We quantify straightness using a 1-dimensional curvature metric, and present four findings in support of the trajectory straightening hypothesis: i) In trained models, the curvature decreases from the early to the deeper layers of the network. ii) Models that perform better on the next-word prediction objective exhibit greater decreases in curvature, suggesting that this improved ability to straighten sentence trajectories may be the driver of better language modeling performance. iii) Given the same linguistic context, the sequences that are generated by the model have lower curvature than the actual continuations observed in a language corpus, suggesting that the model favors straighter trajectories for making predictions. iv) A consistent relationship holds between the average curvature and the average surprisal of sentences in the deep model layers, such that sentences with straighter trajectories also have lower surprisal. Importantly, untrained models do not exhibit these behaviors. In tandem, these results support the trajectory straightening hypothesis and provide a possible mechanism for how the geometry of the internal representations of autoregressive models supports next word prediction.

The pipeline's ability to solve the anomaly detection task was evaluated using different datasets created from a large Amazon database. Additionally, a study comparing three explainability techniques involving 241 participants was conducted to assess the explainability module. The study aimed to measure the impact of explanations on the respondents' ability to reproduce the classification model and their perceived usefulness. This work can be useful to automate tasks in review online platforms, such as those for electronic commerce, and offers inspiration for addressing similar problems in the field of anomaly detection in textual data. We also consider it interesting to have carried out a human evaluation of the capacity of different explainability techniques in a real and infrequent scenario such as the detection of anomalous reviews, as well as to reflect on whether it is possible to explain tasks as humanly subjective as this one.

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently shown remarkable generation ability, achieving state-of-the-art performance in many tasks. However, the high computational cost is still a troubling problem for diffusion models. To tackle this problem, we propose to automatically remove the structural redundancy in diffusion models with our proposed Diffusion Distillation-based Block-wise Neural Architecture Search (DiffNAS). Specifically, given a larger pretrained teacher, we leverage DiffNAS to search for the smallest architecture which achieves on-par or even better performance than the teacher. Considering current diffusion models are based on UNet which naturally has a block-wise structure, we perform neural architecture search independently in each block, which largely reduces the search space. Different from previous block-wise NAS methods, DiffNAS contains a block-wise local search strategy and a retraining strategy with a joint dynamic loss. Concretely, during the search process, we block-wisely select the best subnet to avoid the unfairness brought by the global search strategy used in previous works. When retraining the searched architecture, we adopt a dynamic joint loss to maintain the consistency between supernet training and subnet retraining, which also provides informative objectives for each block and shortens the paths of gradient propagation. We demonstrate this joint loss can effectively improve model performance. We also prove the necessity of the dynamic adjustment of this loss. The experiments show that our method can achieve significant computational reduction, especially on latent diffusion models with about 50% MACs and Parameter reduction. ",

Additionally, these systems enable access to 3D data via robotic tracking, enhancing volumetric reconstruction for improved ultrasound interpretation and precise disease diagnosis. However, the interpretability of 3D US reconstruction of abdominal images can be affected by the patient's breathing motion.

To this end, we provide the large, high-resolution dataset MAD comprising 105 labeled images with 14,667 annotated apple instances and 4,440 unlabeled images. Utilizing this dataset, we also propose a novel Semi-Supervised Small Apple Detection system S$^3$AD based on contextual attention and selective tiling to improve the challenging detection of small apples, while limiting the computational overhead. We conduct an extensive evaluation on MAD and the MSU dataset, showing that S$^3$AD substantially outperforms strong fully-supervised baselines, including several small object detection systems, by up to $14.9\\%$.

The Born machines support tractable log-likelihood, autoregressive and mask sampling, and have shown outstanding performance in various unsupervised learning tasks.

    "abstract": "Amid growing global mental health concerns, particularly among vulnerable groups, natural language processing offers a tremendous potential for early detection and intervention of people's mental disorders via analyzing their postings and discussions on social media platforms. However, ultra-sparse training data, often due to vast vocabularies and low-frequency words, hinders the analysis accuracy. Multi-labeling and Co-occurrences of symptoms may also blur the boundaries in distinguishing similar/co-related disorders. To address these issues, we propose a novel semantic feature preprocessing technique with a three-folded structure: 1) mitigating the feature sparsity with a weak classifier, 2) adaptive feature dimension with modulus loops, and 3) deep-mining and extending features among the contexts. With enhanced semantic features, we train a machine learning model to predict and classify mental disorders. We utilize the Reddit Mental Health Dataset 2022 to examine conditions such as Anxiety, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and Bipolar-Disorder (BD) and present solutions to the data sparsity challenge, highlighted by 99.81% non-zero elements. After applying our preprocessing technique, the feature sparsity decreases to 85.4%. Overall, our methods, when compared to seven benchmark models, demonstrate significant performance improvements: 8.0% in accuracy, 0.069 in precision, 0.093 in recall, 0.102 in F1 score, and 0.059 in AUC.

While quantization-aware training QAT is the well-studied approach to quantize the networks at low precision, most research focuses on over-parameterized networks for classification with limited studies on popular and edge device friendly single-shot object detection and semantic segmentation methods like YOLO. Moreover, majority of QAT methods rely on Straight-through Estimator (STE) approximation which suffers from an oscillation phenomenon resulting in sub-optimal network quantization. In this paper, we show that it is difficult to achieve extremely low precision (4-bit and lower) for efficient YOLO models even with SOTA QAT methods due to oscillation issue and existing methods to overcome this problem are not effective on these models. To mitigate the effect of oscillation, we first propose Exponentially Moving Average (EMA) based update to the QAT model. Further, we propose a simple QAT correction method, namely QC, that takes only a single epoch of training after standard QAT procedure to correct the error induced by oscillating weights and activations resulting in a more accurate quantized model. With extensive evaluation on COCO dataset using various YOLO5 and YOLO7 variants, we show that our correction method improves quantized YOLO networks consistently on both object detection and segmentation tasks at low-precision (4-bit and 3-bit).

We empirically demonstrate, for the first time, that ADAM optimization of HSCL and HUCL risks with random initialization and suitable hardness levels can indeed converge to the NC geometry if we incorporate unit-ball or unit-sphere feature normalization.

To establish such scoring systems, several \"empirical criteria\" are firstly determined, followed by dedicated top-down design for each factor of the score, which usually requires enormous effort to adjust and tune the scoring function in the new application scenario. What's worse, many fresh projects usually have no ground-truth or any experience to evaluate a reasonable scoring system, making the designing even harder. To reduce the effort of manual adjustment of the scoring function in every new scoring system, we innovatively study the scoring system from the preset empirical criteria without any ground truth, and propose a novel framework to improve the system from scratch. In this paper, we propose a \"counter-empirical attacking\" mechanism that can generate \"attacking\" behavior traces and try to break the empirical rules of the scoring system. Then an adversarial \"enhancer\" is applied to evaluate the scoring system and find the improvement strategy. By training the adversarial learning problem, a proper scoring function can be learned to be robust to the attacking activity traces that are trying to violate the empirical criteria. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two scoring systems including a shared computing resource platform and a financial credit system. The experimental results have validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework. ",

We simulate attacks where a number of generation nodes in a distribution grid are attacked. We show that the market is able to successfully meet the shortfall between demand and supply by utilizing the flexibility of remaining resources while minimizing any extra power that needs to be imported from the main transmission grid. This includes utilizing upward flexibility or reserves of remaining online generators and some curtailment or shifting of flexible loads, which results in higher costs. Using price signals and market-based coordination, the grid operator can achieve its objectives without direct control over distributed energy resources and is able to accurately compensate prosumers for the grid support they provide.

    "abstract": "Exploiting cognates for transfer learning in under-resourced languages is an exciting opportunity for language understanding tasks, including unsupervised machine translation, named entity recognition and information retrieval. Previous approaches mainly focused on supervised cognate detection tasks based on orthographic, phonetic or state-of-the-art contextual language models, which under-perform for most under-resourced languages. This paper proposes a novel language-agnostic weakly-supervised deep cognate detection framework for under-resourced languages using morphological knowledge from closely related languages. We train an encoder to gain morphological knowledge of a language and transfer the knowledge to perform unsupervised and weakly-supervised cognate detection tasks with and without the pivot language for the closely-related languages. While unsupervised, it overcomes the need for hand-crafted annotation of cognates. We performed experiments on different published cognate detection datasets across language families and observed not only significant improvement over the state-of-the-art but also our method outperformed the state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods. Our model can be extended to a wide range of languages from any language family as it overcomes the requirement of the annotation of the cognate pairs for training.

    "abstract": "As the IT industry advances, system log data becomes increasingly crucial. Many computer systems rely on log texts for management due to restricted access to source code. The need for log anomaly detection is growing, especially in real-world applications, but identifying anomalies in rapidly accumulating logs remains a challenging task. Traditional deep learning-based anomaly detection models require dataset-specific training, leading to corresponding delays. Notably, most methods only focus on sequence-level log information, which makes the detection of subtle anomalies harder, and often involve inference processes that are difficult to utilize in real-time. We introduce RAPID, a model that capitalizes on the inherent features of log data to enable anomaly detection without training delays, ensuring real-time capability. RAPID treats logs as natural language, extracting representations using pre-trained language models. Given that logs can be categorized based on system context, we implement a retrieval-based technique to contrast test logs with the most similar normal logs. This strategy not only obviates the need for log-specific training but also adeptly incorporates token-level information, ensuring refined and robust detection, particularly for unseen logs. We also propose the core set technique, which can reduce the computational cost needed for comparison. Experimental results show that even without training on log data, RAPID demonstrates competitive performance compared to prior models and achieves the best performance on certain datasets. Through various research questions, we verified its capability for real-time detection without delay. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning techniques have greatly enhanced the performance of fire detection in videos. However, video-based fire detection models heavily rely on labeled data, and the process of data labeling is particularly costly and time-consuming, especially when dealing with videos. Considering the limited quantity of labeled video data, we propose a semi-supervised fire detection model called FireMatch, which is based on consistency regularization and adversarial distribution alignment. Specifically, we first combine consistency regularization with pseudo-label. For unlabeled data, we design video data augmentation to obtain corresponding weakly augmented and strongly augmented samples. The proposed model predicts weakly augmented samples and retains pseudo-label above a threshold, while training on strongly augmented samples to predict these pseudo-labels for learning more robust feature representations. Secondly, we generate video cross-set augmented samples by adversarial distribution alignment to expand the training data and alleviate the decline in classification performance caused by insufficient labeled data. Finally, we introduce a fairness loss to help the model produce diverse predictions for input samples, thereby addressing the issue of high confidence with the non-fire class in fire classification scenarios. The FireMatch achieved an accuracy of 76.92% and 91.81% on two real-world fire datasets, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art semi-supervised classification methods. ",

To facilitate the training of large-scale SNNs, many training methods are borrowed from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), among which deep residual learning is the most commonly used. But the unique features of SNNs make prior intuition built upon ANNs not available for SNNs. Although there are a few studies that have made some pioneer attempts on the topology of Spiking ResNet, the advantages of different connections remain unclear. To tackle this issue, we analyze the merits and limitations of various residual connections and empirically demonstrate our ideas with extensive experiments. Then, based on our observations, we abstract the best-performing connections into densely additive (DA) connection, extend such a concept to other topologies, and propose four architectures for training large-scale SNNs, termed DANet, which brings up to 13.24% accuracy gain on ImageNet. Besides, in order to present a detailed methodology for designing the topology of large-scale SNNs, we further conduct in-depth discussions on their applicable scenarios in terms of their performance on various scales of datasets and demonstrate their advantages over prior architectures. At a low training expense, our best-performing ResNet-50/101/152 obtain 73.71%/76.13%/77.22% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 4 time steps. We believe that this work shall give more insights for future works to design the topology of their networks and promote the development of large-scale SNNs. The code will be publicly available. ",

We propose to decouple the two modalities by mixture of weak and strong experts (Mowst), where the weak expert is a light-weight Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and the strong expert is an off-the-shelf Graph Neural Network (GNN). To adapt the experts' collaboration to different target nodes, we propose a \"confidence\" mechanism based on the dispersion of the weak expert's prediction logits. The strong expert is conditionally activated when either the node's classification relies on neighborhood information, or the weak expert has low model quality. We reveal interesting training dynamics by analyzing the influence of the confidence function on loss: our training algorithm encourages the specialization of each expert by effectively generating soft splitting of the graph. In addition, our \"confidence\" design imposes a desirable bias toward the strong expert to benefit from GNN's better generalization capability. Mowst is easy to optimize and achieves strong expressive power, with a computation cost comparable to a single GNN. Empirically, Mowst shows significant accuracy improvement on 6 standard node classification benchmarks (including both homophilous and heterophilous graphs). ",

The integration of information from multi-view mammograms enhances radiologists' confidence and diminishes false-positive rates since they can examine on dual-view of the same breast to cross-reference the existence and location of the lesion. Inspired by this, we present TransReg, a Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) system designed to exploit the relationship between craniocaudal (CC), and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. The system includes cross-transformer to model the relationship between the region of interest (RoIs) extracted by siamese Faster RCNN network for mass detection problems. Our work is the first time cross-transformer has been integrated into an object detection framework to model the relation between ipsilateral views. Our experimental evaluation on DDSM and VinDr-Mammo datasets shows that our TransReg, equipped with SwinT as a feature extractor achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, at the false positive rate per image at 0.5, TransReg using SwinT gets a recall at 83.3% for DDSM dataset and 79.7% for VinDr-Mammo dataset. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive analysis to demonstrate that cross-transformer can function as an auto-registration module, aligning the masses in dual-view and utilizing this information to inform final predictions.

Despite being a major health concern, it often goes underdiagnosed leading to detrimental clinical outcomes. The increasing reliance on Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography for diagnosis presents challenges and a pressing need for enhanced diagnostic solutions. The primary objective of this study is to leverage deep learning techniques to enhance the Computer Assisted Diagnosis of PE. This study presents a comprehensive dual-pronged approach combining classification and detection for PE diagnosis. We introduce an Attention-Guided Convolutional Neural Network (AG-CNN) for classification, addressing both global and local lesion region. For detection, state-of-the-art models are employed to pinpoint potential PE regions. Different ensembling techniques further improve detection accuracy by combining predictions from different models. Finally, a heuristic strategy integrates classifier outputs with detection results, ensuring robust and accurate PE identification. Our attention-guided classification approach, tested on the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad's Pulmonary Embolism (FUMPE) dataset, outperformed the baseline model DenseNet-121 by achieving an 8.1% increase in the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic. By employing ensemble techniques with detection models, the mean average precision (mAP) was considerably enhanced by a 4.7% increase. The classifier-guided framework further refined the mAP and F1 scores over the ensemble models. Our research offers a comprehensive approach to PE diagnostics using deep learning, addressing the prevalent issues of underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis. We aim to improve PE patient care by integrating AI solutions into clinical workflows, highlighting the potential of human-AI collaboration in medical diagnostics. ",

Leveraging a conditional prompt and a fusion attention mechanism, this method significantly improves the accuracy and stability of brain network generation.

We validate applicability of this framework in the construction of brain network across healthy and neurologically impaired cohorts using the authentic dataset. Experimental results vividly demonstrate the significant effectiveness of the proposed method across the downstream disease classification tasks.

    "abstract": "In the reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, the ability to predict receiving reward in the near or more distant future means the ability to evaluate the current state as more or less close to the target state (labelled by the reward signal). In the present work, we utilize a spiking neural network (SNN) to predict time to the next target event (reward - in case of RL). In the context of SNNs, events are represented as spikes emitted by network neurons or input nodes. It is assumed that target events are indicated by spikes emitted by a special network input node. Using description of the current state encoded in the form of spikes from the other input nodes, the network should predict approximate time of the next target event. This research paper presents a novel approach to learning the corresponding predictive model by an SNN consisting of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. The proposed method leverages specially designed local synaptic plasticity rules and a novel columnar-layered SNN architecture. Similar to our previous works, this study places a strong emphasis on the hardware-friendliness of the proposed models, ensuring their efficient implementation on modern and future neuroprocessors. The approach proposed was tested on a simple reward prediction task in the context of one of the RL benchmark ATARI games, ping-pong. It was demonstrated that the SNN described in this paper gives superior prediction accuracy in comparison with precise machine learning techniques, such as decision tree algorithms and convolutional neural networks.

In this work, we aim to mitigate the bias by unveiling interactions between different variables to disentangle the non-confounding covariates when estimating causal effects from text. The disentangling process ensures covariates only contribute to their respective objectives, enabling independence between variables. Additionally, we impose a constraint to balance representations from the treatment group and control group to alleviate selection bias. We conduct experiments on two different treatment factors under various scenarios, and the proposed model significantly outperforms recent strong baselines.

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) involves sensors for monitoring and wireless networks for efficient communication. However, resource-constrained IoT devices and limitations in existing wireless technologies hinder its full potential. Integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) into IoT networks can address some challenges by expanding its' coverage, providing security, and bringing computing closer to IoT devices. Nevertheless, effective data collection in UAV-assisted IoT networks is hampered by factors, including dynamic UAV behavior, environmental variables, connectivity instability, and security considerations. In this survey, we first explore UAV-based IoT networks, focusing on communication and networking aspects. Next, we cover various UAV-based data collection methods their advantages and disadvantages, followed by a discussion on performance metrics for data collection. As this article primarily emphasizes reliable and efficient data collection in UAV-assisted IoT networks, we briefly discuss existing research on data accuracy and consistency, network connectivity, and data security and privacy to provide insights into reliable data collection. Additionally, we discuss efficient data collection strategies in UAV-based IoT networks, covering trajectory and path planning, collision avoidance, sensor network clustering, data aggregation, UAV swarm formations, and artificial intelligence for optimization. We also present two use cases of UAVs as a service for enhancing data collection reliability and efficiency. Finally, we discuss future challenges in data collection for UAV-assisted IoT networks. ",

    "abstract": "For explainable fault detection and classification (FDC), this paper proposes a unified framework, ABIGX (Adversarial fault reconstruction-Based Integrated Gradient eXplanation). ABIGX is derived from the essentials of previous successful fault diagnosis methods, contribution plots (CP) and reconstruction-based contribution (RBC). It is the first explanation framework that provides variable contributions for the general FDC models. The core part of ABIGX is the adversarial fault reconstruction (AFR) method, which rethinks the FR from the perspective of adversarial attack and generalizes to fault classification models with a new fault index. For fault classification, we put forward a new problem of fault class smearing, which intrinsically hinders the correct explanation. We prove that ABIGX effectively mitigates this problem and outperforms the existing gradient-based explanation methods. For fault detection, we theoretically bridge ABIGX with conventional fault diagnosis methods by proving that CP and RBC are the linear specifications of ABIGX. The experiments evaluate the explanations of FDC by quantitative metrics and intuitive illustrations, the results of which show the general superiority of ABIGX to other advanced explanation methods.

    "abstract": "In recent years, human pose estimation has made significant progress through the implementation of deep learning techniques. However, these techniques still face limitations when confronted with challenging scenarios, including occlusion, diverse appearances, variations in illumination, and overlap. To cope with such drawbacks, we present the Spatial Attention-based Distribution Integration Network (SADI-NET) to improve the accuracy of localization in such situations. Our network consists of three efficient models: the receptive fortified module (RFM), spatial fusion module (SFM), and distribution learning module (DLM). Building upon the classic HourglassNet architecture, we replace the basic block with our proposed RFM. The RFM incorporates a dilated residual block and attention mechanism to expand receptive fields while enhancing sensitivity to spatial information. In addition, the SFM incorporates multi-scale characteristics by employing both global and local attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the DLM, inspired by residual log-likelihood estimation (RLE), reconfigures a predicted heatmap using a trainable distribution weight. For the purpose of determining the efficacy of our model, we conducted extensive experiments on the MPII and LSP benchmarks. Particularly, our model obtained a remarkable $92.10\\%$ percent accuracy on the MPII test dataset, demonstrating significant improvements over existing models and establishing state-of-the-art performance.

Synthetic video-based datasets (e.g., SCAMPS~\\cite{mcduff2022scamps}) with photo-realistic synthesized avatars are introduced to alleviate the issues while providing high-quality synthetic data. However, there exists a significant gap between synthetic and real-world data, which hinders the generalization of neural models trained on these synthetic datasets. In this paper, we proposed several measures to add real-world noise to synthetic physiological signals and corresponding facial videos. We experimented with individual and combined augmentation methods and evaluated our framework on three public real-world datasets. Our results show that we were able to reduce the average MAE from 6.9 to 2.0. ",

    "abstract": "Blood vessel orientation as visualized in 3D medical images is an important descriptor of its geometry that can be used for centerline extraction and subsequent segmentation and visualization. Arteries appear at many scales and levels of tortuosity, and determining their exact orientation is challenging. Recent works have used 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for this purpose, but CNNs are sensitive to varying vessel sizes and orientations. We present SIRE: a scale-invariant, rotation-equivariant estimator for local vessel orientation. SIRE is modular and can generalise due to symmetry preservation. SIRE consists of a gauge equivariant mesh CNN (GEM-CNN) operating on multiple nested spherical meshes with different sizes in parallel. The features on each mesh are a projection of image intensities within the corresponding sphere. These features are intrinsic to the sphere and, in combination with the GEM-CNN, lead to SO(3)-equivariance. Approximate scale invariance is achieved by weight sharing and use of a symmetric maximum function to combine multi-scale predictions. Hence, SIRE can be trained with arbitrarily oriented vessels with varying radii to generalise to vessels with a wide range of calibres and tortuosity. We demonstrate the efficacy of SIRE using three datasets containing vessels of varying scales: the vascular model repository (VMR), the ASOCA coronary artery set, and a set of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). We embed SIRE in a centerline tracker which accurately tracks AAAs, regardless of the data SIRE is trained with. Moreover, SIRE can be used to track coronary arteries, even when trained only with AAAs. In conclusion, by incorporating SO(3) and scale symmetries, SIRE can determine the orientations of vessels outside of the training domain, forming a robust and data-efficient solution to geometric analysis of blood vessels in 3D medical images.

Furthermore, we classify existing approaches based on their applicability to particular privacy concerns occurring at a particular lifecycle stage. Finally, we propose a taxonomy of techniques used for privacy preservation in healthcare and triangulate those techniques with the lifecycle stages and concerns. Our review indicates heavy usage of cryptographical techniques in this domain. However, we have also found that healthcare systems have special requirements that require novel cryptographic techniques and security schemes to address special needs.

    "abstract": "Due to the frequent variability of object orientation, accurate prediction of orientation information remains a challenge in oriented object detection. To better extract orientation-related information, current methods primarily focus on the design of reasonable representations of oriented bounding box (OBB) and rotation-sensitive feature extraction. However, existing OBB representations often suffer from boundary discontinuity and representation ambiguity problems. Methods of designing continuous and unambiguous regression losses do not essentially solve such problems. Gaussian bounding box (GBB) avoids these OBB representation problems, but directly regressing GBB is susceptible to numerical instability. In this paper, we propose linear GBB (LGBB), a novel OBB representation. By linearly transforming the elements of GBB, LGBB does not have the boundary discontinuity and representation ambiguity problems, and have high numerical stability. On the other hand, current rotation-sensitive feature extraction methods based on convolutions can only extract features under a local receptive field, which is slow in aggregating rotation-sensitive features. To address this issue, we propose ring-shaped rotated convolution (RRC). By adaptively rotating feature maps to arbitrary orientations, RRC extracts rotation-sensitive features under a ring-shaped receptive field, rapidly aggregating rotation-sensitive features and contextual information. RRC can be applied to various models in a plug-and-play manner. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LGBB and RRC are effective and achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. By integrating LGBB and RRC into various models, the detection accuracy is effectively improved on DOTA and HRSC2016 datasets. ",

    "abstract": "The use of machine learning models in high-stake applications (e.g., healthcare, lending, college admission) has raised growing concerns due to potential biases against protected social groups. Various fairness notions and methods have been proposed to mitigate such biases. In this work, we focus on Counterfactual Fairness (CF), a fairness notion that is dependent on an underlying causal graph and first proposed by Kusner \\textit{et al.}~\\cite{kusner2017counterfactual}; it requires that the outcome an individual perceives is the same in the real world as it would be in a \"counterfactual\" world, in which the individual belongs to another social group. Learning fair models satisfying CF can be challenging. It was shown in \\cite{kusner2017counterfactual} that a sufficient condition for satisfying CF is to \\textbf{not} use features that are descendants of sensitive attributes in the causal graph. This implies a simple method that learns CF models only using non-descendants of sensitive attributes while eliminating all descendants. Although several subsequent works proposed methods that use all features for training CF models, there is no theoretical guarantee that they can satisfy CF. In contrast, this work proposes a new algorithm that trains models using all the available features. We theoretically and empirically show that models trained with this method can satisfy CF\\footnote{The code repository for this work can be found in \\url{https://github.com/osu-srml/CF_Representation_Learning}}.

Having access to an underlying causal graph comes with the promise of cause-effect estimation and the identification of efficient and safe interventions. However, learning causal representations remains a major challenge, due to the complexity of many real-world systems. Previous works on causal representation learning have mostly focused on Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE). These methods only provide representations from a point estimate, and they are unsuitable to handle high dimensions. To overcome these problems, we proposed a new Diffusion-based Causal Representation Learning (DCRL) algorithm. This algorithm uses diffusion-based representations for causal discovery. DCRL offers access to infinite dimensional latent codes, which encode different levels of information in the latent code. In a first proof of principle, we investigate the use of DCRL for causal representation learning. We further demonstrate experimentally that this approach performs comparably well in identifying the causal structure and causal variables. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, commonsense learning has been a hot topic in image-text matching. Although it can describe more graphic correlations, commonsense learning still has some shortcomings: 1) The existing methods are based on triplet semantic similarity measurement loss, which cannot effectively match the intractable negative in image-text sample pairs. 2) The weak generalization ability of the model leads to the poor effect of image and text matching on large-scale datasets. According to these shortcomings. This paper proposes a novel image-text matching model, called Active Mining Sample Pair Semantics image-text matching model (AMSPS). Compared with the single semantic learning mode of the commonsense learning model with triplet loss function, AMSPS is an active learning idea. Firstly, the proposed Adaptive Hierarchical Reinforcement Loss (AHRL) has diversified learning modes. Its active learning mode enables the model to more focus on the intractable negative samples to enhance the discriminating ability. In addition, AMSPS can also adaptively mine more hidden relevant semantic representations from uncommented items, which greatly improves the performance and generalization ability of the model. Experimental results on Flickr30K and MSCOCO universal datasets show that our proposed method is superior to advanced comparison methods. ",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have recently shown great success in text representation field. However, the high computational cost and high-dimensional representation of PLMs pose significant challenges for practical applications. To make models more accessible, an effective method is to distill large models into smaller representation models. In order to relieve the issue of performance degradation after distillation, we propose a novel Knowledge Distillation method called IBKD. This approach is motivated by the Information Bottleneck principle and aims to maximize the mutual information between the final representation of the teacher and student model, while simultaneously reducing the mutual information between the student model's representation and the input data. This enables the student model to preserve important learned information while avoiding unnecessary information, thus reducing the risk of over-fitting. Empirical studies on two main downstream applications of text representation (Semantic Textual Similarity and Dense Retrieval tasks) demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. ",

    "abstract": "Modern multi-centre randomized controlled trials (MCRCTs) collect massive amounts of tabular data, and are monitored intensively for irregularities by humans. We began by empirically evaluating 6 modern machine learning-based outlier detection algorithms on the task of identifying irregular data in 838 datasets from 7 real-world MCRCTs with a total of 77,001 patients from over 44 countries. Our results reinforce key findings from prior work in the outlier detection literature on data from other domains. Existing algorithms often succeed at identifying irregularities without any supervision, with at least one algorithm exhibiting positive performance 70.6% of the time. However, performance across datasets varies substantially with no single algorithm performing consistently well, motivating new techniques for unsupervised model selection or other means of aggregating potentially discordant predictions from multiple candidate models. We propose the Meta-learned Probabilistic Ensemble (MePE), a simple algorithm for aggregating the predictions of multiple unsupervised models, and show that it performs favourably compared to recent meta-learning approaches for outlier detection model selection. While meta-learning shows promise, small ensembles outperform all forms of meta-learning on average, a negative result that may guide the application of current outlier detection approaches in healthcare and other real-world domains.

    "abstract": "Virtual networks are an innovative abstraction that extends cloud computing concepts to the network: by supporting bandwidth reservations between compute nodes (e.g., virtual machines), virtual networks can provide a predictable performance to distributed and communication-intensive cloud applications. However, in order to make the most efficient use of the shared resources, the Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) problem has to be solved: a virtual network should be mapped onto the given physical network so that resource reservations are minimized. The problem has been studied intensively already and is known to be NP-hard in general. In this paper, we revisit this problem and consider it on specific topologies, as they often arise in practice. To be more precise, we study the weighted version of the VNE problem: we consider a virtual weighted network of a specific topology which we want to embed onto a weighted network with capacities and specific topology. As for topologies, we consider most fundamental and commonly used ones: line, star, $2$-tiered star, oversubscribed $2$-tiered star, and tree, in addition to also considering arbitrary topologies. We show that typically the VNE problem is NP-hard even in more specialized cases, however, sometimes there exists a polynomial algorithm: for example, an embedding of the oversubscribed $2$-tiered star onto the tree is polynomial while an embedding of an arbitrary $2$-tiered star is not.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been significant growth in the commercial applications of generative models, licensed and distributed by model developers to users, who in turn use them to offer services. In this scenario, there is a need to track and identify the responsible user in the presence of a violation of the license agreement or any kind of malicious usage. Although there are methods enabling Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to include invisible watermarks in the images they produce, generating a model with a different watermark, referred to as a fingerprint, for each user is time- and resource-consuming due to the need to retrain the model to include the desired fingerprint. In this paper, we propose a retraining-free GAN fingerprinting method that allows model developers to easily generate model copies with the same functionality but different fingerprints. The generator is modified by inserting additional Personalized Normalization (PN) layers whose parameters (scaling and bias) are generated by two dedicated shallow networks (ParamGen Nets) taking the fingerprint as input. A watermark decoder is trained simultaneously to extract the fingerprint from the generated images. The proposed method can embed different fingerprints inside the GAN by just changing the input of the ParamGen Nets and performing a feedforward pass, without finetuning or retraining. The performance of the proposed method in terms of robustness against both model-level and image-level attacks is also superior to the state-of-the-art. ",

    "abstract": "Image Schemas are repetitive cognitive patterns that influence the way we conceptualize and reason about various concepts present in speech. These patterns are deeply embedded within our cognitive processes and are reflected in our bodily expressions including gestures. Particularly, metaphoric gestures possess essential characteristics and semantic meanings that align with Image Schemas, to visually represent abstract concepts. The shape and form of gestures can convey abstract concepts, such as extending the forearm and hand or tracing a line with hand movements to visually represent the image schema of PATH. Previous behavior generation models have primarily focused on utilizing speech (acoustic features and text) to drive the generation model of virtual agents. They have not considered key semantic information as those carried by Image Schemas to effectively generate metaphoric gestures. To address this limitation, we introduce META4, a deep learning approach that generates metaphoric gestures from both speech and Image Schemas. Our approach has two primary goals: computing Image Schemas from input text to capture the underlying semantic and metaphorical meaning, and generating metaphoric gestures driven by speech and the computed image schemas. Our approach is the first method for generating speech driven metaphoric gestures while leveraging the potential of Image Schemas. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight the importance of both speech and image schemas in modeling metaphoric gestures. ",

One task where these benefits can be crucial is real-time object detection. However, RGB detectors still outperform event-based detectors due to the sparsity of the event data and missing visual details. In this paper, we develop a novel knowledge distillation approach to shrink the performance gap between these two modalities. To this end, we propose a cross-modality object detection distillation method that by design can focus on regions where the knowledge distillation works best. We achieve this by using an object-centric slot attention mechanism that can iteratively decouple features maps into object-centric features and corresponding pixel-features used for distillation. We evaluate our novel distillation approach on a synthetic and a real event dataset with aligned grayscale images as a teacher modality. We show that object-centric distillation allows to significantly improve the performance of the event-based student object detector, nearly halving the performance gap with respect to the teacher. ",

    "abstract": "As broadband Internet speeds continue to increase, the home wireless (\"WiFi\") network may more frequently become a performance bottleneck. Past research, now nearly a decade old, initially documented this phenomenon through indirect inference techniques, noting the prevalence of WiFi bottlenecks but never directly measuring them. In the intervening years, access network (and WiFi) speeds have increased, warranting a re-appraisal of this important question, particularly with renewed private and federal investment in access network infrastructure. This paper studies this question, developing a new system and measurement technique to perform direct measurements of WiFi and access network performance, ultimately collecting and analyzing a first-of-its-kind dataset of more than 13,000 joint measurements of WiFi and access network throughputs, in a real-world deployment spanning more than 50 homes, for nearly two years. Using this dataset, we re-examine the question of whether, when, and to what extent a user's home wireless network may be a performance bottleneck, particularly relative to their access connection. We do so by directly and continuously measuring the user's Internet performance along two separate components of the Internet path -- from a wireless client inside the home network to the wired point of access (e.g., the cable modem), and from the wired point of access to the user's ISP. Confirming and revising results from more than a decade ago, we find that a user's home wireless network is often the throughput bottleneck. In particular, for users with access links that exceed 800~Mbps, the user's home wireless network was the performance bottleneck 100% of the time. ",

Although existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods achieve high-fidelity results, the computational expense limits their use in real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we introduce BakedAvatar, a novel representation for real-time neural head avatar synthesis, deployable in a standard polygon rasterization pipeline. Our approach extracts deformable multi-layer meshes from learned isosurfaces of the head and computes expression-, pose-, and view-dependent appearances that can be baked into static textures for efficient rasterization. We thus propose a three-stage pipeline for neural head avatar synthesis, which includes learning continuous deformation, manifold, and radiance fields, extracting layered meshes and textures, and fine-tuning texture details with differential rasterization. Experimental results demonstrate that our representation generates synthesis results of comparable quality to other state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing the inference time required. We further showcase various head avatar synthesis results from monocular videos, including view synthesis, face reenactment, expression editing, and pose editing, all at interactive frame rates. ",

    "abstract": "Mixup refers to interpolation-based data augmentation, originally motivated as a way to go beyond empirical risk minimization (ERM). Its extensions mostly focus on the definition of interpolation and the space (input or feature) where it takes place, while the augmentation process itself is less studied. In most methods, the number of generated examples is limited to the mini-batch size and the number of examples being interpolated is limited to two (pairs), in the input space. We make progress in this direction by introducing MultiMix, which generates an arbitrarily large number of interpolated examples beyond the mini-batch size and interpolates the entire mini-batch in the embedding space. Effectively, we sample on the entire convex hull of the mini-batch rather than along linear segments between pairs of examples. On sequence data, we further extend to Dense MultiMix. We densely interpolate features and target labels at each spatial location and also apply the loss densely. To mitigate the lack of dense labels, we inherit labels from examples and weight interpolation factors by attention as a measure of confidence. Overall, we increase the number of loss terms per mini-batch by orders of magnitude at little additional cost. This is only possible because of interpolating in the embedding space. We empirically show that our solutions yield significant improvement over state-of-the-art mixup methods on four different benchmarks, despite interpolation being only linear. By analyzing the embedding space, we show that the classes are more tightly clustered and uniformly spread over the embedding space, thereby explaining the improved behavior. ",

The effectiveness of GANs often depends on the quality of feature extraction, a critical aspect of their architecture. This paper introduces L-WaveBlock, a novel and robust feature extractor that leverages the capabilities of the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with deep learning methodologies. L-WaveBlock is catered to quicken the convergence of GAN generators while simultaneously enhancing their performance. The paper demonstrates the remarkable utility of L-WaveBlock across three datasets, a road satellite imagery dataset, the CelebA dataset and the GoPro dataset, showcasing its ability to ease feature extraction and make it more efficient. By utilizing DWT, L-WaveBlock efficiently captures the intricate details of both structural and textural details, and further partitions feature maps into orthogonal subbands across multiple scales while preserving essential information at the same time. Not only does it lead to faster convergence, but also gives competent results on every dataset by employing the L-WaveBlock. The proposed method achieves an Inception Score of 3.6959 and a Structural Similarity Index of 0.4261 on the maps dataset, a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio of 29.05 and a Structural Similarity Index of 0.874 on the CelebA dataset. The proposed method performs competently to the state-of-the-art for the image denoising dataset, albeit not better, but still leads to faster convergence than conventional methods. With this, L-WaveBlock emerges as a robust and efficient tool for enhancing GAN-based image generation, demonstrating superior convergence speed and competitive performance across multiple datasets for image resolution, image generation and image denoising.

    "abstract": "Software Defined Networking has afforded numerous benefits to the network users but there are certain persisting issues with this technology, two of which are scalability and privacy. The natural solution to overcoming these limitations is a distributed SDN controller architecture where multiple controllers are deployed over the network, with each controller orchestrating a certain segment of the network. However, since the centralized control is the key attribute of SDN that allows it to be so beneficial, a centralized logical view of the network will have to be maintained by each of these controllers; this can be done through synchronization of the distributed controllers, where each controller communicates with the others to ensure that they remain informed about the entire network. There is however a network cost associated with constantly having to update each others about different aspects of the network, which will become a greater issue in dynamic wireless networks. To minimize this network cost, there is a need to consider not only when to get the update information from the neighboring controllers, but also where to dynamically place the controllers such that the network costs may be minimized. The placement should take into consideration both communication for synchronization among the distributed controllers and communication of the controllers with the network devices that they manage. In this work, we show that our multi-objective deep reinforcement learning-based method performs the best at achieving different application goals by developing policy for controller synchronization as well as placement, outperforming different other possible approaches, under a wide variety of network conditions.

Here, we study the connections between the trainability and expressibility of quantum tangent kernel models. In particular, for global loss functions, we rigorously prove that high expressibility of both the global and local quantum encodings can lead to exponential concentration of quantum tangent kernel values to zero. Whereas for local loss functions, such issue of exponential concentration persists owing to the high expressibility, but can be partially mitigated.

T-PDG uses data from prior runs of trajectory optimization algorithms to train a transformer neural network, which accurately predicts the relationship between problem parameters and the globally optimal solution for the powered descent guidance problem. The solution is encoded as the set of tight constraints corresponding to the constrained minimum-cost trajectory and the optimal final time of landing. By leveraging the attention mechanism of transformer neural networks, large sequences of time series data can be accurately predicted when given only the spacecraft state and landing site parameters. When applied to the real problem of Mars powered descent guidance, T-PDG reduces the time for computing the 3 degree of freedom fuel-optimal trajectory, when compared to lossless convexification, from an order of 1-8 seconds to less than 500 milliseconds. A safe and optimal solution is guaranteed by including a feasibility check in T-PDG before returning the final trajectory. ",

    "abstract": "Whispering is a distinct form of speech known for its soft, breathy, and hushed characteristics, often used for private communication. The acoustic characteristics of whispered speech differ substantially from normally phonated speech and the scarcity of adequate training data leads to low automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. To address the data scarcity issue, we use a signal processing-based technique that transforms the spectral characteristics of normal speech to those of pseudo-whispered speech. We augment an End-to-End ASR with pseudo-whispered speech and achieve an 18.2% relative reduction in word error rate for whispered speech compared to the baseline. Results for the individual speaker groups in the wTIMIT database show the best results for US English. Further investigation showed that the lack of glottal information in whispered speech has the largest impact on whispered speech ASR performance. ",

    "title": "Data Distillation for Neural Network Potentials toward Foundational  Dataset",
    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) techniques and atomistic modeling have rapidly transformed materials design and discovery. Specifically, generative models can swiftly propose promising materials for targeted applications. However, the predicted properties of materials through the generative models often do not match with calculated properties through ab initio calculations. This discrepancy can arise because the generated coordinates are not fully relaxed, whereas the many properties are derived from relaxed structures. Neural network-based potentials (NNPs) can expedite the process by providing relaxed structures from the initially generated ones. Nevertheless, acquiring data to train NNPs for this purpose can be extremely challenging as it needs to encompass previously unknown structures. This study utilized extended ensemble molecular dynamics (MD) to secure a broad range of liquid- and solid-phase configurations in one of the metallic systems, nickel. Then, we could significantly reduce them through active learning without losing much accuracy. We found that the NNP trained from the distilled data could predict different energy-minimized closed-pack crystal structures even though those structures were not explicitly part of the initial data. Furthermore, the data can be translated to other metallic systems (aluminum and niobium), without repeating the sampling and distillation processes. Our approach to data acquisition and distillation has demonstrated the potential to expedite NNP development and enhance materials design and discovery by integrating generative models. ",

    "abstract": "The semi-random graph process is an adaptive random graph process in which an online algorithm is initially presented an empty graph on $n$ vertices. In each round, a vertex $u$ is presented to the algorithm independently and uniformly at random. The algorithm then adaptively selects a vertex $v$, and adds the edge $uv$ to the graph. For a given graph property, the objective of the algorithm is to force the graph to satisfy this property asymptotically almost surely in as few rounds as possible. We focus on the property of Hamiltonicity. We present an adaptive strategy which creates a Hamiltonian cycle in $\\alpha n$ rounds, where $\\alpha < 1.81696$ is derived from the solution to a system of differential equations. We also show that achieving Hamiltonicity requires at least $\\beta n$ rounds, where $\\beta > 1.26575$. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning is becoming increasingly more important in times of autonomous driving and other smart industrial applications. Simultaneously a promising new approach to Reinforcement Learning arises using the inherent properties of quantum mechanics, reducing the trainable parameters of a model significantly. However, gradient-based Multi-Agent Quantum Reinforcement Learning methods often have to struggle with barren plateaus, holding them back from matching the performance of classical approaches. We build upon a existing approach for gradient free Quantum Reinforcement Learning and propose tree approaches with Variational Quantum Circuits for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning using evolutionary optimization. We evaluate our approach in the Coin Game environment and compare them to classical approaches. We showed that our Variational Quantum Circuit approaches perform significantly better compared to a neural network with a similar amount of trainable parameters. Compared to the larger neural network, our approaches archive similar results using $97.88\\%$ less parameters. ",
