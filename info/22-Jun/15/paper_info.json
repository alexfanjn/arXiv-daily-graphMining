    "title": "Does a Technique for Building Multimodal Representation Matter? --  Comparative Analysis",
    "abstract": "Creating a meaningful representation by fusing single modalities (e.g., text, images, or audio) is the core concept of multimodal learning. Although several techniques for building multimodal representations have been proven successful, they have not been compared yet. Therefore it has been ambiguous which technique can be expected to yield the best results in a given scenario and what factors should be considered while choosing such a technique. This paper explores the most common techniques for building multimodal data representations -- the late fusion, the early fusion, and the sketch, and compares them in classification tasks. Experiments are conducted on three datasets: Amazon Reviews, MovieLens25M, and MovieLens1M datasets. In general, our results confirm that multimodal representations are able to boost the performance of unimodal models from 0.919 to 0.969 of accuracy on Amazon Reviews and 0.907 to 0.918 of AUC on MovieLens25M. However, experiments on both MovieLens datasets indicate the importance of the meaningful input data to the given task. In this article, we show that the choice of the technique for building multimodal representation is crucial to obtain the highest possible model's performance, that comes with the proper modalities combination. Such choice relies on: the influence that each modality has on the analyzed machine learning (ML) problem; the type of the ML task; the memory constraints while training and predicting phase. ",

    "abstract": "One of the key challenges for the success of the energy transition towards renewable energies is the analysis of the dynamic stability of power grids. However, dynamic solutions are intractable and exceedingly expensive for large grids. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a promising method to reduce the computational effort of predicting dynamic stability of power grids, however datasets of appropriate complexity and size do not yet exist. We introduce two new datasets of synthetically generated power grids. For each grid, the dynamic stability has been estimated using Monte-Carlo simulations. The datasets have 10 times more grids than previously published. To evaluate the potential for real-world applications, we demonstrate the successful prediction on a Texan power grid model. The performance can be improved to surprisingly high levels by training more complex models on more data. Furthermore, the investigated grids have different sizes, enabling the application of out-of-distribution evaluation and transfer learning from a small to a large domain. We invite the community to improve our benchmark models and thus aid the energy transition with better tools. ",

It aims to provide CSS scholars, as well as policymakers and other stakeholders who apply CSS methods, with the critical and constructive means needed to ensure that their practices are ethical, trustworthy, and responsible. It begins by providing a taxonomy of the ethical challenges faced by researchers in the field of CSS. These are challenges related to (1) the treatment of research subjects, (2) the impacts of CSS research on affected individuals and communities, (3) the quality of CSS research and to its epistemological status, (4) research integrity, and (5) research equity. Taking these challenges as a motivation for cultural transformation, it then argues for the end-to-end incorporation of habits of responsible research and innovation (RRI) into CSS practices, focusing on the role that contextual considerations, anticipatory reflection, impact assessment, public engagement, and justifiable and well-documented action should play across the research lifecycle. In proposing the inclusion of habits of RRI in CSS practices, the chapter lays out several practical steps needed for ethical, trustworthy, and responsible CSS research activities. These include stakeholder engagement processes, research impact assessments, data lifecycle documentation, bias self-assessments, and transparent research reporting protocols. ",

    "abstract": "Observational studies of causal effects require adjustment for confounding factors. In the tabular setting, where these factors are well-defined, separate random variables, the effect of confounding is well understood. However, in public policy, ecology, and in medicine, decisions are often made in non-tabular settings, informed by patterns or objects detected in images (e.g., maps, satellite or tomography imagery). Using such imagery for causal inference presents an opportunity because objects in the image may be related to the treatment and outcome of interest. In these cases, we rely on the images to adjust for confounding but observed data do not directly label the existence of the important objects. Motivated by real-world applications, we formalize this challenge, how it can be handled, and what conditions are sufficient to identify and estimate causal effects. We analyze finite-sample performance using simulation experiments, estimating effects using a propensity adjustment algorithm that employs a machine learning model to estimate the image confounding. Our experiments also examine sensitivity to misspecification of the image pattern mechanism. Finally, we use our methodology to estimate the effects of policy interventions on poverty in African communities from satellite imagery. ",

However, existing MLP models are not good at capturing local details and lack prior knowledge of human configurations, which limits their modeling power for skeletal representation learning. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective graph-reinforced MLP-Like architecture, named GraphMLP, that combines MLPs and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in a global-local-graphical unified architecture for 3D human pose estimation. GraphMLP incorporates the graph structure of human bodies into an MLP model to meet the domain-specific demand while also allowing for both local and global spatial interactions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed GraphMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, i.e., Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.

Deep learning has revolutionised computer vision but has had limited application to radio perception tasks, in part due to lack of systematic datasets and benchmarks dedicated to the study of the performance and promise of radio sensing. To address this gap, we present MaxRay: a synthetic radio-visual dataset and benchmark that facilitate precise target localisation in radio. We further propose to learn to localise targets in radio without supervision by extracting self-coordinates from radio-visual correspondence. We use such self-supervised coordinates to train a radio localiser network. We characterise our performance against a number of state-of-the-art baselines. Our results indicate that accurate radio target localisation can be automatically learned from paired radio-visual data without labels, which is highly relevant to empirical data. This opens the door for vast data scalability and may prove key to realising the promise of robust radio sensing atop a unified perception-communication cellular infrastructure.

WebGPU is such a SaaS system that it holds the GPU-equipped server to execute students' CUDA code and releases the RESTful front-end website for students to write their code on. However, programming on an HTML-based interface is not satisfactory due to a lack of syntax highlighting and automatic keyword complement. On the other side, Visual Studio Code is now becoming the most popular programming interface due to its strong community and eclectic functionalities. Thus, we propose such a system that, students write code locally using VS Code with its coding-auxiliary extensions, and push the code to WebGPU with only one button pressed using our VSC-WebGPU extension. The extension is divided into 4 parts: the login process for automatically logging the student into WebGPU, the pull process that pulls the code down to the local workspace, the push process that copies the code to the browser for compiling and running, and the exit process to exit the browser and close the connection. This 4-step architecture is also applicable for any other automated tools to push local code to authorization-required SaaS systems using Web automata. ",

    "abstract": "A multitude of studies have been conducted on graph drawing, but many existing methods only focus on optimizing particular aesthetic aspects of graph layout. Given a graph, generating a good layout that satisfies certain human aesthetic preference remains a challenging task, especially if such preference can not be expressed as a differentiable objective function. In this paper, we propose a student-teacher GAN-based graph drawing framework, SmartGD, which learns to draw graphs just like how humans learn to perform tasks. The student network in the SmartGD learns graph drawing by imitating good layout examples, while the teacher network in SmartGD is responsible for providing ratings regarding the goodness of the generated layouts. When there is a lack of concrete aesthetic criteria to specify what constitutes a good layout, the student network can learn from the good layout examples. On the other hand, when the goodness of a layout can be assessed by quantitative criteria (even if not differentiable), the student network can use it as a concrete goal to optimize the target aesthetics. To accomplish the goal, we propose a novel variant of GAN, self-challenging GAN, to learn the optimal layout distribution with respect to any aesthetic criterion, whether the criterion is differentiable or not. The proposed graph drawing framework can not only draw graphs in a similar style as the good layout examples but also optimize the graph layouts according to any given aesthetic criteria when available. Once the model is trained, it can be used to visualize arbitrary graphs according to the style of the example layouts or the chosen aesthetic criteria. The comprehensive experimental studies show that SmartGD outperforms 12 benchmark methods according to the commonly agreed metrics. ",

    "abstract": "Near-term quantum computers can hold only a small number of qubits. One way to facilitate large-scale quantum computations is through a distributed network of quantum computers. In this work, we consider the problem of distributing quantum programs represented as quantum circuits across a quantum network of heterogeneous quantum computers, in a way that minimizes the overall communication cost required to execute the distributed circuit. We consider two ways of communicating: cat-entanglement that creates linked copies of qubits across pairs of computers, and teleportation. The heterogeneous computers impose constraints on cat-entanglement and teleportation operations that can be chosen by an algorithm. We first focus on a special case that only allows cat-entanglements and not teleportations for communication. We provide a two-step heuristic for solving this specialized setting: (i) finding an assignment of qubits to computers using Tabu search, and (ii) using an iterative greedy algorithm designed for a constrained version of the set cover problem to determine cat-entanglement operations required to execute gates locally. For the general case, which allows both forms of communication, we propose two algorithms that subdivide the quantum circuit into several portions and apply the heuristic for the specialized setting on each portion. Teleportations are then used to stitch together the solutions for each portion. Finally, we simulate our algorithms on a wide range of randomly generated quantum networks and circuits, and study the properties of their results with respect to several varying parameters. ",

In this work it is shown how the landscape of one class of projects, specifically those used as social media profile pictures, has become mainstream with leading projects such as \"Bored Ape Yacht Club\", \"Cool Cats\" and \"Doodles\". This work illustrates how heterogeneous data was collected from the Ethereum blockchain and Twitter and then analysed using algorithms and state-of-art metrics related to graphs. The initial results show that from a social network perspective, the collections of most popular NFTs can be considered as a single community around NFTs. Thus, while each project has its own value and volume of exchange, on a social level all of them are primarily influenced by the evolution of values and trades of \"Bored Ape Yacht Club\" collection.

    "abstract": "Representation learning of source code is essential for applying machine learning to software engineering tasks. Learning code representation across different programming languages has been shown to be more effective than learning from single-language datasets, since more training data from multi-language datasets improves the model's ability to extract language-agnostic information from source code. However, existing multi-language models overlook the language-specific information which is crucial for downstream tasks that is training on multi-language datasets, while only focusing on learning shared parameters among the different languages. To address this problem, we propose MetaTPTrans, a meta learning approach for multilingual code representation learning. MetaTPTrans generates different parameters for the feature extractor according to the specific programming language of the input source code snippet, enabling the model to learn both language-agnostics and language-specific information. Experimental results show that MetaTPTrans improves the F1 score of state-of-the-art approaches significantly by up to 2.40 percentage points for code summarization, a language-agnostic task; and the prediction accuracy of Top-1 (Top-5) by up to 7.32 (13.15) percentage points for code completion, a language-specific task.

Most of the recent representation learning methods maximize cosine similarity or minimize the distance between the embedding features of different views from the same sample usually on the $l2$ normalized unit hypersphere. To prevent the trivial solutions that all samples have the same embedding feature, various techniques have been developed, such as contrastive learning, stop gradient, variance and covariance regularization, etc. In this study, we propose MUlti-Segmental Informational Coding (MUSIC) for self-supervised representation learning. MUSIC divides the embedding feature into multiple segments that discriminatively partition samples into different semantic clusters and different segments focus on different partition principles. Information theory measurements are directly used to optimize MUSIC and theoretically guarantee trivial solutions are avoided. MUSIC does not depend on commonly used techniques, such as memory bank or large batches, asymmetry networks, gradient stopping, momentum weight updating, etc, making the training framework flexible. Our experiments demonstrate that MUSIC achieves better results than most related Barlow Twins and VICReg methods on ImageNet classification with linear probing, and requires neither deep projectors nor large feature dimensions.

Furthermore, we extend ISL to a self-supervised learning setting where accurate causal structure discovery does not rely on any labels.

The further progress in ML heavily depends on success interpretable ML algorithms for mixed data and lossless interpretable visualization of multidimensional data. The later allows developing interpretable ML models using visual knowledge discovery by end-users, who can bring valuable domain knowledge which is absent in the training data.

However, recent work has shown that gains in average efficiency are not uniform across subgroups in the data, and in particular can often come at the cost of accuracy on rare subgroups and classes. To preserve strong performance across classes that may follow a long-tailed distribution, we develop distillation techniques that are tailored to improve the student's worst-class performance. Specifically, we introduce robust optimization objectives in different combinations for the teacher and student, and further allow for training with any tradeoff between the overall accuracy and the robust worst-class objective. We show empirically that our robust distillation techniques not only achieve better worst-class performance, but also lead to Pareto improvement in the tradeoff between overall performance and worst-class performance compared to other baseline methods. Theoretically, we provide insights into what makes a good teacher when the goal is to train a robust student. ",

    "abstract": "Volumetric neural rendering methods, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs), have enabled photo-realistic novel view synthesis. However, in their standard form, NeRFs do not support the editing of objects, such as a human head, within a scene. In this work, we propose RigNeRF, a system that goes beyond just novel view synthesis and enables full control of head pose and facial expressions learned from a single portrait video. We model changes in head pose and facial expressions using a deformation field that is guided by a 3D morphable face model (3DMM). The 3DMM effectively acts as a prior for RigNeRF that learns to predict only residuals to the 3DMM deformations and allows us to render novel (rigid) poses and (non-rigid) expressions that were not present in the input sequence. Using only a smartphone-captured short video of a subject for training, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on free view synthesis of a portrait scene with explicit head pose and expression controls.

    "abstract": "In this paper we describe, formalize, implement, and experimentally evaluate a novel transaction re-identification attack against official foreign-trade statistics releases in Brazil. The attack's goal is to re-identify the importers of foreign-trade transactions (by revealing the identity of the company performing that transaction), which consequently violates those importers' fiscal secrecy (by revealing sensitive information: the value and volume of traded goods). We provide a mathematical formalization of this fiscal secrecy problem using principles from the framework of quantitative information flow (QIF), then carefully identify the main sources of imprecision in the official data releases used as auxiliary information in the attack, and model transaction re-construction as a linear optimization problem solvable through integer linear programming (ILP). We show that this problem is NP-complete, and provide a methodology to identify tractable instances. We exemplify the feasibility of our attack by performing 2,003 transaction re-identifications that in total amount to more than \\$137M, and affect 348 Brazilian companies. Further, since similar statistics are produced by other statistical agencies, our attack is of broader concern. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial training (AT) and its variants have spearheaded progress in improving neural network robustness to adversarial perturbations and common corruptions in the last few years. Algorithm design of AT and its variants are focused on training models at a specified perturbation strength $\\epsilon$ and only using the feedback from the performance of that $\\epsilon$-robust model to improve the algorithm. In this work, we focus on models, trained on a spectrum of $\\epsilon$ values. We analyze three perspectives: model performance, intermediate feature precision and convolution filter sensitivity. In each, we identify alternative improvements to AT that otherwise wouldn't have been apparent at a single $\\epsilon$. Specifically, we find that for a PGD attack at some strength $\\delta$, there is an AT model at some slightly larger strength $\\epsilon$, but no greater, that generalizes best to it. Hence, we propose overdesigning for robustness where we suggest training models at an $\\epsilon$ just above $\\delta$. Second, we observe (across various $\\epsilon$ values) that robustness is highly sensitive to the precision of intermediate features and particularly those after the first and second layer. Thus, we propose adding a simple quantization to defenses that improves accuracy on seen and unseen adaptive attacks. Third, we analyze convolution filters of each layer of models at increasing $\\epsilon$ and notice that those of the first and second layer may be solely responsible for amplifying input perturbations. We present our findings and demonstrate our techniques through experiments with ResNet and WideResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-10-C datasets. ",

We propose to model topologically complex datasets using vector bundles, in such a way that the base space accounts for the large scale topology, while the fibers account for the local geometry. This allows one to reduce the dimensionality of the fibers, while preserving the large scale topology. We formalize this point of view, and, as an application, we describe an algorithm which takes as input a dataset together with an initial representation of it in Euclidean space, assumed to recover part of its large scale topology, and outputs a new representation that integrates local representations, obtained through local linear dimensionality reduction, along the initial global representation. We demonstrate this algorithm on examples coming from dynamical systems and chemistry. In these examples, our algorithm is able to learn topologically faithful embeddings of the data in lower target dimension than various well known metric-based dimensionality reduction algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, one of the most popular techniques in the computer vision community has been the deep learning technique. As a data-driven technique, deep model requires enormous amounts of accurately labelled training data, which is often inaccessible in many real-world applications. A data-space solution is Data Augmentation (DA), that can artificially generate new images out of original samples. Image augmentation strategies can vary by dataset, as different data types might require different augmentations to facilitate model training. However, the design of DA policies has been largely decided by the human experts with domain knowledge, which is considered to be highly subjective and error-prone. To mitigate such problem, a novel direction is to automatically learn the image augmentation policies from the given dataset using Automated Data Augmentation (AutoDA) techniques. The goal of AutoDA models is to find the optimal DA policies that can maximize the model performance gains. This survey discusses the underlying reasons of the emergence of AutoDA technology from the perspective of image classification. We identify three key components of a standard AutoDA model: a search space, a search algorithm and an evaluation function. Based on their architecture, we provide a systematic taxonomy of existing image AutoDA approaches. This paper presents the major works in AutoDA field, discussing their pros and cons, and proposing several potential directions for future improvements. ",

SBST techniques are effective at generating tests with high code coverage. However, is high code coverage sufficient to maximise the number of bugs found? We argue that SBST needs to be focused to search for test cases in defective areas rather in non-defective areas of the code in order to maximise the likelihood of discovering the bugs. Defect prediction algorithms give useful information about the bug-prone areas in software. Therefore, we formulate the objective of this thesis: \\textit{Improve the bug detection capability of SBST by incorporating defect prediction information}. To achieve this, we devise two research objectives, i.e., 1) Develop a novel approach (SBST$_{CL}$) that allocates time budget to classes based on the likelihood of classes being defective, and 2) Develop a novel strategy (SBST$_{ML}$) to guide the underlying search algorithm (i.e., genetic algorithm) towards the defective areas in a class. Through empirical evaluation on 434 real reported bugs in the Defects4J dataset, we demonstrate that our novel approach, SBST$_{CL}$, is significantly more efficient than the state of the art SBST when they are given a tight time budget in a resource constrained environment.

However, it is actually difficult to train a satisfactory teacher GNN due to the well-known over-parametrized and over-smoothing issues, leading to invalid knowledge transfer in practical applications. In this paper, we propose the first Free-direction Knowledge Distillation framework via Reinforcement learning for GNNs, called FreeKD, which is no longer required to provide a deeper well-optimized teacher GNN. The core idea of our work is to collaboratively build two shallower GNNs in an effort to exchange knowledge between them via reinforcement learning in a hierarchical way. As we observe that one typical GNN model often has better and worse performances at different nodes during training, we devise a dynamic and free-direction knowledge transfer strategy that consists of two levels of actions: 1) node-level action determines the directions of knowledge transfer between the corresponding nodes of two networks; and then 2) structure-level action determines which of the local structures generated by the node-level actions to be propagated. In essence, our FreeKD is a general and principled framework which can be naturally compatible with GNNs of different architectures. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate our FreeKD outperforms two base GNNs in a large margin, and shows its efficacy to various GNNs. More surprisingly, our FreeKD has comparable or even better performance than traditional KD algorithms that distill knowledge from a deeper and stronger teacher GNN. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the problem of data pre-storing and routing in dynamic, resource-constrained cube satellite networks is studied. In such a network, each cube satellite delivers requested data to user clusters under its coverage. A group of ground gateways will route and pre-store certain data to the satellites, such that the ground users can be directly served with the pre-stored data. This pre-storing and routing design problem is formulated as a decentralized Markov decision process (Dec-MDP) in which we seek to find the optimal strategy that maximizes the pre-store hit rate, i.e., the fraction of users being directly served with the pre-stored data. To obtain the optimal strategy, a distributed distribution-robust meta reinforcement learning (D2-RMRL) algorithm is proposed that consists of three key ingredients: value-decomposition for achieving the global optimum in distributed setting with minimum communication overhead, meta learning to obtain the optimal initial to reduce the training time under dynamic conditions, and pre-training to further speed up the meta training procedure. Simulation results show that, using the proposed value decomposition and meta training techniques, the satellite networks can achieve a 31.8% improvement of the pre-store hits and a 40.7% improvement of the convergence speed, compared to a baseline reinforcement learning algorithm. Moreover, the use of the proposed pre-training mechanism helps to shorten the meta-learning procedure by up to 43.7%. ",

These sounds were presented to normal hearing (NH) listeners whose cognitive function could be assumed to be normal. The results showed that the divergence was larger in the remote experiments than in the laboratory ones. However, the remote results could be equalized to the laboratory ones, mostly through data screening using the results of tone pip tests prepared on the experimental web page.

    "abstract": "High-fidelity reconstruction of fluids from sparse multiview RGB videos remains a formidable challenge due to the complexity of the underlying physics as well as complex occlusion and lighting in captures. Existing solutions either assume knowledge of obstacles and lighting, or only focus on simple fluid scenes without obstacles or complex lighting, and thus are unsuitable for real-world scenes with unknown lighting or arbitrary obstacles. We present the first method to reconstruct dynamic fluid by leveraging the governing physics (ie, Navier -Stokes equations) in an end-to-end optimization from sparse videos without taking lighting conditions, geometry information, or boundary conditions as input. We provide a continuous spatio-temporal scene representation using neural networks as the ansatz of density and velocity solution functions for fluids as well as the radiance field for static objects. With a hybrid architecture that separates static and dynamic contents, fluid interactions with static obstacles are reconstructed for the first time without additional geometry input or human labeling. By augmenting time-varying neural radiance fields with physics-informed deep learning, our method benefits from the supervision of images and physical priors. To achieve robust optimization from sparse views, we introduced a layer-by-layer growing strategy to progressively increase the network capacity. Using progressively growing models with a new regularization term, we manage to disentangle density-color ambiguity in radiance fields without overfitting. A pretrained density-to-velocity fluid model is leveraged in addition as the data prior to avoid suboptimal velocity which underestimates vorticity but trivially fulfills physical equations. Our method exhibits high-quality results with relaxed constraints and strong flexibility on a representative set of synthetic and real flow captures. ",

One such security challenge is adversarial attacks. Although there has been much work demonstrating the susceptibility of DL-based classification tasks to adversarial attacks, regression-based problems in the context of a wireless system have not been studied so far from an attack perspective. The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) we consider a regression problem in a wireless setting and show that adversarial attacks can break the DL-based approach and (ii) we analyze the effectiveness of adversarial training as a defensive technique in adversarial settings and show that the robustness of DL-based wireless system against attacks improves significantly. Specifically, the wireless application considered in this paper is the DL-based power allocation in the downlink of a multicell massive multi-input-multi-output system, where the goal of the attack is to yield an infeasible solution by the DL model. We extend the gradient-based adversarial attacks: fast gradient sign method (FGSM), momentum iterative FGSM, and projected gradient descent method to analyze the susceptibility of the considered wireless application with and without adversarial training. We analyze the deep neural network (DNN) models performance against these attacks, where the adversarial perturbations are crafted using both the white-box and black-box attacks. ",

Theoretically, we prove the counting and metric properties of search spaces of TN-PS, analyzing for the first time the impact of TN structures on these unique properties.

Numerical results demonstrate that the new algorithm can reduce the required model size of TNs in extensive benchmarks, implying the improvement in the expressive power of TNs. Furthermore, the computational cost for the new algorithm is significantly less than that in~\\cite{li2020evolutionary}. ",

    "abstract": "Isolation forest (iForest) has been emerging as arguably the most popular anomaly detector in recent years. It iteratively performs axis-parallel data space partition in a tree structure to isolate deviated data objects from the other data, with the isolation difficulty of the objects defined as anomaly scores. iForest shows effective performance across popular dataset benchmarks, but its axis-parallel-based linear data partition is ineffective in handling hard anomalies in high-dimensional/non-linear-separable data space, and even worse, it leads to a notorious algorithmic bias that assigns unexpectedly large anomaly scores to artefact regions. There have been several extensions of iForest, but they still focus on linear data partition, failing to effectively isolate those hard anomalies. This paper introduces a novel extension of iForest, deep isolation forest. Our method offers a comprehensive isolation method that can arbitrarily partition the data at any random direction and angle on subspaces of any size, effectively avoiding the algorithmic bias in the linear partition. Further, it requires only randomly initialised neural networks (i.e., no optimisation is required in our method) to ensure the freedom of the partition. In doing so, desired randomness and diversity in both random network-based representations and random partition-based isolation can be fully leveraged to significantly enhance the isolation ensemble-based anomaly detection. Also, our approach offers a data-type-agnostic anomaly detection solution. It is versatile to detect anomalies in different types of data by simply plugging in corresponding randomly initialised neural networks in the feature mapping. Extensive empirical results on a large collection of real-world datasets show that our model achieves substantial improvement over state-of-the-art isolation-based and non-isolation-based anomaly detection models.

    "abstract": "Clustering-based methods, which alternate between the generation of pseudo labels and the optimization of the feature extraction network, play a dominant role in both unsupervised learning (USL) and unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) person re-identification (Re-ID). To alleviate the adverse effect of noisy pseudo labels, the existing methods either abandon unreliable labels or refine the pseudo labels via mutual learning or label propagation. However, a great many erroneous labels are still accumulated because these methods mostly adopt traditional unsupervised clustering algorithms which rely on certain assumptions on data distribution and fail to capture the distribution of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose the plug-and-play graph-based pseudo label correction network (GLC) to refine the pseudo labels in the manner of supervised clustering. GLC is trained to perceive the varying data distribution at each epoch of the self-training with the supervision of initial pseudo labels generated by any clustering method. It can learn to rectify the initial noisy labels by means of the relationship constraints between samples on the k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) graph and early-stop training strategy. Specifically, GLC learns to aggregate node features from neighbors and predict whether the nodes should be linked on the graph. Besides, GLC is optimized with 'early stop' before the noisy labels are severely memorized to prevent overfitting to noisy pseudo labels. Consequently, GLC improves the quality of pseudo labels though the supervision signals contain some noise, leading to better Re-ID performance. Extensive experiments in USL and UDA person Re-ID on Market-1501 and MSMT17 show that our method is widely compatible with various clustering-based methods and promotes the state-of-the-art performance consistently.

Despite the promising results, the label mismatch problem is not yet fully explored in the previous works, leading to severe confirmation bias during self-training. In this paper, we delve into this problem and propose a simple yet effective LabelMatch framework from two different yet complementary perspectives, i.e., distribution-level and instance-level. For the former one, it is reasonable to approximate the class distribution of the unlabeled data from that of the labeled data according to Monte Carlo Sampling. Guided by this weakly supervision cue, we introduce a re-distribution mean teacher, which leverages adaptive label-distribution-aware confidence thresholds to generate unbiased pseudo labels to drive student learning. For the latter one, there exists an overlooked label assignment ambiguity problem across teacher-student models. To remedy this issue, we present a novel label assignment mechanism for self-training framework, namely proposal self-assignment, which injects the proposals from student into teacher and generates accurate pseudo labels to match each proposal in the student model accordingly. Experiments on both MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC datasets demonstrate the considerable superiority of our proposed framework to other state-of-the-arts.

Finally, the local static environment is described via multiple convex polygons, which is realized throungh the double threshold-based boundary simplification and the convex polygon segmentation. Our proposed approach has been applied in a practical driverless project in the park, and the qualitative experimental results on typical scenes verify the effectiveness and robustness. In addition, the quantitative evaluation shows the superior performance on making use of fewer number of points information (decreased by about 60%) to represent the local static environment compared with the traditional grid map-based methods. Furthermore, the performance of running time (15ms) shows that the proposed approach can be used for real-time local static environment perception.

    "abstract": "Temporal/spatial receptive fields of models play an important role in sequential/spatial tasks. Large receptive fields facilitate long-term relations, while small receptive fields help to capture the local details. Existing methods construct models with hand-designed receptive fields in layers. Can we effectively search for receptive field combinations to replace hand-designed patterns? To answer this question, we propose to find better receptive field combinations through a global-to-local search scheme. Our search scheme exploits both global search to find the coarse combinations and local search to get the refined receptive field combinations further. The global search finds possible coarse combinations other than human-designed patterns. On top of the global search, we propose an expectation-guided iterative local search scheme to refine combinations effectively. Our RF-Next models, plugging receptive field search to various models, boost the performance on many tasks, e.g., temporal action segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, and speech synthesis.

    "abstract": "How to train an ideal teacher for knowledge distillation is still an open problem. It has been widely observed that a teacher minimizing the empirical risk not necessarily yields the best performing student, suggesting a fundamental discrepancy between the common practice in teacher network training and the distillation objective. To fill this gap, we propose a novel student-oriented teacher network training framework SoTeacher, inspired by recent findings that student performance hinges on teacher's capability to approximate the true label distribution of training samples. We theoretically established that (1) the empirical risk minimizer with proper scoring rules as loss function can provably approximate the true label distribution of training data if the hypothesis function is locally Lipschitz continuous around training samples; and (2) when data augmentation is employed for training, an additional constraint is required that the minimizer has to produce consistent predictions across augmented views of the same training input. In light of our theory, SoTeacher renovates the empirical risk minimization by incorporating Lipschitz regularization and consistency regularization. It is worth mentioning that SoTeacher is applicable to almost all teacher-student architecture pairs, requires no prior knowledge of the student upon teacher's training, and induces almost no computation overhead. Experiments on two benchmark datasets confirm that SoTeacher can improve student performance significantly and consistently across various knowledge distillation algorithms and teacher-student pairs.

Existing weakly-supervised semantic segmentation methods in computer vision achieve degenerative results for gland segmentation, since the characteristics and problems of glandular datasets are different from general object datasets. We observe that, unlike natural images, the key problem with histology images is the confusion of classes owning to morphological homogeneity and low color contrast among different tissues. To this end, we propose a novel method Online Easy Example Mining (OEEM) that encourages the network to focus on credible supervision signals rather than noisy signals, therefore mitigating the influence of inevitable false predictions in pseudo-masks.

Where risk is viewed as a product of threat, vulnerability, and impact, understanding each element is of equal importance. This can be a challenge in Industrial Control System (ICS) environments, where adopted technologies are typically not only bespoke, but interact directly with the physical world. To date, existing vulnerability identification has focused on traditional vulnerability categories. While this provides risk assessors with a baseline understanding, and the ability to hypothesize on potential resulting impacts, it is high level, operating at a level of abstraction that would be viewed as incomplete within a traditional information system context. The work presented in this paper takes the understanding of ICS device vulnerabilities one step further. It offers a tool, PLC-VBS, that helps identify Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) vulnerabilities, specifically within logic used to monitor, control, and automate operational processes. PLC-VBS gives risk assessors a more coherent picture about the potential impact should the identified vulnerabilities be exploited; this applies specifically to operational process elements. ",

However, we ensure that we generate runs close to their true distribution by generating an appropriate abstraction of the original system and utilizing it in the simulation process. Interestingly, as a by-product, we also obtain a yet more efficient simulation scheme, yielding runs over the system's abstraction. These provide a very faithful approximation of concrete runs on the desired level of granularity, at a low cost.

    "abstract": "It is crucial to consider the social and ethical consequences of AI and ML based decisions for the safe and acceptable use of these emerging technologies. Fairness, in particular, guarantees that the ML decisions do not result in discrimination against individuals or minorities. Identifying and measuring reliably fairness/discrimination is better achieved using causality which considers the causal relation, beyond mere association, between the sensitive attribute (e.g. gender, race, religion, etc.) and the decision (e.g. job hiring, loan granting, etc.). The big impediment to the use of causality to address fairness, however, is the unavailability of the causal model (typically represented as a causal graph). Existing causal approaches to fairness in the literature do not address this problem and assume that the causal model is available. In this paper, we do not make such assumption and we review the major algorithms to discover causal relations from observable data. This study focuses on causal discovery and its impact on fairness. In particular, we show how different causal discovery approaches may result in different causal models and, most importantly, how even slight differences between causal models can have significant impact on fairness/discrimination conclusions. These results are consolidated by empirical analysis using synthetic and standard fairness benchmark datasets. The main goal of this study is to highlight the importance of the causal discovery step to appropriately address fairness using causality. ",

We apply the graphical Granger model (GGM) to obtain the so-called Granger causal graph among joints as a discriminative and visually interpretable representation of a person's gait. We evaluate eleven distance functions in the GGM feature space by established classification and class-separability evaluation metrics. Our experiments indicate that, depending on the metric, the most appropriate distance functions for the GGM are the total norm distance and the Ky-Fan 1-norm distance. Experiments also show that the GGM is able to detect the most discriminative joint interactions and that it outperforms five related interpretable models in correct classification rate and in Davies-Bouldin index. The proposed GGM model can serve as a complementary tool for gait analysis in kinesiology or for gait recognition in video surveillance. ",

Recent methods mostly adopt a neural shape representation with a neural network to represent a signed distance field and fit the point cloud with an unsigned supervision. However, we observe that using unsigned supervision may cause severe ambiguities and often leads to \\emph{unexpected} failures such as generating undesired surfaces in free space when reconstructing complex structures and struggle with reconstructing accurate surfaces. To reconstruct a better signed distance field, we propose semi-signed neural fitting (SSN-Fitting), which consists of a semi-signed supervision and a loss-based region sampling strategy. Our key insight is that signed supervision is more informative and regions that are obviously outside the object can be easily determined. Meanwhile, a novel importance sampling is proposed to accelerate the optimization and better reconstruct the fine details. Specifically, we voxelize and partition the object space into \\emph{sign-known} and \\emph{sign-uncertain} regions, in which different supervisions are applied. Also, we adaptively adjust the sampling rate of each voxel according to the tracked reconstruction loss, so that the network can focus more on the complex under-fitting regions. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that SSN-Fitting achieves state-of-the-art performance under different settings on multiple datasets, including clean, density-varying, and noisy data.

    "abstract": "A neural network-based energy management system (NN-EMS) has been proposed in this paper for islanded ac microgrids fed by multiple PV-battery based distributed generators (DG). The stochastic and unequal irradiation results in unequal PV output, which causes an unequal state-of-charge (SoC) among the batteries of the DGs. This effect may cause the difference in the SoCs to increase considerably over time, leading to some batteries reaching their SoC limits. These batteries would no longer be able to control the dc-link of the hybrid grid forming DG. The proposed NN-EMS ensures SoC balancing by learning an optimal state-action mapping using the outputs of an optimal power flow (OPF). The training dataset has been generated by executing a mixed-integer linear programming based OPF for droop-based island microgrids considering a practical generation-load profile. The resultant NN-EMS controller inherits the information of optimal states and the network behaviour. Compared to traditional time-ahead centralized methods, the proposed strategy does not require accurate generation-load forecasting. Further, it can also respond to the variations in the PV power in near-real-time without resorting to solving an OPF. The proposed NN-EMS controller has been validated by case studies on a CIGRE LV microgrid containing PV-battery hybrid DGs. The proposed concept can also be extended to synthesize decentralized controllers that can cooperate among themselves to achieve a global objective without communication. ",

The successful registration relies on extracting robust and discriminative geometric features. Existing learning-based methods require high computing capacity for processing a large number of raw points at the same time. Although these approaches achieve convincing results, they are difficult to apply in real-world situations due to high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce a framework that efficiently and economically extracts dense features using graph attention network for point cloud matching and registration (DFGAT). The detector of the DFGAT is responsible for finding highly reliable key points in large raw data sets. The descriptor of the DFGAT takes these key points combined with their neighbors to extract invariant density features in preparation for the matching. The graph attention network uses the attention mechanism that enriches the relationships between point clouds. Finally, we consider this as an optimal transport problem and use the Sinkhorn algorithm to find positive and negative matches. We perform thorough tests on the KITTI dataset and evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. The results show that this method with the efficiently compact keypoint selection and description can achieve the best performance matching metrics and reach highest success ratio of 99.88% registration in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches.

However, this impressive performance raises the question: Are these robustness gains provided by randomized ensembles real? In this work we address this question both theoretically and empirically. We first establish theoretically that commonly employed robustness evaluation methods such as adaptive PGD provide a false sense of security in this setting. Subsequently, we propose a theoretically-sound and efficient adversarial attack algorithm (ARC) capable of compromising random ensembles even in cases where adaptive PGD fails to do so. We conduct comprehensive experiments across a variety of network architectures, training schemes, datasets, and norms to support our claims, and empirically establish that randomized ensembles are in fact more vulnerable to $\\ell_p$-bounded adversarial perturbations than even standard AT models.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been massively applied to the field of social bot detection, a huge amount of domain expertise and prior knowledge is heavily engaged in the state-of-the art approaches to design a dedicated neural network architecture for a specific classification task. Involving oversized nodes and network layers in the model design, however, usually causes the over-smoothing problem and the lack of embedding discrimination. In this paper, we propose RoSGAS, a novel Reinforced and Self-supervised GNN Architecture Search framework to adaptively pinpoint the most suitable multi-hop neighborhood and the number of layers in the GNN architecture. More specifically, we consider the social bot detection problem as a user-centric subgraph embedding and classification task. We exploit heterogeneous information network to present the user connectivity by leveraging account metadata, relationships, behavioral features and content features. RoSGAS uses a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) mechanism for navigating the search of optimal neighborhood and network layers to learn individually the subgraph embedding for each target user. A nearest neighbor mechanism is developed for accelerating the RL training process, and RoSGAS can learn more discriminative subgraph embedding with the aid of self-supervised learning. Experiments on 5 Twitter datasets show that RoSGAS outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy, training efficiency and stability, and has better generalization when handling unseen samples.

To this end, we first represent general formulations for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the product of two arbitrary random variables, exploiting copula theory. This is used to derive the closed-form expressions of the ergodic capacity and outage probability in a SWIPT relay network under correlated Nakagami-m fading channels.

Various approaches have been investigated including Bayesian neural networks, ensembles, deterministic approximations, amongst others. Despite the growing litterature about uncertainty quantification in deep learning, the quality of the uncertainty estimates remains an open question. In this work, we attempt to assess the performance of several algorithms on sampling and regression tasks by evaluating the quality of the confidence regions and how well the generated samples are representative of the unknown target distribution. Towards this end, several sampling and regression tasks are considered, and the selected algorithms are compared in terms of coverage probabilities, kernelized Stein discrepancies, and maximum mean discrepancies.

It has been shown that training agents in simple settings before moving them on to complex settings improves the training process, but so far only in the context of relatively simple locomotion skills. In this work, we adapt the Enhanced Paired Open-Ended Trailblazer (ePOET) approach to train more complex agents to walk efficiently on complex three-dimensional terrains. First, to generate more rugged and diverse three-dimensional training terrains with increasing complexity, we extend the Compositional Pattern Producing Networks - Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (CPPN-NEAT) approach and include randomized shapes. Second, we combine ePOET with Soft Actor-Critic off-policy optimization, yielding ePOET-SAC, to ensure that the agent could learn more diverse skills to solve more challenging tasks. Our experimental results show that the newly generated three-dimensional terrains have sufficient diversity and complexity to guide learning, that ePOET successfully learns complex locomotion skills on these terrains, and that our proposed ePOET-SAC approach slightly improves upon ePOET.

It is widely studied; in Psycholinguistics, for instance, we have a variety of competing studies for the human disambiguation processes. These studies are empirical and based on eyetracking measurements. Here we take first steps towards formalizing these processes for semantic ambiguities where we identified the presence of two features: (1) joint plausibility degrees of different possible interpretations, (2) causal structures according to which certain words play a more substantial role in the processes. The novel sheaf-theoretic model of definite causality developed by Gogioso and Pinzani in QPL 2021 offers tools to model and reason about these features. We applied this theory to a dataset of ambiguous phrases extracted from Psycholinguistics literature and their human plausibility judgements collected by us using the Amazon Mechanical Turk engine. We measured the causal fractions of different disambiguation orders within the phrases and discovered two prominent orders: from subject to verb in the subject-verb and from object to verb in the verb object phrases. We also found evidence for delay in the disambiguation of polysemous vs homonymous verbs, again compatible with Psycholinguistic findings. ",

    "abstract": "This paper considers the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and provides a new best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm that works nearly optimally in both stochastic and adversarial settings. In stochastic settings, some existing BOBW algorithms achieve tight gap-dependent regret bounds of $O(\\sum_{i: \\Delta_i>0} \\frac{\\log T}{\\Delta_i})$ for suboptimality gap $\\Delta_i$ of arm $i$ and time horizon $T$. As Audibert et al. [2007] have shown, however, that the performance can be improved in stochastic environments with low-variance arms. In fact, they have provided a stochastic MAB algorithm with gap-variance-dependent regret bounds of $O(\\sum_{i: \\Delta_i>0} (\\frac{\\sigma_i^2}{\\Delta_i} + 1) \\log T )$ for loss variance $\\sigma_i^2$ of arm $i$. In this paper, we propose the first BOBW algorithm with gap-variance-dependent bounds, showing that the variance information can be used even in the possibly adversarial environment. Further, the leading constant factor in our gap-variance dependent bound is only (almost) twice the value for the lower bound. Additionally, the proposed algorithm enjoys multiple data-dependent regret bounds in adversarial settings and works well in stochastic settings with adversarial corruptions. The proposed algorithm is based on the follow-the-regularized-leader method and employs adaptive learning rates that depend on the empirical prediction error of the loss, which leads to gap-variance-dependent regret bounds reflecting the variance of the arms.

Now, in learning-based control, these functions are often represented with the help of artificial neural networks (NN). In this context, a recurring question is how to choose the topology of the NN in terms of depth, width, and activations in order to enable efficient learning. An elegant answer to that question could be a topology that, in principle, allows to exactly describe the function to be learned. Such solutions are already available for related problems. In fact, suitable topologies are known for piecewise affine (PWA) functions that can, for example, reflect the optimal control law in linear MPC. Following this direction, we show in this paper that convex PWQ functions can be exactly described by max-out-NN with only one hidden layer and two neurons. ",

A natural usage of ViTs in detection is to replace the CNN-based backbone with a transformer-based backbone, which is straightforward and effective, with the price of bringing considerable computation burden for inference. More subtle usage is the DETR family, which eliminates the need for many hand-designed components in object detection but introduces a decoder demanding an extra-long time to converge. As a result, transformer-based object detection can not prevail in large-scale applications. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel decoder-free fully transformer-based (DFFT) object detector, achieving high efficiency in both training and inference stages, for the first time. We simplify objection detection into an encoder-only single-level anchor-based dense prediction problem by centering around two entry points: 1) Eliminate the training-inefficient decoder and leverage two strong encoders to preserve the accuracy of single-level feature map prediction; 2) Explore low-level semantic features for the detection task with limited computational resources. In particular, we design a novel lightweight detection-oriented transformer backbone that efficiently captures low-level features with rich semantics based on a well-conceived ablation study. Extensive experiments on the MS COCO benchmark demonstrate that DFFT_SMALL outperforms DETR by 2.5% AP with 28% computation cost reduction and more than $10\\times$ fewer training epochs. Compared with the cutting-edge anchor-based detector RetinaNet, DFFT_SMALL obtains over 5.5% AP gain while cutting down 70% computation cost. ",

When BO is used to optimize a target function, we often have access to previous evaluations of potentially related functions. This begs the question as to whether we can leverage these previous experiences to accelerate the current BO task through meta-learning (meta-BO), while ensuring robustness against potentially harmful dissimilar tasks that could sabotage the convergence of BO. This paper introduces two scalable and provably robust meta-BO algorithms: robust meta-Gaussian process-upper confidence bound (RM-GP-UCB) and RM-GP-Thompson sampling (RM-GP-TS). We prove that both algorithms are asymptotically no-regret even when some or all previous tasks are dissimilar to the current task, and show that RM-GP-UCB enjoys a better theoretical robustness than RM-GP-TS. We also exploit the theoretical guarantees to optimize the weights assigned to individual previous tasks through regret minimization via online learning, which diminishes the impact of dissimilar tasks and hence further enhances the robustness. Empirical evaluations show that (a) RM-GP-UCB performs effectively and consistently across various applications, and (b) RM-GP-TS, despite being less robust than RM-GP-UCB both in theory and in practice, performs competitively in some scenarios with less dissimilar tasks and is more computationally efficient.

Usually, expensive text-code paired data is essential for training a code generation model. Recently, thanks to the success of pre-training techniques, large language models are trained on large-scale unlabelled code corpora and perform well in code generation. In this paper, we investigate how to leverage an unlabelled code corpus to train a model for library-oriented code generation. Since it is a common practice for programmers to reuse third-party libraries, in which case the text-code paired data are harder to obtain due to the huge number of libraries. We observe that library-oriented code snippets are more likely to share similar code sketches. Hence, we present CERT with two steps: a sketcher generates the sketch, then a generator fills the details in the sketch. Both the sketcher and the generator are continually pre-trained upon a base model using unlabelled data. Furthermore, we craft two benchmarks named PandasEval and NumpyEval to evaluate library-oriented code generation. Experimental results demonstrate the impressive performance of CERT. For example, it surpasses the base model by an absolute 15.67% improvement in terms of pass@1 on PandasEval. Our work is available at https://github.com/microsoft/PyCodeGPT. ",

In this paper, to improve the efficiency of neural speech enhancement, we introduce an LPC-based speech enhancement (LPCSE) architecture, which leverages the strong inductive biases in the LPC speech model in conjunction with the expressive power of neural networks. Differentiable end-to-end learning is achieved in LPCSE via two novel blocks: a block that utilizes the expert rules to reduce the computational overhead when integrating the LPC speech model into neural networks, and a block that ensures the stability of the model and avoids exploding gradients in end-to-end training by mapping the Linear prediction coefficients to the filter poles. The experimental results show that LPCSE successfully restores the formants of the speeches distorted by transmission loss, and outperforms two existing neural speech enhancement methods of comparable neural network sizes in terms of the Perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) and Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) on the LJ Speech corpus.

In most existing studies, semantic segmentation methods are typically used to achieve better results. The centroid of each target is calculated from the segmentation map as the detection result. In contrast, we propose a novel end-to-end framework for infrared small target detection and segmentation in this paper. First, with the use of UNet as the backbone to maintain resolution and semantic information, our model can achieve a higher detection accuracy than other state-of-the-art methods by attaching a simple anchor-free head. Then, a pyramid pool module is used to further extract features and improve the precision of target segmentation. Next, we use semantic segmentation tasks that pay more attention to pixel-level features to assist in the training process of object detection, which increases the average precision and allows the model to detect some targets that were previously not detectable. Furthermore, we develop a multi-task framework for infrared small target detection and segmentation. Our multi-task learning model reduces complexity by nearly half and speeds up inference by nearly twice compared to the composite single-task model, while maintaining accuracy.

RL approaches to automated penetration testing are actively being developed, but there is no consensus view on the representation of computer networks with which RL should be interacting. Moreover, there are significant open challenges to how those representations can be grounded to the real networks where RL solution methods are applied. This paper elaborates on representation and grounding using topic challenges of interacting with real networks in real-time, emulating realistic adversary behavior, and handling unstable, evolving networks. These challenges are both practical and mathematical, and they directly concern the reliability and dependability of penetration testing systems. This paper proposes a layered reference model to help organize related research and engineering efforts. The presented layered reference model contrasts traditional models of attack graph workflows because it is not scoped to a sequential, feed-forward generation and analysis process, but to broader aspects of lifecycle and continuous deployment. Researchers and practitioners can use the presented layered reference model as a first-principles outline to help orient the systems engineering of their penetration testing systems. ",

In this paper, we propose an efficient GNN-inspired algorithm, called the Edge Graph Neural Network (EGNN), to detect MIMO signals. We first compute graph edge weights through channel correlation and then leverage the obtained weights as a metric to evaluate the importance of neighbors of each node. Moreover, we design an adaptive Edge Drop (ED) scheme to sparsify the graph such that computational cost can be significantly reduced. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed EGNN achieves better or comparable performance to popular MIMO detection methods for different modulation schemes and costs the least detection time compared to GNN-based approaches.

    "title": "Exploring Representation of Horn Clauses using GNNs",
    "abstract": "Learning program semantics from raw source code is challenging due to the complexity of real-world programming language syntax and due to the difficulty of reconstructing long-distance relational information implicitly represented in programs using identifiers. Addressing the first point, we consider Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) as a standard representation of program verification problems, providing a simple and programming language-independent syntax. For the second challenge, we explore graph representations of CHCs, and propose a new Relational Hypergraph Neural Network (R-HyGNN) architecture to learn program features. We introduce two different graph representations of CHCs. One is called constraint graph (CG), and emphasizes syntactic information of CHCs by translating the symbols and their relations in CHCs as typed nodes and binary edges, respectively, and constructing the constraints as abstract syntax trees. The second one is called control- and data-flow hypergraph (CDHG), and emphasizes semantic information of CHCs by representing the control and data flow through ternary hyperedges. We then propose a new GNN architecture, R-HyGNN, extending Relational Graph Convolutional Networks, to handle hypergraphs. To evaluate the ability of R-HyGNN to extract semantic information from programs, we use R-HyGNNs to train models on the two graph representations, and on five proxy tasks with increasing difficulty, using benchmarks from CHC-COMP 2021 as training data. The most difficult proxy task requires the model to predict the occurrence of clauses in counter-examples, which subsumes satisfiability of CHCs. CDHG achieves 90.59% accuracy in this task. Furthermore, R-HyGNN has perfect predictions on one of the graphs consisting of more than 290 clauses. Overall, our experiments indicate that R-HyGNN can capture intricate program features for guiding verification problems. ",

    "title": "Frequency Throttling Side-Channel Attack",
    "abstract": "Modern processors dynamically control their operating frequency to optimize resource utilization, maximize energy savings, and to conform to system-defined constraints. If, during the execution of a software workload, the running average of any electrical or thermal parameter exceeds its corresponding predefined threshold value, the power management architecture will reactively adjust CPU frequency to ensure safe operating conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate how such power management-based CPU throttling activity forms a source of timing side-channel information leakage, which can be exploited by an attacker to infer secret data from a constant-cycle victim workload. We highlight the fact that a constant-cycle implementation of code does not necessarily guarantee its constant execution on different data inputs with respect to wall clock time. This is because existing throttling mechanisms perform data-dependent frequency adjustments, which in turn make the running time of the code also data-dependent. The proposed frequency throttling side-channel analysis attack can be launched by kernel-space attackers and user-space attackers, thus compromising security guarantees provided by isolation boundaries. We validate our attack methodology across different systems by performing experiments on a constant-cycle implementation of the AES-128 algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluations demonstrate how the attacker can successfully recover the targeted AES key by correlating the collected timing side-channel traces with the corresponding timing estimates for different key guesses, under frequency throttling. Finally, we discuss different options to mitigate the threat posed by frequency throttling side-channel attacks, as well as their advantages and disadvantages. ",

    "abstract": "In most PUF-based authentication schemes, a central server is usually engaged to verify the response of the device's PUF to challenge bit-streams. However, the server availability may be intermittent in practice. To tackle such an issue, this paper proposes a new protocol for supporting distributed authentication while avoiding vulnerability to information leakage where CRPs could be retrieved from hacked devices and collectively used to model the PUF. The main idea is to provision for scrambling the challenge bit-stream in a way that is dependent on the verifier. The scrambling pattern varies per authentication round for each device and independently across devices. In essence, the scrambling function becomes node- and packet-specific and the response received by two verifiers of one device for the same challenge bit-stream could vary. Thus, neither the scrambling function can be reverted, nor the PUF can be modeled even by a collusive set of malicious nodes. The validation results using data of an FPGA-based implementation demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in thwarting PUF modeling attacks by collusive actors. We also discuss the approach resiliency against impersonation, Sybil, and reverse engineering attacks. ",

    "abstract": "Data used in image segmentation are not always defined on the same grid. This is particularly true for medical images, where the resolution, field-of-view and orientation can differ across channels and subjects. Images and labels are therefore commonly resampled onto the same grid, as a pre-processing step. However, the resampling operation introduces partial volume effects and blurring, thereby changing the effective resolution and reducing the contrast between structures. In this paper we propose a splat layer, which automatically handles resolution mismatches in the input data. This layer pushes each image onto a mean space where the forward pass is performed. As the splat operator is the adjoint to the resampling operator, the mean-space prediction can be pulled back to the native label space, where the loss function is computed. Thus, the need for explicit resolution adjustment using interpolation is removed. We show on two publicly available datasets, with simulated and real multi-modal magnetic resonance images, that this model improves segmentation results compared to resampling as a pre-processing step.

For this reason, generative image models are highly sought after to facilitate data sharing. However, 3-D generative models are understudied, and investigation of their privacy leakage is needed. We introduce our 3-D generative model, Transversal GAN (TrGAN), using head & neck PET images which are conditioned on tumour masks as a case study. We define quantitative measures of image fidelity, utility and privacy for our model. These metrics are evaluated in the course of training to identify ideal fidelity, utility and privacy trade-offs and establish the relationships between these parameters. We show that the discriminator of the TrGAN is vulnerable to attack, and that an attacker can identify which samples were used in training with almost perfect accuracy (AUC = 0.99). We also show that an attacker with access to only the generator cannot reliably classify whether a sample had been used for training (AUC = 0.51). This suggests that TrGAN generators, but not discriminators, may be used for sharing synthetic 3-D PET data with minimal privacy risk while maintaining good utility and fidelity. ",

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is the most popular and widely used neuroimaging technique, and there is growing interest in fMRI-based markers of individual differences. However, its utility is often limited due to its high cost and difficulty acquiring from specific populations, including children and infants. Surrogate markers, or neural correlates of fMRI markers, would have important practical implications, but we have few stand-alone predictors for the fMRI markers. Here, using machine learning (ML) models and data augmentation, we predicted well-validated fMRI markers of human cognition from multivariate patterns of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a portable and relatively inexpensive optical neuroimaging technique. We recruited 50 human participants who performed two cognitive tasks (stop signal task and probabilistic reversal learning task), while neural activation was measured with either fNIRS or fMRI at each of the total two visits. Using ML models and data augmentation, we could predict the well-established fMRI markers of response inhibition or prediction error signals from 48-channel fNIRS activation in the prefrontal cortex. These results suggest that fNIRS might offer a surrogate marker of fMRI activation, which would broaden our understanding of various populations, including infants. ",

In this paper, we focus on multi-modal 3D MRI brain tumor segmentation and propose a dynamic architecture network named Med-DANet based on adaptive model selection to achieve effective accuracy and efficiency trade-off.

Extensive experimental results on both BraTS 2019 and 2020 datasets show that our proposed method achieves comparable or better results than previous state-of-the-art methods for 3D MRI brain tumor segmentation with much less model complexity.

Such an approach was taken in the original paper of SpectralNet (Shaham et al. 2018), which we call SpecNet1. The current paper introduces a new neural network approach, named SpecNet2, to compute spectral embedding which optimizes an equivalent objective of the eigen-problem and removes the orthogonalization layer in SpecNet1. SpecNet2 also allows separating the sampling of rows and columns of the graph affinity matrix by tracking the neighbors of each data point through the gradient formula. Theoretically, we show that any local minimizer of the new orthogonalization-free objective reveals the leading eigenvectors. Furthermore, global convergence for this new orthogonalization-free objective using a batch-based gradient descent method is proved. Numerical experiments demonstrate the improved performance and computational efficiency of SpecNet2 on simulated data and image datasets. ",

However, if everyone acts similarly, they all get the same piece they would obtain without extra effort. This is the involution game dilemma that can be detected in several real-life situations. It is also a realistic assumption that resources are not uniform in space and time, which may influence the system's resulting involution level. We here introduce spatio-temporal heterogeneity of social resources and explore their consequences on involution. When spatial heterogeneity is applied, network reciprocity can mitigate the involution for rich resources, which would be critical otherwise in a homogeneous population. Interestingly, when the resource level is modest, spatial heterogeneity causes more intensive involution in a system where most cooperator agents, who want to keep investment at a low level, are present. This picture is partly the opposite in the extreme case when more investment is less effective. Spatial heterogeneity can also produce a counterintuitive effect when the presence of alternative resource levels cannot explain the emergence of involution. If we apply temporal heterogeneity additionally, then the impact of spatial heterogeneity practically vanishes, and we turn back to the behavior observed in a homogeneous population earlier. Our observations are also supported by solving the corresponding replicator equations numerically. ",

We introduce COVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that evaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied to a region, predicts COVID-19 statistics (the daily number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths), and provides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should be. The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a geographical region by simulating the average number of new infections caused by an infected person considering the effect of external factors, such as environmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity), different variants of concern, vaccination rate, and mitigation measures. Using Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates that we are experiencing a deadly new wave that will peak on 26 January 2022, which is very similar in numbers to the wave we had in February 2020. The policy-makers have only one choice that is to increase the strength of the currently applied mitigation measures for 30 days. Unlike existing models, the COVIDHunter model accurately monitors and predicts the daily number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19. Our model is flexible to configure and simple to modify for modeling different scenarios under different environmental conditions and mitigation measures.

An automated image quality assessment based on the structural similarity index (SSIM) regression through a residual neural network has been proposed here, with the possibility to perform also the classification in different groups - by subdividing with SSIM ranges. This method predicts SSIM values of an input image in the absence of a reference ground truth image. The networks were able to detect motion artefacts, and the best performance for the regression and classification task has always been achieved with ResNet-18 with contrast augmentation.

To automatically and precisely detect it, various attempts have been made by using the latest deep learning (DL) technologies. However, even with these approaches, it is still practically difficult to determine the tip location because the multiple fragments phenomenon (MFP) occurs in the process of predicting and extracting the PICC line required before predicting the tip. This study aimed to develop a system generally applied to existing models and to restore the PICC line more exactly by removing the MFs of the model output, thereby precisely localizing the actual tip position for detecting its disposition. To achieve this, we proposed a multi-stage DL-based framework post-processing the PICC line extraction result of the existing technology. The performance was compared by each root mean squared error (RMSE) and MFP incidence rate according to whether or not MFCN is applied to five conventional models. In internal validation, when MFCN was applied to the existing single model, MFP was improved by an average of 45%. The RMSE was improved by over 63% from an average of 26.85mm (17.16 to 35.80mm) to 9.72mm (9.37 to 10.98mm). In external validation, when MFCN was applied, the MFP incidence rate decreased by an average of 32% and the RMSE decreased by an average of 65\\%. Therefore, by applying the proposed MFCN, we observed the significant/consistent detection performance improvement of PICC tip location compared to the existing model. ",

    "abstract": "Time-frequency (TF) representations in audio synthesis have been increasingly modeled with real-valued networks. However, overlooking the complex-valued nature of TF representations can result in suboptimal performance and require additional modules (e.g., for modeling the phase). To this end, we introduce complex-valued polynomial networks, called APOLLO, that integrate such complex-valued representations in a natural way. Concretely, APOLLO captures high-order correlations of the input elements using high-order tensors as scaling parameters. By leveraging standard tensor decompositions, we derive different architectures and enable modeling richer correlations. We outline such architectures and showcase their performance in audio generation across four benchmarks. As a highlight, APOLLO results in $17.5\\%$ improvement over adversarial methods and $8.2\\%$ over the state-of-the-art diffusion models on SC09 dataset in audio generation. Our models can encourage the systematic design of other efficient architectures on the complex field. ",

    "title": "Learning towards Synchronous Network Memorizability and Generalizability  for Continual Segmentation across Multiple Sites",
    "abstract": "In clinical practice, a segmentation network is often required to continually learn on a sequential data stream from multiple sites rather than a consolidated set, due to the storage cost and privacy restriction. However, during the continual learning process, existing methods are usually restricted in either network memorizability on previous sites or generalizability on unseen sites. This paper aims to tackle the challenging problem of Synchronous Memorizability and Generalizability (SMG) and to simultaneously improve performance on both previous and unseen sites, with a novel proposed SMG-learning framework. First, we propose a Synchronous Gradient Alignment (SGA) objective, which \\emph{not only} promotes the network memorizability by enforcing coordinated optimization for a small exemplar set from previous sites (called replay buffer), \\emph{but also} enhances the generalizability by facilitating site-invariance under simulated domain shift. Second, to simplify the optimization of SGA objective, we design a Dual-Meta algorithm that approximates the SGA objective as dual meta-objectives for optimization without expensive computation overhead. Third, for efficient rehearsal, we configure the replay buffer comprehensively considering additional inter-site diversity to reduce redundancy. Experiments on prostate MRI data sequentially acquired from six institutes demonstrate that our method can simultaneously achieve higher memorizability and generalizability over state-of-the-art methods.

To this end, DoWhy-GCM users first model cause-effect relations between variables in a system under study through a graphical causal model, fit the causal mechanisms of variables next, and then ask the causal question. All these steps take only a few lines of code in DoWhy-GCM. The library is available at https://github.com/py-why/dowhy. ",

    "abstract": "The classical Cox model emerged in 1972 promoting breakthroughs in how patient prognosis is quantified using time-to-event analysis in biomedicine. One of the most useful characteristics of the model for practitioners is the interpretability of the variables in the analysis. However, this comes at the price of introducing strong assumptions concerning the functional form of the regression model. To break this gap, this paper aims to exploit the explainability advantages of the classical Cox model in the setting of interval-censoring using a new Lasso neural network that simultaneously selects the most relevant variables while quantifying non-linear relations between predictors and survival times. The gain of the new method is illustrated empirically in an extensive simulation study with examples that involve linear and non-linear ground dependencies. We also demonstrate the performance of our strategy in the analysis of physiological, clinical and accelerometer data from the NHANES 2003-2006 waves to predict the effect of physical activity on the survival of patients. Our method outperforms the prior results in the literature that use the traditional Cox model. ",

We show that every poset with a planar cover graph and a unique minimal element has Boolean dimension at most 13. As a consequence, we are able to show that there is a reachability labeling scheme with labels consisting of $O(\\log n)$ bits for planar digraphs with a single source. The best known scheme for general planar digraphs uses labels with $O(\\log^2 n)$ bits [Thorup JACM 2004], and it remains open to determine whether a scheme using labels with $O(\\log n)$ bits exists. The Boolean dimension result is proved in tandem with a second result showing that the dimension of a poset with a planar cover graph and a unique minimal element is bounded by a linear function of its standard example number. However, one of the major challenges in dimension theory is to determine whether dimension is bounded in terms of standard example number for all posets with planar cover graphs. ",

To strive a balance between computational cost and reconstruction quality, we build an hierarchical structure with low-resolution and high-resolution decoders respectively. To validate the necessity of our proposed modules, we have conducted extensive experiments on two public datasets, and demonstrate superior or comparable performance over state-of-the-art approaches.

    "abstract": "Efficient and effective drug-target binding affinity (DTBA) prediction is a challenging task due to the limited computational resources in practical applications and is a crucial basis for drug screening. Inspired by the good representation ability of graph neural networks (GNNs), we propose a simple-structured GNN model named SS-GNN to accurately predict DTBA. By constructing a single undirected graph based on a distance threshold to represent protein-ligand interactions, the scale of the graph data is greatly reduced. Moreover, ignoring covalent bonds in the protein further reduces the computational cost of the model. The GNN-MLP module takes the latent feature extraction of atoms and edges in the graph as two mutually independent processes. We also develop an edge-based atom-pair feature aggregation method to represent complex interactions and a graph pooling-based method to predict the binding affinity of the complex. We achieve state-of-the-art prediction performance using a simple model (with only 0.6M parameters) without introducing complicated geometric feature descriptions. SS-GNN achieves Pearson's Rp=0.853 on the PDBbind v2016 core set, outperforming state-of-the-art GNN-based methods by 5.2%. Moreover, the simplified model structure and concise data processing procedure improve the prediction efficiency of the model. For a typical protein-ligand complex, affinity prediction takes only 0.2 ms. All codes are freely accessible at https://github.com/xianyuco/SS-GNN. ",
