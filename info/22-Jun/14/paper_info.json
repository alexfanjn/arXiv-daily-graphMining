    "title": "A heuristic method for data allocation and task scheduling on  heterogeneous multiprocessor systems under memory constraints",
    "abstract": "Computing workflows in heterogeneous multiprocessor systems are frequently modeled as directed acyclic graphs of tasks and data blocks, which represent computational modules and their dependencies in the form of data produced by a task and used by others. However, for some workflows, such as the task schedule in a digital signal processor may run out of memory by exposing too much parallelism. This paper focuses on the data allocation and task scheduling problem under memory constraints, and concentrates on shared memory platforms. We first propose an integer linear programming model to formulate the problem. Then we consider the problem as an extended flexible job shop scheduling problem, while trying to minimize the critical path of the graph. To solve this problem, we propose a tabu search algorithm (TS) which combines several distinguished features such as a greedy initial solution construction method and a mixed neighborhood evaluation strategy based on exact evaluation and approximate evaluation methods. Experimental results on randomly generated instances show that the the proposed TS algorithm can obtain relatively high-quality solutions in a reasonable computational time. In specific, the tabu search method averagely improves the makespan by 5-25\\% compared to the classical load balancing algorithm that are widely used in the literature. Besides, some key features of TS are also analyzed to identify its success factors. ",

    "title": "A General Framework for the Representation of Function and Affordance: A  Cognitive, Causal, and Grounded Approach, and a Step Toward AGI",
    "abstract": "In AI research, so far, the attention paid to the characterization and representation of function and affordance has been sporadic and sparse, even though this aspect features prominently in an intelligent system's functioning. In the sporadic and sparse, though commendable efforts so far devoted to the characterization and understanding of function and affordance, there has also been no general framework that could unify all the different use domains and situations related to the representation and application of functional concepts. This paper develops just such a general framework, with an approach that emphasizes the fact that the representations involved must be explicitly cognitive and conceptual, and they must also contain causal characterizations of the events and processes involved, as well as employ conceptual constructs that are grounded in the referents to which they refer, in order to achieve maximal generality. The basic genera framework is described, along with a set of basic guiding principles with regards to representation of functionality. To properly and adequately characterize and represent functionality, a descriptive representation language is needed. This language is defined and developed, and many examples of its use are described. The general framework is developed based on an extension of the general language meaning representational framework called conceptual dependency. To support the general characterization and representation of functionality, the basic conceptual dependency framework is enhanced with representational devices called structure anchor and conceptual dependency elaboration, together with the definition of a set of ground level concepts. These novel representational constructs are defined, developed, and described. A general framework dealing with functionality would represent a major step toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence. ",

    "abstract": "The security in networked systems depends greatly on recognizing and identifying adversarial behaviors. Traditional detection methods focus on specific categories of attacks and have become inadequate for increasingly stealthy and deceptive attacks that are designed to bypass detection strategically. This work aims to develop a holistic theory to countermeasure such evasive attacks. We focus on extending a fundamental class of statistical-based detection methods based on Neyman-Pearson's (NP) hypothesis testing formulation. We propose game-theoretic frameworks to capture the conflicting relationship between a strategic evasive attacker and an evasion-aware NP detector. By analyzing both the equilibrium behaviors of the attacker and the NP detector, we characterize their performance using Equilibrium Receiver-Operational-Characteristic (EROC) curves. We show that the evasion-aware NP detectors outperform the passive ones in the way that the former can act strategically against the attacker's behavior and adaptively modify their decision rules based on the received messages. In addition, we extend our framework to a sequential setting where the user sends out identically distributed messages. We corroborate the analytical results with a case study of anomaly detection.

    "abstract": "Gene Ontology (GO) is the primary gene function knowledge base that enables computational tasks in biomedicine. The basic element of GO is a term, which includes a set of genes with the same function. Existing research efforts of GO mainly focus on predicting gene term associations. Other tasks, such as generating descriptions of new terms, are rarely pursued. In this paper, we propose a novel task: GO term description generation. This task aims to automatically generate a sentence that describes the function of a GO term belonging to one of the three categories, i.e., molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. To address this task, we propose a Graph-in-Graph network that can efficiently leverage the structural information of GO. The proposed network introduces a two-layer graph: the first layer is a graph of GO terms where each node is also a graph (gene graph). Such a Graph-in-Graph network can derive the biological functions of GO terms and generate proper descriptions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed network, we build three large-scale benchmark datasets. By incorporating the proposed Graph-in-Graph network, the performances of seven different sequence-to-sequence models can be substantially boosted across all evaluation metrics, with up to 34.7%, 14.5%, and 39.1% relative improvements in BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR, respectively.

We propose a new method for classification which can improve robustness to distribution shifts, by combining expert knowledge about the ``high-level\" structure of the data with standard classifiers.

This step is based on features designed with expert guidance; for instance, for image data they can be extracted using digital image processing algorithms. Then, within each cluster, we learn local classifiers based on finer discriminating features, via standard models like deep neural networks. We establish generalization bounds for memory classifiers. We illustrate in experiments that they can improve generalization and robustness to distribution shifts on image datasets. We show improvements which push beyond standard data augmentation techniques. ",

It is unclear whether there are gender differences in the frequency of self-promotion or the benefits individuals get from it. Here, we examine gender differences in scholarly self-promotion using 7M Tweet mentions of 539K research papers published in 2018 by 1.3M authors. Our analysis shows that female authors are significantly less likely than male authors to promote their papers, even after controlling for a number of important factors including journal impact, affiliation prestige, author productivity and number of citations, authorship position, number of coauthors, and research topics. The magnitude of the gender gap is more strongly impacted by papers' journal impact than by authors' affiliation prestige, their previous productivity, or academic discipline. In particular, male scholars are 60\\% more likely to self-promote than comparable female scholars papers published in journals with very high impact factor, whereas the same probability is only 28\\% for publications in low impact journals. Although women self-promote less often overall, when they do, their papers receive slightly more mentions on Twitter. Our findings offer the first large-scale evidence for the gender gap in scholarly self-promotion online and unpack details about the circumstances under which discrepancies in self-promotion are the most substantial, helping inform policy aimed at closing the gender gap in visibility and recognition.

    "title": "Synthetic Over-sampling for Imbalanced Node Classification with Graph  Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for node classification. However, most existing GNNs would suffer from the graph imbalance problem. In many real-world scenarios, node classes are imbalanced, with some majority classes making up most parts of the graph. The message propagation mechanism in GNNs would further amplify the dominance of those majority classes, resulting in sub-optimal classification performance. In this work, we seek to address this problem by generating pseudo instances of minority classes to balance the training data, extending previous over-sampling-based techniques. This task is non-trivial, as those techniques are designed with the assumption that instances are independent. Neglection of relation information would complicate this oversampling process. Furthermore, the node classification task typically takes the semi-supervised setting with only a few labeled nodes, providing insufficient supervision for the generation of minority instances. Generated new nodes of low quality would harm the trained classifier. In this work, we address these difficulties by synthesizing new nodes in a constructed embedding space, which encodes both node attributes and topology information. Furthermore, an edge generator is trained simultaneously to model the graph structure and provide relations for new samples. To further improve the data efficiency, we also explore synthesizing mixed ``in-between'' nodes to utilize nodes from the majority class in this over-sampling process. Experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. ",

Recent physically-based differentiable rendering techniques for meshes have used edge-sampling to handle discontinuities, particularly at object silhouettes, but SDFs do not have a simple parametric form amenable to sampling. Instead, our approach builds on area-sampling techniques and develops a continuous warping function for SDFs to account for these discontinuities. Our method leverages the distance to surface encoded in an SDF and uses quadrature on sphere tracer points to compute this warping function. We further show that this can be done by subsampling the points to make the method tractable for neural SDFs. Our differentiable renderer can be used to optimize neural shapes from multi-view images and produces comparable 3D reconstructions to recent SDF-based inverse rendering methods, without the need for 2D segmentation masks to guide the geometry optimization and no volumetric approximations to the geometry.

Due to the nature of decentralized execution, federated learning is vulnerable to attacks from adversarial (Byzantine) clients by modifying the local updates to their desires. Therefore, it is important to develop robust federated learning algorithms that can defend Byzantine clients without losing model convergence and performance. In the study of robustness problems, a simulator can simplify and accelerate the implementation and evaluation of attack and defense strategies. However, there is a lack of open-source simulators to meet such needs. Herein, we present Blades, a scalable, extensible, and easily configurable simulator to assist researchers and developers in efficiently implementing and validating novel strategies against baseline algorithms in robust federated learning. Blades is built upon a versatile distributed framework Ray, making it effortless to parallelize single machine code from a single CPU to multi-core, multi-GPU, or multi-node with minimal configurations.

By contrast, existing MLP-based NeRFs are not able to directly receive observed views with an arbitrary number and require an auxiliary pooling-based operation to fuse source-view information, resulting in the missing of complicated relationships between source views and the target rendering view. Furthermore, current approaches process each 3D point individually and ignore the local consistency of a radiance field scene representation. These limitations potentially can reduce their performance in challenging real-world applications where large differences between source views and a novel rendering view may exist. To address these challenges, our TransNeRF utilizes the attention mechanism to naturally decode deep associations of an arbitrary number of source views into a coordinate-based scene representation. Local consistency of shape and appearance are considered in the ray-cast space and the surrounding-view space within a unified Transformer network. Experiments demonstrate that our TransNeRF, trained on a wide variety of scenes, can achieve better performance in comparison to state-of-the-art image-based neural rendering methods in both scene-agnostic and per-scene finetuning scenarios especially when there is a considerable gap between source views and a rendering view.

Relying on fully-supervised segmentation models requires collecting per-pixel labels, which is time-consuming and prone to overfitting. Self-supervised learning methods can help avoid the requirement of large annotated training datasets, however, to be useful in real-world applications, they should achieve good segmentation quality. In this paper, we introduce a Transformer-based method that uses self-supervision for high-quality fish segmentation. Our proposed model is trained on videos -- without any annotations -- to perform fish segmentation in underwater videos taken in situ in the wild. We show that when trained on a set of underwater videos from one dataset, the proposed model surpasses previous CNN-based and Transformer-based self-supervised methods and achieves performance relatively close to supervised methods on two new unseen underwater video datasets. This demonstrates the great generalisability of our model and the fact that it does not need a pre-trained model. In addition, we show that, due to its dense representation learning, our model is compute-efficient. We provide quantitative and qualitative results that demonstrate our model's significant capabilities. ",

Despite FL's unprecedented success in data privacy-preserving, its vulnerability to free-rider attacks has attracted increasing attention. Existing defenses may be ineffective against highly camouflaged or high percentages of free riders. To address these challenges, we reconsider the defense from a novel perspective, i.e., model weight evolving frequency.Empirically, we gain a novel insight that during the FL's training, the model weight evolving frequency of free-riders and that of benign clients are significantly different. Inspired by this insight, we propose a novel defense method based on the model Weight Evolving Frequency, referred to as WEF-Defense.Specifically, we first collect the weight evolving frequency (defined as WEF-Matrix) during local training. For each client, it uploads the local model's WEF-Matrix to the server together with its model weight for each iteration. The server then separates free-riders from benign clients based on the difference in the WEF-Matrix. Finally, the server uses a personalized approach to provide different global models for corresponding clients. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five datasets and five models demonstrate that WEF-Defense achieves better defense effectiveness than the state-of-the-art baselines. ",

In this work, we consider a more challenging but practically useful setting, in which a node itself is a graph instance. This leads to a hierarchical graph perspective which arises in many domains such as social network, biological network and document collection. We study the node classification problem in the hierarchical graph where a 'node' is a graph instance. As labels are usually limited, we design a novel semi-supervised solution named SEAL-CI. SEAL-CI adopts an iterative framework that takes turns to update two modules, one working at the graph instance level and the other at the hierarchical graph level. To enforce a consistency among different levels of hierarchical graph, we propose the Hierarchical Graph Mutual Information (HGMI) and further present a way to compute HGMI with theoretical guarantee. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this hierarchical graph modeling and the proposed SEAL-CI method on text and social network data. ",

Diverse sorting strategies and aggregation layout are also embedded into our parallel-based, directed and weighted hypergraph for illustrating combined causality. Our developed combined causality visual analysis system can help users effectively explore combined causes as well as an individual cause.

    "abstract": "Neural message passing is a basic feature extraction unit for graph-structured data that takes account of the impact of neighboring node features in network propagation from one layer to the next. We model such process by an interacting particle system with attractive and repulsive forces and the Allen-Cahn force arising in the modeling of phase transition. The system is a reaction-diffusion process which can separate particles to different clusters. This induces an Allen-Cahn message passing (ACMP) for graph neural networks where the numerical iteration for the solution constitutes the message passing propagation. The mechanism behind ACMP is phase transition of particles which enables the formation of multi-clusters and thus GNNs prediction for node classification. ACMP can propel the network depth to hundreds of layers with theoretically proven strictly positive lower bound of the Dirichlet energy. It thus provides a deep model of GNNs which circumvents the common GNN problem of oversmoothing. Experiments for various real node classification datasets, with possible high homophily difficulty, show the GNNs with ACMP can achieve state of the art performance with no decay of Dirichlet energy.

    "abstract": "Application migration and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) are indispensable means for fully exploiting the available potential in thermal optimization of a heterogeneous clustered multi-core processor under user-defined quality of service (QoS) targets. However, selecting the core to execute each application and the voltage/frequency (V/f) levels of each cluster is a complex problem because 1) the diverse characteristics and QoS targets of applications require different optimizations, and 2) per-cluster DVFS requires a global optimization considering all running applications. State-of-the-art resource management techniques for power or temperature minimization either rely on measurements that are often not available (such as power) or fail to consider all the dimensions of the problem (e.g., by using simplified analytical models). Imitation learning (IL) enables to use the optimality of an oracle policy, yet at low run-time overhead, by training a model from oracle demonstrations. We are the first to employ IL for temperature minimization under QoS targets. We tackle the complexity by training a neural network (NN) and accelerate the NN inference using a neural processing unit (NPU). While such NN accelerators are becoming increasingly widespread on end devices, they are so far only used to accelerate user applications. In contrast, we use an existing accelerator on a real platform to accelerate NN-based resource management. Our evaluation on a HiKey 970 board with an Arm big.LITTLE CPU and an NPU shows significant temperature reductions at a negligible run-time overhead, with unseen applications and different cooling than used for training.

Existing approaches such as deep autoencoder (DAE), variational autoencoder (VAE), conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) etc. have limited representation capabilities in the latent space and, hence, poor anomaly detection performance. Different models have to be trained for each different kind of machines to accurately perform the anomaly detection task. To solve this issue, we propose a new method named as hierarchical conditional variational autoencoder (HCVAE). This method utilizes available taxonomic hierarchical knowledge about industrial facility to refine the latent space representation. This knowledge helps model to improve the anomaly detection performance as well. We demonstrated the generalization capability of a single HCVAE model for different types of machines by using appropriate conditions. Additionally, to show the practicability of the proposed approach, (i) we evaluated HCVAE model on different domain and (ii) we checked the effect of partial hierarchical knowledge. Our results show that HCVAE method validates both of these points, and it outperforms the baseline system on anomaly detection task by utmost 15 % on the AUC score metric. ",

The main parameter concerned here is the computing rate, which is the average times of the target function that can be computed securely or user securely without error for one use of the network. In the secure case, a new upper bound which is tighter than the previous one is provided for arithmetic sum functions and arbitrary networks. Moreover, we show that the improved upper bound is strictly tight for tree-like networks. In the user secure case, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of user secure network codes and obtain an upper bound for the computation capacity. ",

    "abstract": "Over the past few years, deep learning (DL) has been continuously expanding its applications and becoming a driving force for large-scale source code analysis in the big code era. Distribution shift, where the test set follows a different distribution from the training set, has been a longstanding challenge for the reliable deployment of DL models due to the unexpected accuracy degradation. Although recent progress on distribution shift benchmarking has been made in domains such as computer vision and natural language process. Limited progress has been made on distribution shift analysis and benchmarking for source code tasks, on which there comes a strong demand due to both its volume and its important role in supporting the foundations of almost all industrial sectors. To fill this gap, this paper initiates to propose CodeS, a distribution shift benchmark dataset, for source code learning. Specifically, CodeS supports 2 programming languages (i.e., Java and Python) and 5 types of code distribution shifts (i.e., task, programmer, time-stamp, token, and CST). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to define the code representation-based distribution shifts. In the experiments, we first evaluate the effectiveness of existing out-of-distribution detectors and the reasonability of the distribution shift definitions and then measure the model generalization of popular code learning models (e.g., CodeBERT) on classification task. The results demonstrate that 1) only softmax score-based OOD detectors perform well on CodeS, 2) distribution shift causes the accuracy degradation in all code classification models, 3) representation-based distribution shifts have a higher impact on the model than others, and 4) pre-trained models are more resistant to distribution shifts. We make CodeS publicly available, enabling follow-up research on the quality assessment of code learning models. ",

    "abstract": "Through using only a well-trained classifier, model-inversion (MI) attacks can recover the data used for training the classifier, leading to the privacy leakage of the training data. To defend against MI attacks, previous work utilizes a unilateral dependency optimization strategy, i.e., minimizing the dependency between inputs (i.e., features) and outputs (i.e., labels) during training the classifier. However, such a minimization process conflicts with minimizing the supervised loss that aims to maximize the dependency between inputs and outputs, causing an explicit trade-off between model robustness against MI attacks and model utility on classification tasks. In this paper, we aim to minimize the dependency between the latent representations and the inputs while maximizing the dependency between latent representations and the outputs, named a bilateral dependency optimization (BiDO) strategy. In particular, we use the dependency constraints as a universally applicable regularizer in addition to commonly used losses for deep neural networks (e.g., cross-entropy), which can be instantiated with appropriate dependency criteria according to different tasks. To verify the efficacy of our strategy, we propose two implementations of BiDO, by using two different dependency measures: BiDO with constrained covariance (BiDO-COCO) and BiDO with Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (BiDO-HSIC). Experiments show that BiDO achieves the state-of-the-art defense performance for a variety of datasets, classifiers, and MI attacks while suffering a minor classification-accuracy drop compared to the well-trained classifier with no defense, which lights up a novel road to defend against MI attacks.

Task-relevant structures can be $localized$ or $sparse$ which are only involved in subgraphs or characterized by the interactions of subgraphs (a hierarchical perspective). A graph neural network should be able to efficiently extract task-relevant structures and be invariant to irrelevant parts, which is challenging for general message passing GNNs. In this work, we propose to learn graph representations from a sequence of subgraphs of the original graph to better capture task-relevant substructures or hierarchical structures and skip $noisy$ parts. To this end, we design soft-mask GNN layer to extract desired subgraphs through the mask mechanism. The soft-mask is defined in a continuous space to maintain the differentiability and characterize the weights of different parts. Compared with existing subgraph or hierarchical representation learning methods and graph pooling operations, the soft-mask GNN layer is not limited by the fixed sample or drop ratio, and therefore is more flexible to extract subgraphs with arbitrary sizes. Extensive experiments on public graph benchmarks show that soft-mask mechanism brings performance improvements. And it also provides interpretability where visualizing the values of masks in each layer allows us to have an insight into the structures learned by the model. ",

This paper proposes using an ensemble of such SSL representations and models, which exploits the complementary nature of the features extracted by the various pretrained models. We hypothesize that this results in a richer feature representation and shows results for the ASR downstream task. To this end, we use three SSL models that have shown excellent results on ASR tasks, namely HuBERT, Wav2vec2.0, and WaveLM. We explore the ensemble of models fine-tuned for the ASR task and the ensemble of features using the embeddings obtained from the pre-trained models for a downstream ASR task.

    "abstract": "The notion of neural collapse refers to several emergent phenomena that have been empirically observed across various canonical classification problems. During the terminal phase of training a deep neural network, the feature embedding of all examples of the same class tend to collapse to a single representation, and the features of different classes tend to separate as much as possible. Neural collapse is often studied through a simplified model, called the unconstrained feature representation, in which the model is assumed to have \"infinite expressivity\" and can map each data point to any arbitrary representation. In this work, we propose a more realistic variant of the unconstrained feature representation that takes the limited expressivity of the network into account. Empirical evidence suggests that the memorization of noisy data points leads to a degradation (dilation) of the neural collapse. Using a model of the memorization-dilation (M-D) phenomenon, we show one mechanism by which different losses lead to different performances of the trained network on noisy data. Our proofs reveal why label smoothing, a modification of cross-entropy empirically observed to produce a regularization effect, leads to improved generalization in classification tasks. ",

This protects the user privacy, but also makes the server difficult to verify data quality, especially if the data are correctly labeled. Training with corrupted labels is harmful to the federated learning task; however, little attention has been paid to FL in the case of label noise. In this paper, we focus on this problem and propose a learning-based reweighting approach to mitigate the effect of noisy labels in FL. More precisely, we tuned a weight for each training sample such that the learned model has optimal generalization performance over a validation set. More formally, the process can be formulated as a Federated Bilevel Optimization problem. Bilevel optimization problem is a type of optimization problem with two levels of entangled problems. The non-distributed bilevel problems have witnessed notable progress recently with new efficient algorithms. However, solving bilevel optimization problems under the Federated Learning setting is under-investigated. We identify that the high communication cost in hypergradient evaluation is the major bottleneck. So we propose \\textit{Comm-FedBiO} to solve the general Federated Bilevel Optimization problems; more specifically, we propose two communication-efficient subroutines to estimate the hypergradient. Convergence analysis of the proposed algorithms is also provided. Finally, we apply the proposed algorithms to solve the noisy label problem.

We propose NeuGuard, a new defense approach that jointly controls the output and inner neurons' activation with the object to guide the model output of training set and testing set to have close distributions. NeuGuard consists of class-wise variance minimization targeting restricting the final output neurons and layer-wise balanced output control aiming to constrain the inner neurons in each layer.

RNNs are used to approximate the solution on the subdomains, and the DG formulation is used to glue them together. Taking the Poisson problem as a model, we propose three numerical schemes and provide the convergence analyses. Then we extend the ideas to time-dependent problems. Taking the heat equation as a model, three space-time LRNN with DG formulations are proposed. Finally, we present numerical tests to demonstrate the performance of the methods developed herein. We compare the proposed methods with the finite element method and the usual DG method. The LRNN-DG methods can achieve better accuracy under the same degrees of freedom, signifying that this new approach has a great potential for solving partial differential equations. ",

    "abstract": "It is natural to generalize the $k$-Server problem by allowing each request to specify not only a point $p$, but also a subset $S$ of servers that may serve it. To attack this generalization, we focus on uniform and star metrics. For uniform metrics, the problem is equivalent to a generalization of Paging in which each request specifies not only a page $p$, but also a subset $S$ of cache slots, and is satisfied by having a copy of $p$ in some slot in $S$. We call this problem Slot-Heterogeneous Paging. We parameterize the problem by specifying an arbitrary family ${\\cal S} \\subseteq 2^{[k]}$, and restricting the sets $S$ to ${\\cal S}$. If all request sets are allowed (${\\cal S}=2^{[k]}$), the optimal deterministic and randomized competitive ratios are exponentially worse than for standard Paging (${\\cal S}=\\{[k]\\}$). As a function of $|{\\cal S}|$ and the cache size $k$, the optimal deterministic ratio is polynomial: at most $O(k^2|{\\cal S}|)$ and at least $\\Omega(\\sqrt{|{\\cal S}|})$. For any laminar family ${\\cal S}$ of height $h$, the optimal ratios are $O(hk)$ (deterministic) and $O(h^2\\log k)$ (randomized). The special case that we call All-or-One Paging extends standard Paging by allowing each request to specify a specific slot to put the requested page in. For All-or-One Paging the optimal competitive ratios are $\\Theta(k)$ (deterministic) and $\\Theta(\\log k)$ (randomized), while the offline problem is NP-hard. We extend the deterministic upper bound to the weighted variant of All-Or-One Paging (a generalization of standard Weighted Paging), showing that it is also $\\Theta(k)$. ",

Recently, to abstract a network's structural and dynamical attributes for utilization, network representation has been one focus, mapping a network or its substructures (like nodes) into a low-dimensional vector space. Since the current methods are mostly based on machine learning, a black box of an input-output data fitting mechanism, generally the space's dimension is indeterminable and its elements are not interpreted. Although massive efforts to cope with this issue have included, for example, automated machine learning by computer scientists and computational theory by mathematics, the root causes still remain unresolved. Given that, from a physical perspective, this article proposes two determinable and interpretable node representation methods. To evaluate their effectiveness and generalization, this article further proposes Adaptive and Interpretable ProbS (AIProbS), a network-based model that can utilize node representations for link prediction. Experimental results showed that the AIProbS can reach state-of-the-art precision beyond baseline models, and by and large it can make a good trade-off with machine learning-based models on precision, determinacy, and interpretability, indicating that physical methods could also play a large role in the study of network representation.

    "abstract": "Support for Machine Learning (ML) applications in networks has significantly improved over the last decade. The availability of public datasets and programmable switching fabrics (including low-level languages to program them) present a full-stack to the programmer for deploying in-network ML. However, the diversity of tools involved, coupled with complex optimization tasks of ML model design and hyperparameter tuning while complying with the network constraints (like throughput and latency), put the onus on the network operator to be an expert in ML, network design, and programmable hardware. This multi-faceted nature of in-network tools and expertise in ML and hardware is a roadblock for ML to become mainstream in networks, today. We present Homunculus, a high-level framework that enables network operators to specify their ML requirements in a declarative, rather than imperative way. Homunculus takes as input, the training data and accompanying network constraints, and automatically generates and installs a suitable model onto the underlying switching hardware. It performs model design-space exploration, training, and platform code-generation as compiler stages, leaving network operators to focus on acquiring high-quality network data. Our evaluations on real-world ML applications show that Homunculus's generated models achieve up to 12% better F1 score compared to hand-tuned alternatives, while requiring only 30 lines of single-script code on average. We further demonstrate the performance of the generated models on emerging per-packet ML platforms to showcase its timely and practical significance. ",

The rapid evolution of IFCSs in the last two decades in both the methodological and technical aspects necessitates a comprehensive view of them to better demonstrate the current stage and the crucial remaining steps towards developing a truly intelligent flight management unit. To this end, in this paper, we will provide a detailed mathematical view of Neural Network (NN)-based flight control systems and the challenging problems that still remain. The paper will cover both the model-based and model-free IFCSs. The model-based methods consist of the basic feedback error learning scheme, the pseudocontrol strategy, and the neural backstepping method. Besides, different approaches to analyze the closed-loop stability in IFCSs, their requirements, and their limitations will be discussed in detail. Various supplementary features, which can be integrated with a basic IFCS such as the fault-tolerance capability, the consideration of system constraints, and the combination of NNs with other robust and adaptive elements like disturbance observers, would be covered, as well. On the other hand, concerning model-free flight controllers, both the indirect and direct adaptive control systems including indirect adaptive control using NN-based system identification, the approximate dynamic programming using NN, and the reinforcement learning-based adaptive optimal control will be carefully addressed. Finally, by demonstrating a well-organized view of the current stage in the development of IFCSs, the challenging issues, which are critical to be addressed in the future, are thoroughly identified.

To adequately manage privacy requirements, organizations not only need to comply with privacy regulations, but also consider user privacy concerns. In this exploratory study, we used Reddit as a source to understand users' privacy concerns regarding software applications. We collected 4.5 million posts from Reddit and classified 129075 privacy related posts, which is a non-negligible number of privacy discussions. Next, we clustered these posts and identified 9 main areas of privacy concerns. We use the concept of narratives from economics (i.e., posts that can go viral) to explain the phenomenon of what and when users change in their discussion of privacy. We further found that privacy discussions change over time and privacy regulatory events have a short term impact on such discussions. However, narratives have a notable impact on what and when users discussed about privacy. Considering narratives could guide software organizations in eliciting the relevant privacy concerns before developing them as privacy requirements. ",

This work aims to utilize historic data to predict and diagnose incidents using spatio-temporal forecasting. We consider the specific use case of road traffic systems where incidents take the form of anomalous events, such as accidents or broken-down vehicles. To tackle this, we develop a neural model, called RadNet, which forecasts system parameters such as average vehicle speeds for a future timestep. As such systems largely follow daily or weekly periodicity, we compare RadNet's predictions against historical averages to label incidents. Unlike prior work, RadNet infers spatial and temporal trends in both permutations, finally combining the dense representations before forecasting. This facilitates informed inference and more accurate incident detection. Experiments with two publicly available and a new road traffic dataset demonstrate that the proposed model gives up to 8% higher prediction F1 scores compared to the state-of-the-art methods. ",

The NDN architecture adopts name-based routing and location-independent data retrieval. Among other important features, NDN integrates security mechanisms and focuses on protecting the content rather than the communications channels. Along with a new architecture come new threats and NDN is no exception. NDN is a potential target for new network attacks such as Interest Flooding Attacks (IFAs). Attackers take advantage of IFA to launch (D)DoS attacks in NDN. Many IFA detection and mitigation solutions have been proposed in the literature. However, there is no comprehensive review study of these solutions that has been proposed so far. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a survey of the various IFAs with a detailed comparative study of all the relevant proposed solutions as counter-measures against IFAs. We also review the requirements for a complete and efficient IFA solution and pinpoint the various issues encountered by IFA detection and mitigation mechanisms through a series of attack scenarios. Finally, in this survey, we offer an analysis of the open issues and future research directions regarding IFAs.

    "abstract": "Code churn and code velocity describe the evolution of a code base. Current research quantifies and studies code churn and velocity at a high level of abstraction, often at the overall project level or even at the level of an entire company. We argue that such an approach ignores noticeable differences among the subsystems of large projects. We conducted an exploratory study on four BSD family operating systems: DragonFlyBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD. We mine 797,879 commits to characterize code churn in terms of the annual growth rate, commit types, change type ratio, and size taxonomy of commits for different subsystems (kernel, non-kernel, and mixed). We also investigate differences among various code review periods, i.e., time-to-first-response, time-to-accept, and time-to-merge, as indicators of code velocity. Our study provides empirical evidence that quantifiable evolutionary code characteristics at a global system scope fail to take into account significant individual differences that exist at a subsystem level. We found that while there exist similarities in the code base growth rate and distribution of commit types (neutral, additive, and subtractive) across BSD subsystems, (a) most commits contain kernel or non-kernel code exclusively, (b) kernel commits are larger than non-kernel commits, and (c) code reviews for kernel code take longer than non-kernel code.

Our approach utilizes an abstracted representation of the model architecture and data, which allows unpolished prototype deep learning models to be trained without modification using the NVFlare federated learning framework. Our results show increases in prostate cancer detection and classification accuracy using a specialized neural network model and diverse prostate biopsy data collected at two University of California research hospitals, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach in adapting to different datasets and improving MR-biomarker discovery.

This human-dependent process is often time-consuming and prone to errors.

Continual adaptability and automation of neural networks is of paramount importance to several domains where model accessibility is limited after deployment (e.g IoT devices, self-driving vehicles, etc). Additionally, even accessible models require frequent maintenance post-deployment to overcome issues such as Concept/Data Drift, which can be cumbersome and restrictive. The current state of the art on adaptive ANNs is still a premature area of research; nevertheless, Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a form of AutoML, and Continual Learning (CL) have recently gained an increasing momentum in the Deep Learning research field, aiming to provide more robust and adaptive ANN development frameworks. This study is the first extensive review on the intersection between AutoML and CL, outlining research directions for the different methods that can facilitate full automation and lifelong plasticity in ANNs.

    "abstract": "Deep neural network (DNN) models have achieved state-of-the-art predictive accuracy in a wide range of supervised learning applications. However, accurately quantifying the uncertainty in DNN predictions remains a challenging task. For continuous outcome variables, an even more difficult problem is to estimate the predictive density function, which not only provides a natural quantification of the predictive uncertainty, but also fully captures the random variation in the outcome. In this work, we propose the Bayesian Deep Noise Neural Network (B-DeepNoise), which generalizes standard Bayesian DNNs by extending the random noise variable from the output layer to all hidden layers. The latent random noise equips B-DeepNoise with the flexibility to approximate highly complex predictive distributions and accurately quantify predictive uncertainty. For posterior computation, the unique structure of B-DeepNoise leads to a closed-form Gibbs sampling algorithm that iteratively simulates from the posterior full conditional distributions of the model parameters, circumventing computationally intensive Metropolis-Hastings methods. A theoretical analysis of B-DeepNoise establishes a recursive representation of the predictive distribution and decomposes the predictive variance with respect to the latent parameters. We evaluate B-DeepNoise against existing methods on benchmark regression datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in terms of prediction accuracy, uncertainty quantification accuracy, and uncertainty quantification efficiency. To illustrate our method's usefulness in scientific studies, we apply B-DeepNoise to predict general intelligence from neuroimaging features in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) project.

They are susceptible to the noises and may suffer from poor generalization ability in unseen scenarios. The second focuses on modeling noisy data directly, resulting in suboptimal performance due to the lack of regularity of these severe random noises.

A novel cycle loss is proposed to constrain the periodicity of physiological information.

A common approach employed by most previous works is to apply a layer that aggregates information from the historical neighbors of a node. Taking a different research direction, in this work, we propose tBDFS -- a novel temporal GNN architecture. tBDFS applies a layer that efficiently aggregates information from temporal paths to a given (target) node in the graph. For each given node, the aggregation is applied in two stages: (1) A single representation is learned for each temporal path ending in that node, and (2) all path representations are aggregated into a final node representation. Overall, our goal is not to add new information to a node, but rather observe the same exact information in a new perspective. This allows our model to directly observe patterns that are path-oriented rather than neighborhood-oriented. This can be thought as a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal over the temporal graph, compared to the popular Breath-First Search (BFS) traversal that is applied in previous works. We evaluate tBDFS over multiple link prediction tasks and show its favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply a temporal-DFS neural network. ",

    "abstract": "The study of electromagnetic detection satellite scheduling problem (EDSSP) has attracted attention due to the detection requirements for a large number of targets. This paper proposes a mixed-integer programming model for the EDSSP problem and an evolutionary algorithm framework based on reinforcement learning (RL-EA). Numerous factors that affect electromagnetic detection are considered in the model, such as detection mode, bandwidth, and other factors. The evolutionary algorithm framework based on reinforcement learning uses the Q-learning framework, and each individual in the population is regarded as an agent. Based on the proposed framework, a Q-learning-based genetic algorithm(QGA) is designed. Q-learning is used to guide the population search process by choosing variation operators. In the algorithm, we design a reward function to update the Q value. According to the problem characteristics, a new combination of <state, action> is proposed. The QGA also uses an elite individual retention strategy to improve search performance. After that, a task time window selection algorithm is proposed To evaluate the performance of population evolution. Various scales experiments are used to examine the planning effect of the proposed algorithm. Through the experimental verification of multiple instances, it can be seen that the QGA can solve the EDSSP problem effectively. Compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the QGA algorithm performs better in several aspects. ",

Current work on knowledge-grounded dialogue generation primarily focuses on persona incorporation or searching a fact-based structured knowledge source such as Wikipedia. Our method takes a broader and simpler approach, which aims to improve the raw conversation ability of the system by mimicking the human response behavior through casual interactions found on social media. Utilizing a joint retriever-generator setup, the model queries a large set of filtered comment data from Reddit to act as additional context for the seq2seq generator.

This paper focuses on the challenging task of initialization-free pose registration up to 7DoF for homogeneous and heterogeneous measurements. While recent learning-based methods show promise using differentiable solvers, they either rely on heuristically defined correspondences or are prone to local minima. We present a differentiable phase correlation (DPC) solver that is globally convergent and correspondence-free. When combined with simple feature extraction networks, our general framework DPCN++ allows for versatile pose registration with arbitrary initialization. Specifically, the feature extraction networks first learn dense feature grids from a pair of homogeneous/heterogeneous measurements. These feature grids are then transformed into a translation and scale invariant spectrum representation based on Fourier transform and spherical radial aggregation, decoupling translation and scale from rotation. Next, the rotation, scale, and translation are independently and efficiently estimated in the spectrum step-by-step using the DPC solver. The entire pipeline is differentiable and trained end-to-end. We evaluate DCPN++ on a wide range of registration tasks taking different input modalities, including 2D bird's-eye view images, 3D object and scene measurements, and medical images. Experimental results demonstrate that DCPN++ outperforms both classical and learning-based baselines, especially on partially observed and heterogeneous measurements. ",

Our model aims to forecast multiple paths based on a historical trajectory by modeling multi-scale graph-based spatial transformers combined with a trajectory smoothing algorithm named ``Memory Replay'' utilizing a memory graph. Our method can comprehensively exploit the spatial information as well as correct the temporally inconsistent trajectories (e.g., sharp turns). We also propose a new evaluation metric named ``Percentage of Trajectory Usage'' to evaluate the comprehensiveness of diverse multi-future predictions.

Due to imperfect Internet regulation, the spread of false rumors has become a common problem on those social platforms. Social platforms can generate rumor data in their operation process, but existing rumor detection models are all constructed for a single social platform, which ignores the value of cross-platform rumor. This paper combines the federated learning paradigm with the bidirectional graph attention network rumor detection model and proposes the federated graph attention network(FedGAT) model for rumor detection. Taking the advantages of horizontal federated learning for cross-platform rumor detection, the security of each social platform's data information can be ensured. We construct both the server-side and client-side models as a bidirectional graph attention network rumor detection model in the federated learning paradigm framework. The local model on the client-side can train and verify the rumor data of the social platform in the iterative process, while the model on the server-side only plays the role of aggregating the characteristics of different social platform models and does not participate in the training of the model. Finally, we conduct simulation experiments on the rumor datasets and the experimental results show that the federated graph attention network model proposed in this paper is effective for cross-platform rumor detection.

Next location prediction is one decisive task in individual human mobility modeling and is usually viewed as sequence modeling, solved with Markov or RNN-based methods. However, the existing models paid little attention to the logic of individual travel decisions and the reproducibility of the collective behavior of population. To this end, we propose a Causal and Spatial-constrained Long and Short-term Learner (CSLSL) for next location prediction. CSLSL utilizes a causal structure based on multi-task learning to explicitly model the \"when$\\rightarrow$what$\\rightarrow$where\", a.k.a. \"time$\\rightarrow$activity$\\rightarrow$location\" decision logic. We next propose a spatial-constrained loss function as an auxiliary task, to ensure the consistency between the predicted and actual spatial distribution of travelers' destinations. Moreover, CSLSL adopts modules named Long and Short-term Capturer (LSC) to learn the transition regularities across different time spans. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show a 33.4% performance improvement of CSLSL over baselines and confirm the effectiveness of introducing the causality and consistency constraints.

This task becomes more difficult when only sparse images are provided as input, a scenario where existing neural reconstruction approaches usually produce incomplete or distorted results. Moreover, their inability of generalizing to unseen new scenes impedes their application in practice. Contrarily, SparseNeuS can generalize to new scenes and work well with sparse images (as few as 2 or 3). SparseNeuS adopts signed distance function (SDF) as the surface representation, and learns generalizable priors from image features by introducing geometry encoding volumes for generic surface prediction. Moreover, several strategies are introduced to effectively leverage sparse views for high-quality reconstruction, including 1) a multi-level geometry reasoning framework to recover the surfaces in a coarse-to-fine manner; 2) a multi-scale color blending scheme for more reliable color prediction; 3) a consistency-aware fine-tuning scheme to control the inconsistent regions caused by occlusion and noise.

We present AURA, a multimodal fake news detection network with Adaptive Unimodal Representation Aggregation.

Then, we perform coarse-level fake news detection and cross-modal cosistency learning according to the unimodal and multimodal representations. The classification and consistency scores are mapped into modality-aware attention scores that readjust the features.

However, given the evolving sophistication of injection attacks and the increasing complexity of tuning a WAF, it is challenging to ensure that the WAF is free of injection vulnerabilities such that it will block all malicious injection attacks without wrongly affecting the legitimate message. Automatically testing the WAF is, therefore, a timely and essential task. In this paper, we propose DaNuoYi, an automatic injection testing tool that simultaneously generates test inputs for multiple types of injection attacks on a WAF. Our basic idea derives from the cross-lingual translation in the natural language processing domain. In particular, test inputs for different types of injection attacks are syntactically different but may be semantically similar. Sharing semantic knowledge across multiple programming languages can thus stimulate the generation of more sophisticated test inputs and discovering injection vulnerabilities of the WAF that are otherwise difficult to find. To this end, in DaNuoYi, we train several injection translation models by using multi-task learning that translates the test inputs between any pair of injection attacks. The model is then used by a novel multi-task evolutionary algorithm to co-evolve test inputs for different types of injection attacks facilitated by a shared mating pool and domain-specific mutation operators at each generation. We conduct experiments on three real-world open-source WAFs and six types of injection attacks, the results reveal that DaNuoYi generates up to 3.8x and 5.78x more valid test inputs (i.e., bypassing the underlying WAF) than its state-of-the-art single-task counterparts and the context-free grammar-based injection construction.

However, deep neural networks are vulnerable to malicious adversarial noises, which may potentially cause catastrophic failures in Embodied Vision Navigation. Among these adversarial noises, universal adversarial perturbations (UAP), i.e., the image-agnostic perturbation applied on each frame received by the agent, are more critical for Embodied Vision Navigation since they are computation-efficient and application-practical during the attack. However, existing UAP methods do not consider the system dynamics of Embodied Vision Navigation. For extending UAP in the sequential decision setting, we formulate the disturbed environment under the universal noise $\\delta$, as a $\\delta$-disturbed Markov Decision Process ($\\delta$-MDP). Based on the formulation, we analyze the properties of $\\delta$-MDP and propose two novel Consistent Attack methods for attacking Embodied agents, which first consider the dynamic of the MDP by estimating the disturbed Q function and the disturbed distribution. In spite of victim models, our Consistent Attack can cause a significant drop in the performance for the Goalpoint task in habitat. Extensive experimental results indicate that there exist potential risks for applying Embodied Vision Navigation methods to the real world. ",

Previous works in domain adaptation object detection attempt to align image-level and instance-level shifts to eventually minimize the domain discrepancy, but they may align single-class features to mixed-class features in image-level domain adaptation because each image in the object detection task may be more than one class and object. In order to achieve single-class with single-class alignment and mixed-class with mixed-class alignment, we treat the mixed-class of the feature as a new class and propose a mixed-classes $H-divergence$ for object detection to achieve homogenous feature alignment and reduce negative transfer. Then, a Semantic Consistency Feature Alignment Model (SCFAM) based on mixed-classes $H-divergence$ was also presented. To improve single-class and mixed-class semantic information and accomplish semantic separation, the SCFAM model proposes Semantic Prediction Models (SPM) and Semantic Bridging Components (SBC). And the weight of the pix domain discriminator loss is then changed based on the SPM result to reduce sample imbalance.

We propose Omnidirectional Distance Fields (ODFs), a new 3D shape representation that encodes geometry by storing the depth to the object's surface from any 3D position in any viewing direction. Since rays are the fundamental unit of an ODF, it can be used to easily transform to and from common 3D representations like meshes or point clouds. Different from level set methods that are limited to representing closed surfaces, ODFs are unsigned and can thus model open surfaces (e.g., garments). We demonstrate that ODFs can be effectively learned with a neural network (NeuralODF) despite the inherent discontinuities at occlusion boundaries. We also introduce efficient forward mapping algorithms for transforming ODFs to and from common 3D representations. Specifically, we introduce an efficient Jumping Cubes algorithm for generating meshes from ODFs. Experiments demonstrate that NeuralODF can learn to capture high-quality shape by overfitting to a single object, and also learn to generalize on common shape categories. ",

Therefore, it is very important to implement a robust and effective method to detect such frauds. The machine learning algorithms are appropriate for these tasks since they try to maximize the accuracy of predictions and hence can be relied upon. However, there is an impending flaw where in machine learning models may not perform well due to the presence of an imbalance across classes distribution within the sample set. So, in many related tasks, the datasets have a very small number of observed fraud cases (sometimes around 1 percent positive fraud instances found). Therefore, this imbalance presence may impact any learning model's behavior by predicting all labels as the majority class, hence allowing no scope for generalization in the predictions made by the model. We trained Generative Adversarial Network(GAN) to generate a large number of convincing (and reliable) synthetic examples of the minority class that can be used to alleviate the class imbalance within the training set and hence generalize the learning of the data more effectively.

It can be attributed to the prior knowledge or the high-level cognitive inductive bias present in the brain. Therefore, introducing meaningful inductive bias to neural networks can help learn more generic and high-level representations and alleviate some of the shortcomings. We propose InBiaseD to distill inductive bias and bring shape-awareness to the neural networks. Our method includes a bias alignment objective that enforces the networks to learn more generic representations that are less vulnerable to unintended cues in the data which results in improved generalization performance. InBiaseD is less susceptible to shortcut learning and also exhibits lower texture bias. The better representations also aid in improving robustness to adversarial attacks and we hence plugin InBiaseD seamlessly into the existing adversarial training schemes to show a better trade-off between generalization and robustness.

However, most existing neural attention models admit only short sequences, or they have to employ chunking or padding to enforce a constant input length. Here we propose a simple neural network building block called ChordMixer which can model the attention for long sequences with variable lengths. Each ChordMixer block consists of a position-wise rotation layer without learnable parameters and an element-wise MLP layer. Repeatedly applying such blocks forms an effective network backbone that mixes the input signals towards the learning targets. We have tested ChordMixer on the synthetic adding problem, long document classification, and DNA sequence-based taxonomy classification. The experiment results show that our method substantially outperforms other neural attention models. ",

    "abstract": "This work introduces Directed-Evolution (DE) method for sparsification of neural networks, where the relevance of parameters to the network accuracy is directly assessed and the parameters that produce the least effect on accuracy when tentatively zeroed are indeed zeroed. DE method avoids a potentially combinatorial explosion of all possible candidate sets of parameters to be zeroed in large networks by mimicking evolution in the natural world. DE uses a distillation context [5]. In this context, the original network is the teacher and DE evolves the student neural network to the sparsification goal while maintaining minimal divergence between teacher and student. After the desired sparsification level is reached in each layer of the network by DE, a variety of quantization alternatives are used on the surviving parameters to find the lowest number of bits for their representation with acceptable loss of accuracy. A procedure to find optimal distribution of quantization levels in each sparsified layer is presented. Suitable final lossless encoding of the surviving quantized parameters is used for the final parameter representation. DE was used in sample of representative neural networks using MNIST, FashionMNIST and COCO data sets with progressive larger networks. An 80 classes YOLOv3 with more than 60 million parameters network trained on COCO dataset reached 90% sparsification and correctly identifies and segments all objects identified by the original network with more than 80% confidence using 4bit parameter quantization. Compression between 40x and 80x. It has not escaped the authors that techniques from different methods can be nested. Once the best parameter set for sparsification is identified in a cycle of DE, a decision on zeroing only a sub-set of those parameters can be made using a combination of criteria like parameter magnitude and Hessian approximations.

To deal with the ambiguity, most existing studies resort to additional constraint information or implicit inference by analyzing two-view geometries or feature points. In this paper, we propose to exploit high-level information in the scene, i.e., the spatial contextual information of local regions, to guide the reconstruction. Specifically, a novel structure is proposed, namely, {\\textit{track-community}}, in which each community consists of a group of tracks and represents a local segment in the scene. A community detection algorithm is used to partition the scene into several segments. Then, the potential ambiguous segments are detected by analyzing the neighborhood of tracks and corrected by checking the pose consistency. Finally, we perform partial reconstruction on each segment and align them with a novel bidirectional consistency cost function which considers both 3D-3D correspondences and pairwise relative camera poses. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can robustly alleviate reconstruction failure resulting from visually indistinguishable structures and accurately merge the partial reconstructions.

In the field of online service systems, operators rely on enormous monitoring data to detect and mitigate failures. Quickly recognizing a small set of root cause indicators for the underlying fault can save much time for failure mitigation. In this paper, we formulate the root cause analysis problem as a new causal inference task named intervention recognition. We proposed a novel unsupervised causal inference-based method named Causal Inference-based Root Cause Analysis (CIRCA). The core idea is a sufficient condition for a monitoring variable to be a root cause indicator, i.e., the change of probability distribution conditioned on the parents in the Causal Bayesian Network (CBN). Towards the application in online service systems, CIRCA constructs a graph among monitoring metrics based on the knowledge of system architecture and a set of causal assumptions. The simulation study illustrates the theoretical reliability of CIRCA. The performance on a real-world dataset further shows that CIRCA can improve the recall of the top-1 recommendation by 25% over the best baseline method. ",

Because domain shifts can change the acoustic characteristics of data, a model trained in a source domain performs poorly for a target domain. In DCASE 2021 Challenge Task 2, we organized an ASD task for handling domain shifts. In this task, it was assumed that the occurrences of domain shifts are known. However, in practice, the domain of each sample may not be given, and the domain shifts can occur implicitly. In 2022 Task 2, we focus on domain generalization techniques that detects anomalies regardless of the domain shifts. Specifically, the domain of each sample is not given in the test data and only one threshold is allowed for all domains.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) represents a promising distributed machine learning paradigm that allows smart devices to collaboratively train a shared model via providing local data sets. However, problems considering multiple co-existing FL services and different types of service providers are rarely studied. In this paper, we investigate a multiple FL service trading problem in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-aided networks, where FL service demanders (FLSDs) aim to purchase various data sets from feasible clients (smart devices, e.g., smartphones, smart vehicles), and model aggregation services from UAVs, to fulfill their requirements. An auction-based trading market is established to facilitate the trading among three parties, i.e., FLSDs acting as buyers, distributed located client groups acting as data-sellers, and UAVs acting as UAV-sellers. The proposed auction is formalized as a 0-1 integer programming problem, aiming to maximize the overall buyers' revenue via investigating winner determination and payment rule design. Specifically, since two seller types (data-sellers and UAV-sellers) are considered, an interesting idea integrating seller pair and joint bid is introduced, which turns diverse sellers into virtual seller pairs. Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)-based, and one-sided matching-based mechanisms are proposed, respectively, where the former achieves the optimal solutions, which, however, is computationally intractable. While the latter can obtain suboptimal solutions that approach to the optimal ones, with low computational complexity, especially upon considering a large number of participants. Significant properties such as truthfulness and individual rationality are comprehensively analyzed for both mechanisms. Extensive experimental results verify the properties and demonstrate that our proposed mechanisms outperform representative methods significantly. ",

In herding problems, the motion of the evaders is typically determined by strongly nonlinear and heterogeneous reactive dynamics, which makes the development of flexible control solutions a challenging problem. In this context, we propose Implicit Control, an approach that leverages numerical analysis theory to find suitable herding inputs even when the nonlinearities in the evaders' dynamics yield to implicit equations. The intuition behind this methodology consists in driving the input, rather than computing it, towards the unknown value that achieves the desired dynamic behavior of the herd. The same idea is exploited to develop an adaptation law, with stability guarantees, that copes with uncertainties in the herd's models. Moreover, our solution is completed with a novel caging technique based on uncertainty models and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), together with a distributed estimator to overcome the need of complete perfect measurements. Different simulations and experiments validate the generality and flexibility of the proposal. ",

Initial features of local users and contents are generated by incorporating neighbor information with self information. Then, dual-channel neural network (DCNN) model is introduced to learn the hidden representations by producing deep latent features from initial features. For mobile users, the content popularity is predicted via user preference learning. In order to distinguish regional variations of content popularity, clustered federated learning (CFL) is employed, which enables fog access points (F-APs) with similar regional types to benefit from one another and provides a more specialized DCNN model for each F-AP.

    "abstract": "As representation learning becomes a powerful technique to reduce sample complexity in reinforcement learning (RL) in practice, theoretical understanding of its advantage is still limited. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the benefit of representation learning under the low-rank Markov decision process (MDP) model. We first study multitask low-rank RL (as upstream training), where all tasks share a common representation, and propose a new multitask reward-free algorithm called REFUEL. REFUEL learns both the transition kernel and the near-optimal policy for each task, and outputs a well-learned representation for downstream tasks. Our result demonstrates that multitask representation learning is provably more sample-efficient than learning each task individually, as long as the total number of tasks is above a certain threshold. We then study the downstream RL in both online and offline settings, where the agent is assigned with a new task sharing the same representation as the upstream tasks. For both online and offline settings, we develop a sample-efficient algorithm, and show that it finds a near-optimal policy with the suboptimality gap bounded by the sum of the estimation error of the learned representation in upstream and a vanishing term as the number of downstream samples becomes large. Our downstream results of online and offline RL further capture the benefit of employing the learned representation from upstream as opposed to learning the representation of the low-rank model directly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical study that characterizes the benefit of representation learning in exploration-based reward-free multitask RL for both upstream and downstream tasks.

Moreover, there has been folklore that quantization acts as an implicit regularizer and thus can improve the generalizability of neural networks, yet no existing work formalizes this interesting folklore. In this paper, we take the binary weights in a neural network as random variables under stochastic rounding, and study the distribution propagation over different layers in the neural network. We propose a quasi neural network to approximate the distribution propagation, which is a neural network with continuous parameters and smooth activation function. We derive the neural tangent kernel (NTK) for this quasi neural network, and show that the eigenvalue of NTK decays at approximately exponential rate, which is comparable to that of Gaussian kernel with randomized scale. This in turn indicates that the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) of a binary weight neural network covers a strict subset of functions compared with the one with real value weights. We use experiments to verify that the quasi neural network we proposed can well approximate binary weight neural network. Furthermore, binary weight neural network gives a lower generalization gap compared with real value weight neural network, which is similar to the difference between Gaussian kernel and Laplace kernel.

    "abstract": "Feature extraction and matching are the basic parts of many computer vision tasks, such as 2D or 3D object detection, recognition, and registration. As we all know, 2D feature extraction and matching have already been achieved great success. Unfortunately, in the field of 3D, the current methods fail to support the extensive application of 3D LiDAR sensors in vision tasks, due to the poor descriptiveness and inefficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a novel 3D feature representation method: Linear Keypoints representation for 3D LiDAR point cloud, called LinK3D. The novelty of LinK3D lies in that it fully considers the characteristics (such as sparsity, complexity of scenarios) of LiDAR point cloud, and represents current keypoint with its robust neighbor keypoints, which provide strong constraint on the description of current keypoint. The proposed LinK3D has been evaluated on two public datasets (i.e., KITTI, Steven VLP16), and the experimental results show that our method greatly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in matching performance. More importantly, LinK3D shows excellent real-time performance (based on the frequence 10 Hz of LiDAR). LinK3D only takes an average of 32 milliseconds to extract features from the point cloud collected by a 64-ray laser beam, and takes merely about 8 milliseconds to match two LiDAR scans when executed in a notebook with an Intel Core i7 @2.2 GHz processor. Moreover, our method can be widely extended to a variety of 3D vision applications. In this paper, we has applied our LinK3D to 3D registration, LiDAR odometry and place recognition tasks, and achieved competitive results compared with the state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Anomalous sound detection systems must detect unknown, atypical sounds using only normal audio data. Conventional methods use the serial method, a combination of outlier exposure (OE), which classifies normal and pseudo-anomalous data and obtains embedding, and inlier modeling (IM), which models the probability distribution of the embedding. Although the serial method shows high performance due to the powerful feature extraction of OE and the robustness of IM, OE still has a problem that doesn't work well when the normal and pseudo-anomalous data are too similar or too different. To explicitly distinguish these data, the proposed method uses multi-task learning of two binary cross-entropies when training OE. The first is a loss that classifies the sound of the target machine to which product it is emitted from, which deals with the case where the normal data and the pseudo-anomalous data are too similar. The second is a loss that identifies whether the sound is emitted from the target machine or not, which deals with the case where the normal data and the pseudo-anomalous data are too different. We perform our experiments with DCASE 2021 Task~2 dataset. Our proposed single-model method outperforms the top-ranked method, which combines multiple models, by 2.1% in AUC. ",

    "abstract": "In order to develop effective sequential recommenders, a series of sequence representation learning (SRL) methods are proposed to model historical user behaviors. Most existing SRL methods rely on explicit item IDs for developing the sequence models to better capture user preference. Though effective to some extent, these methods are difficult to be transferred to new recommendation scenarios, due to the limitation by explicitly modeling item IDs. To tackle this issue, we present a novel universal sequence representation learning approach, named UniSRec. The proposed approach utilizes the associated description text of items to learn transferable representations across different recommendation scenarios. For learning universal item representations, we design a lightweight item encoding architecture based on parametric whitening and mixture-of-experts enhanced adaptor. For learning universal sequence representations, we introduce two contrastive pre-training tasks by sampling multi-domain negatives. With the pre-trained universal sequence representation model, our approach can be effectively transferred to new recommendation domains or platforms in a parameter-efficient way, under either inductive or transductive settings. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Especially, our approach also leads to a performance improvement in a cross-platform setting, showing the strong transferability of the proposed universal SRL method.

Driven by the recent technical developments in optimization and generalization of DNNs, learning a neural ranking model online from its interactions with users becomes possible. However, the required exploration for model learning has to be performed in the entire neural network parameter space, which is prohibitively expensive and limits the application of such online solutions in practice. In this work, we propose an efficient exploration strategy for online interactive neural ranker learning based on the idea of bootstrapping. Our solution employs an ensemble of ranking models trained with perturbed user click feedback. The proposed method eliminates explicit confidence set construction and the associated computational overhead, which enables the online neural rankers' training to be efficiently executed in practice with theoretical guarantees.

For a given set of customers to serve, the playing agents (vehicles) have the common goal to determine the team-optimal agent routes with minimal total cost. Each agent thereby observes only its own cost. Our multi-agent reinforcement learning approach, the so-called multi-agent Neural Rewriter, builds on the single-agent Neural Rewriter to solve the problem by iteratively rewriting solutions. Parallel agent action execution and partial observability require new rewriting rules for the game. We propose the introduction of a so-called pool in the system which serves as a collection point for unvisited nodes. It enables agents to act simultaneously and exchange nodes in a conflict-free manner. We realize limited disclosure of agent-specific costs by only sharing them during learning. During inference, each agents acts decentrally, solely based on its own cost. First empirical results on small problem sizes demonstrate that we reach a performance close to the employed OR-Tools benchmark which operates in the perfect cost information setting. ",

DNNs that satisfy these assumptions are referred to as general DNNs. Our construction of an analytic graph was based on an axiomatic method in which DAGs are built from the bottom-up through the application of atomic operations to basic elements in accordance with regulatory rules. This approach allows us to derive the properties of general DNNs via mathematical induction. We show that using the proposed approach, some properties hold true for general DNNs can be derived.

    "abstract": "Watch-time prediction remains to be a key factor in reinforcing user engagement via video recommendations. It has become increasingly important given the ever-growing popularity of online videos. However, prediction of watch time not only depends on the match between the user and the video but is often mislead by the duration of the video itself. With the goal of improving watch time, recommendation is always biased towards videos with long duration. Models trained on this imbalanced data face the risk of bias amplification, which misguides platforms to over-recommend videos with long duration but overlook the underlying user interests. This paper presents the first work to study duration bias in watch-time prediction for video recommendation. We employ a causal graph illuminating that duration is a confounding factor that concurrently affects video exposure and watch-time prediction -- the first effect on video causes the bias issue and should be eliminated, while the second effect on watch time originates from video intrinsic characteristics and should be preserved. To remove the undesired bias but leverage the natural effect, we propose a Duration Deconfounded Quantile-based (D2Q) watch-time prediction framework, which allows for scalability to perform on industry production systems. Through extensive offline evaluation and live experiments, we showcase the effectiveness of this duration-deconfounding framework by significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art baselines. We have fully launched our approach on Kuaishou App, which has substantially improved real-time video consumption due to more accurate watch-time predictions. ",

We design a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning approach to solve the charging station placement problem (PCRL). Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show how the PCRL reduces the waiting and travel time while increasing the benefit of the charging plan compared to five baselines.

The current paradigm in the SSL is to utilize data augmentation at the input space to create different views of the same images and train a model to maximize the representations between similar images and minimize them for different ones. While this approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in various downstream tasks, it still lakes the opportunity to investigate the latent space augmentation. This paper proposes TriMix, a novel concept for SSL that generates virtual embeddings through linear interpolation of the data, thus providing the model with novel representations. Our strategy focuses on training the model to extract the original embeddings from virtual ones, hence, better representation learning. Additionally, we propose a self-consistency term that improves the consistency between the virtual and actual embeddings. We validate TriMix on eight benchmark datasets consisting of natural and medical images with an improvement of 2.71% and 0.41% better than the second-best models for both data types. Further, our approach outperformed the current methods in semi-supervised learning, particularly in low data regimes. Besides, our pre-trained models showed better transfer to other datasets. ",

In particular, the assumption of low-rank feature representations leads to algorithmic developments in many architectures.

To fill this gap, we perform a rigorous study on the behavior of network rank, focusing particularly on the notion of rank deficiency. We theoretically establish a universal monotonic decreasing property of network rank from the basic rules of differential and algebraic composition, and uncover rank deficiency of network blocks and deep function coupling. By virtue of our numerical tools, we provide the first empirical analysis of the per-layer behavior of network rank in practical settings, i.e., ResNets, deep MLPs, and Transformers on ImageNet. These empirical results are in direct accord with our theory. Furthermore, we reveal a novel phenomenon of independence deficit caused by the rank deficiency of deep networks, where classification confidence of a given category can be linearly decided by the confidence of a handful of other categories. The theoretical results of this work, together with the empirical findings, may advance understanding of the inherent principles of deep neural networks. ",

    "abstract": "Fully unsupervised 3D representation learning has gained attention owing to its advantages in data collection. A successful approach involves a viewpoint-aware approach that learns an image distribution based on generative models (e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs)) while generating various view images based on 3D-aware models (e.g., neural radiance fields (NeRFs)). However, they require images with various views for training, and consequently, their application to datasets with few or limited viewpoints remains a challenge. As a complementary approach, an aperture rendering GAN (AR-GAN) that employs a defocus cue was proposed. However, an AR-GAN is a CNN-based model and represents a defocus independently from a viewpoint change despite its high correlation, which is one of the reasons for its performance. As an alternative to an AR-GAN, we propose an aperture rendering NeRF (AR-NeRF), which can utilize viewpoint and defocus cues in a unified manner by representing both factors in a common ray-tracing framework. Moreover, to learn defocus-aware and defocus-independent representations in a disentangled manner, we propose aperture randomized training, for which we learn to generate images while randomizing the aperture size and latent codes independently. During our experiments, we applied AR-NeRF to various natural image datasets, including flower, bird, and face images, the results of which demonstrate the utility of AR-NeRF for unsupervised learning of the depth and defocus effects.

    "abstract": "Vision-based perception tasks fulfill a paramount role in robotics, facilitating solutions to many challenging scenarios, such as acrobatics maneuvers of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and robot-assisted high precision surgery. Most control-oriented and egocentric perception problems are commonly solved by taking advantage of the robot state estimation as an auxiliary input, particularly when artificial intelligence comes into the picture. In this work, we propose to apply a similar approach for the first time - to the best of our knowledge - to allocentric perception tasks, where the target variables refer to an external subject. We prove how our general and intuitive methodology improves the regression performance of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with ambiguous problems such as the allocentric 3D pose estimation. By analyzing three highly-different use cases, spanning from grasping with a robotic arm to following a human subject with a pocket-sized UAV, our results consistently improve the R2 metric up to +0.514 compared to their stateless baselines. Finally, we validate the in-field performance of a closed-loop autonomous pocket-sized UAV in the human pose estimation task. Our results show a significant reduction, i.e., 24% on average, on the mean absolute error of our stateful CNN. ",

    "abstract": "Hawkes processes are a special class of temporal point processes which exhibit a natural notion of causality, as occurrence of events in the past may increase the probability of events in the future. Discovery of the underlying influence network among the dimensions of multi-dimensional temporal processes is of high importance in disciplines where a high-frequency data is to model, e.g. in financial data or in seismological data. This paper approaches the problem of learning Granger-causal network in multi-dimensional Hawkes processes. We formulate this problem as a model selection task in which we follow the minimum description length (MDL) principle. Moreover, we propose a general algorithm for MDL-based inference using a Monte-Carlo method and we use it for our causal discovery problem. We compare our algorithm with the state-of-the-art baseline methods on synthetic and real-world financial data. The synthetic experiments demonstrate superiority of our method incausal graph discovery compared to the baseline methods with respect to the size of the data. The results of experiments with the G-7 bonds price data are consistent with the experts knowledge. ",

In this paper, we propose to apply a deep learning denoising model inspired by a signal processing, a learnable version of wavelet packet transform. The proposed algorithm has signficant learning capabilities with few interpretable parameters and has an intuitive initialisation. We propose a post-learning modification of the parameters to adapt the denoising to different noise levels. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology on two case studies and compare it to other state of the art approaches, including wavelet schrinkage denoising, convolutional neural network, autoencoder and U-net deep models. The first case study is based on designed functions that have typically been used to study denoising properties of the algorithms. The second case study is an audio background removal task. We demonstrate how the proposed algorithm relates to the universality of signal processing methods and the learning capabilities of deep learning approaches. In particular, we evaluate the obtained denoising performances on structured noisy signals inside and outside the classes used for training. In addition to having good performance in denoising signals inside and outside to the training class, our method shows to be particularly robust when different noise levels, noise types and artifacts are added.

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have demonstrated excellent capabilities in various intelligent scenarios. Most existing methods for training SNNs are based on the concept of synaptic plasticity; however, learning in the realistic brain also utilizes intrinsic non-synaptic mechanisms of neurons. The spike threshold of biological neurons is a critical intrinsic neuronal feature that exhibits rich dynamics on a millisecond timescale and has been proposed as an underlying mechanism that facilitates neural information processing. In this study, we develop a novel synergistic learning approach that simultaneously trains synaptic weights and spike thresholds in SNNs. SNNs trained with synapse-threshold synergistic learning (STL-SNNs) achieve significantly higher accuracies on various static and neuromorphic datasets than SNNs trained with two single-learning models of the synaptic learning (SL) and the threshold learning (TL). During training, the synergistic learning approach optimizes neural thresholds, providing the network with stable signal transmission via appropriate firing rates. Further analysis indicates that STL-SNNs are robust to noisy data and exhibit low energy consumption for deep network structures. Additionally, the performance of STL-SNN can be further improved by introducing a generalized joint decision framework (JDF). Overall, our findings indicate that biologically plausible synergies between synaptic and intrinsic non-synaptic mechanisms may provide a promising approach for developing highly efficient SNN learning methods.

It allows for determining different groups of designs with similar properties and provides useful knowledge in the engineering decision making process. Also, it opens the route for further refinements of specific design candidates which exhibit certain characteristic features. In this work, an approach to define meaningful and consistent concepts in an existing engineering dataset is presented. The designs in the dataset are characterized by a multitude of features such as design parameters, geometrical properties or performance values of the design for various boundary conditions. In the proposed approach the complete feature set is partitioned into several subsets called description spaces. The definition of the concepts respects this partitioning which leads to several desired properties of the identified concepts, which cannot be achieved with state-of-the-art clustering or concept identification approaches. A novel concept quality measure is proposed, which provides an objective value for a given definition of concepts in a dataset. The usefulness of the measure is demonstrated by considering a realistic engineering dataset consisting of about 2500 airfoil profiles where the performance values (lift and drag) for three different operating conditions were obtained by a computational fluid dynamics simulation. A numerical optimization procedure is employed which maximizes the concept quality measure, and finds meaningful concepts for different setups of the description spaces while also incorporating user preference. It is demonstrated how these concepts can be used to select archetypal representatives of the dataset which exhibit characteristic features of each concept. ",

Recent work has shown that one can reconstruct the causal variables from temporal sequences of observations under the assumption that there are no instantaneous causal relations between them. In practical applications, however, our measurement or frame rate might be slower than many of the causal effects. This effectively creates \"instantaneous\" effects and invalidates previous identifiability results. To address this issue, we propose iCITRIS, a causal representation learning method that can handle instantaneous effects in temporal sequences when given perfect interventions with known intervention targets. iCITRIS identifies the causal factors from temporal observations, while simultaneously using a differentiable causal discovery method to learn their causal graph. In experiments on three video datasets, iCITRIS accurately identifies the causal factors and their causal graph. ",

Such dependencies make these solutions fundamentally impractical considering the possible adversities of outdoor environment as well as requirement of correlated wide-area operation. For practical use, apart from being technically sound and accurate, a solution has to be lightweight, cost-effective, easy-to-install, flexible as well as supporting efficient time-correlated coverage over large area. In this work we propose an IoT-assisted strategy to fulfil all these goals together. We adopt a top-down approach where we first introduce a lightweight framework for time-correlated low-cost wide-area measurement and then reuse the concept for developing the individual measurement units. Our extensive outdoor measurement studies and trace-based simulation on the empirical data show about 98% accuracy in vehicle detection and upto 93% of accuracy in classification of the vehicles over moderately busy urban roads.

However, existing DNN-based LF image SR methods are developed on a single fixed degradation (e.g., bicubic downsampling), and thus cannot be applied to super-resolve real LF images with diverse degradations. In this paper, we propose the first method to handle LF image SR with multiple degradations. In our method, a practical LF degradation model that considers blur and noise is developed to approximate the degradation process of real LF images. Then, a degradation-adaptive network (LF-DAnet) is designed to incorporate the degradation prior into the SR process. By training on LF images with multiple synthetic degradations, our method can learn to adapt to different degradations while incorporating the spatial and angular information. Extensive experiments on both synthetically degraded and real-world LFs demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with existing state-of-the-art single and LF image SR methods, our method achieves superior SR performance under a wide range of degradations, and generalizes better to real LF images.

While effective, it remains unclear whether it can successfully be adapted to the distributed learning context. The power of distributed optimization over multiple machines enables us to scale up robust training over large models and datasets.

This has led to new insights for improving privacy-label design and compliance requirements, so app developers, platform stakeholders, and policy-makers can better achieve their privacy and accountability goals.

    "abstract": "Recent high-performing Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection techniques have been highly influenced by Transformer-based object detector (i.e., DETR). Nevertheless, most of them directly map parametric interaction queries into a set of HOI predictions through vanilla Transformer in a one-stage manner. This leaves rich inter- or intra-interaction structure under-exploited. In this work, we design a novel Transformer-style HOI detector, i.e., Structure-aware Transformer over Interaction Proposals (STIP), for HOI detection. Such design decomposes the process of HOI set prediction into two subsequent phases, i.e., an interaction proposal generation is first performed, and then followed by transforming the non-parametric interaction proposals into HOI predictions via a structure-aware Transformer. The structure-aware Transformer upgrades vanilla Transformer by encoding additionally the holistically semantic structure among interaction proposals as well as the locally spatial structure of human/object within each interaction proposal, so as to strengthen HOI predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on V-COCO and HICO-DET benchmarks have demonstrated the effectiveness of STIP, and superior results are reported when comparing with the state-of-the-art HOI detectors.

    "abstract": "Self-training for unsupervised domain adaptive object detection is a challenging task, of which the performance depends heavily on the quality of pseudo boxes. Despite the promising results, prior works have largely overlooked the uncertainty of pseudo boxes during self-training. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective framework, termed as Probabilistic Teacher (PT), which aims to capture the uncertainty of unlabeled target data from a gradually evolving teacher and guides the learning of a student in a mutually beneficial manner. Specifically, we propose to leverage the uncertainty-guided consistency training to promote classification adaptation and localization adaptation, rather than filtering pseudo boxes via an elaborate confidence threshold. In addition, we conduct anchor adaptation in parallel with localization adaptation, since anchor can be regarded as a learnable parameter. Together with this framework, we also present a novel Entropy Focal Loss (EFL) to further facilitate the uncertainty-guided self-training. Equipped with EFL, PT outperforms all previous baselines by a large margin and achieve new state-of-the-arts. ",

We introduce two novel tools to help working on calculi using the approach of graph theory and automata theory. The first tool is a Proof Tree Automaton (PTA): a tree automaton which language is the derivation language of a calculus. The second tool is a graphical representation of a calculus called Proof Tree Graph (PTG). In this directed hypergraph, vertices are sets of terms (e.g. sequents) and hyperarcs are rules. We explore properties of PTA and PTGs and how they relate to each other. We show that we can decompose a PTA as a partial map from a calculus to a traditional tree automaton. We formulate that statement in the theory of refinement systems. Finally, we compare our framework to proof nets and string diagrams. ",

One of the fundamental concepts of EC is to push the data processing near the edge by exploiting front-end devices with powerful computation capabilities. Thus, limiting the use of centralized architecture, such as cloud computing, to only when it is necessary. This paper proposes a novel edge computer offloading technique that assigns computational tasks generated by devices to potential edge computers with enough computational resources. The proposed approach clusters the edge computers based on their hardware specifications. Afterwards, the tasks generated by devices will be fed to a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that predicts, based on these tasks, the profiles, i.e., features, of the edge computers with enough computational resources to execute them. The predicted edge computers are then assigned to the cluster they belong to so that each task is assigned to a cluster of edge computers. Finally, we choose for each task the edge computer that is expected to provide the fastest response time. The experiment results show that our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art machine learning approaches using real-world IoT dataset. ",

Then the transcriptionist prepares a preliminary formatted report referring to the notes, and finally, the radiologist reviews the report, corrects the errors, and signs off.

In current research work, we focus on applications of NLP techniques like Information Extraction (IE) and domain-specific Knowledge Graph (KG) to automatically generate radiology reports from radiologist's dictation. This paper focuses on KG construction for each organ by extracting information from an existing large corpus of free-text radiology reports. We develop an information extraction pipeline that combines rule-based, pattern-based, and dictionary-based techniques with lexical-semantic features to extract entities and relations. Missing information in short dictation can be accessed from the KGs to generate pathological descriptions and hence the radiology report. Generated pathological descriptions evaluated using semantic similarity metrics, which shows 97% similarity with gold standard pathological descriptions. Also, our analysis shows that our IE module is performing better than the OpenIE tool for the radiology domain. Furthermore, we include a manual qualitative analysis from radiologists, which shows that 80-85% of the generated reports are correctly written, and the remaining are partially correct. ",

We distinguish two types of learnable uncertainty: model uncertainty due to a lack of training data and noise-induced observational uncertainty. Bayesian neural networks use solid mathematical foundations to learn the model uncertainties of their predictions. The observational uncertainty can be calculated by adding one layer to these networks and augmenting their loss functions. Our contribution is to apply these uncertainty concepts to predictive process monitoring tasks to train uncertainty-based models to predict the remaining time and outcomes. Our experiments show that uncertainty estimates allow more and less accurate predictions to be differentiated and confidence intervals to be constructed in both regression and classification tasks. These conclusions remain true even in early stages of running processes. Moreover, the deployed techniques are fast and produce more accurate predictions. The learned uncertainty could increase users' confidence in their process prediction systems, promote better cooperation between humans and these systems, and enable earlier implementations with smaller datasets.

Each individual plays a coordination game with its neighbors and decides what alternative product to adopt to maximize its payoff. As products are used in conjunction with others and through repeated interactions, individuals are more interested in their long-term benefits and tend to show trustworthiness to others to maximize their long-term payoffs. To capture such trustworthy behavior, we deviate from the expected utility theory and use a new notion of rationality based on limited-trust equilibrium (LTE). By incorporating such notion into the diffusion model, we analyze the convergence of emerging dynamics to their equilibrium points using a mean-field approximation. We study the equilibrium state and the convergence rate of the diffusion process using the absorption probability and the expected absorption time of a reduced-size absorbing Markov chain. We also show that the LTE diffusion model under the best-response strategy can be converted to the well-known linear threshold model. Simulations show that when agents behave trustworthily, their long-term payoffs will increase significantly compared to the case when they are solely self-interested. Moreover, the Markov chain analysis provides a good estimation of the convergence property over random networks. ",

The convolution operation however has a significant weakness which is it only operates on a local neighborhood of pixels, thus it misses global information of the surrounding neighbors. Transformers, or Self-attention networks to be more specific, on the other hand, have emerged as a recent advance to capture long range interactions of the input, but they have mostly been applied to sequence modeling tasks such as Neural Machine Translation, Image captioning and other Natural Language Processing tasks. Transformers has been applied to natural language related tasks and achieved promising results. However, its applications in visual related tasks are far from being satisfying. Taking into consideration of both the weaknesses of Convolutional Neural Networks and those of the Transformers, in this paper, we consider the use of self-attention for discriminative visual tasks, object detection, as an alternative to convolutions. In this paper, we propose our model: DetTransNet. Extensive experiments show that our model leads to consistent improvements in object detection on COCO across many different models and scales, including ResNets, while keeping the number of parameters similar. In particular, our method achieves a 1.2% Average Precision improvement on COCO object detection task over other baseline models. ",

We build on the strengths of recent advances in neural reconstruction and rendering such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). A major shortcoming of such approaches is that they fail to reconstruct any part of the object which is not clearly visible in the training image, which is often the case for in-the-wild images and videos. When evidence is lacking, structural priors such as symmetry can be used to complete the missing information. However, exploiting such priors in neural rendering is highly non-trivial: while geometry and non-reflective materials may be symmetric, shadows and reflections from the ambient scene are not symmetric in general. To address this, we apply a soft symmetry constraint to the 3D geometry and material properties, having factored appearance into lighting, albedo colour and reflectivity. We evaluate our method on the recently introduced CO3D dataset, focusing on the car category due to the challenge of reconstructing highly-reflective materials. We show that it can reconstruct unobserved regions with high fidelity and render high-quality novel view images. ",

Specifically, given an integer k and a query vertex u, then we search for the subgraph H which satisfies (i) u $\\in$ H; (ii) the de-temporal graph of H is a connected k-core; (iii) In H that u has the maximum engagement level. To address our problem, we first develop a top-down greedy peeling algorithm named TDGP, which iteratively removes the vertices with the maximum temporal degree. To boost the efficiency, we then design a bottom-up local search algorithm named BULS and its enhanced versions BULS and BULS. Lastly, we empirically show the superiority of our proposed solutions on six real-world temporal graphs. ",

In many cases, the principal goal of the smart manufacturing system is to rapidly detect (or anticipate) failures to reduce operational cost and eliminate downtime. This often boils down to detecting anomalies within the sensor date acquired from the system. The smart manufacturing application domain poses certain salient technical challenges. In particular, there are often multiple types of sensors with varying capabilities and costs. The sensor data characteristics change with the operating point of the environment or machines, such as, the RPM of the motor. The anomaly detection process therefore has to be calibrated near an operating point. In this paper, we analyze four datasets from sensors deployed from manufacturing testbeds. We evaluate the performance of several traditional and ML-based forecasting models for predicting the time series of sensor data. Then, considering the sparse data from one kind of sensor, we perform transfer learning from a high data rate sensor to perform defect type classification. Taken together, we show that predictive failure classification can be achieved, thus paving the way for predictive maintenance. ",

Thus, models that provide not only point estimations, but also some notion of confidence are beneficial. Gaussian Process (GP) is a powerful Bayesian model that comes with naturally well-calibrated variance estimations. However, it is challenging to learn a stand-alone global GP since merging local kernels leads to privacy leakage. To preserve privacy, previous works that consider federated GPs avoid learning a global model by focusing on the personalized setting or learning an ensemble of local models. We present Federated Bayesian Neural Regression (FedBNR), an algorithm that learns a scalable stand-alone global federated GP that respects clients' privacy. We incorporate deep kernel learning and random features for scalability by defining a unifying random kernel. We show this random kernel can recover any stationary kernel and many non-stationary kernels. We then derive a principled approach of learning a global predictive model as if all client data is centralized. We also learn global kernels with knowledge distillation methods for non-identically and independently distributed (non-i.i.d.) clients. Experiments are conducted on real-world regression datasets and show statistically significant improvements compared to other federated GP models. ",

In this paper, we propose a `retreat in order to advance' way to improve the shock-capturing ability of PINN by using a weighted equations (WE) method with PINN. The primary strategy of the method is to weaken the expression of the network in high compressible regions by adding a local positive and compression-dependent weight into governing equations at each interior point. With this strategy, the network will focus on training smooth parts of the solutions. Then automatically affected by the compressible property near shock waves, a sharp discontinuity appears with the wrong inside-shock-points `compressed' into well-trained smooth regions just like passive particles. In this paper, we study one-dimensional and two-dimensional Euler equations. As illustrated by the comparisons with the high-order classical WENO-Z method in numerical examples, the proposed method can significantly improve the discontinuity computing ability. ",

In our previous work, we have proposed the multi-stage & multi-discriminatory generative adversarial network (MultiSDGAN) to translate OCT scans in high-resolution segmentation labels. In this investigation, we aim to evaluate and compare various combinations of channel and spatial attention to the MultiSDGAN architecture to extract more powerful feature maps by capturing rich contextual relationships to improve segmentation performance. Moreover, we developed and evaluated a guided mutli-stage attention framework where we incorporated a guided attention mechanism by forcing an L-1 loss between a specifically designed binary mask and the generated attention maps. Our ablation study results on the WVU-OCT data-set in five-fold cross-validation (5-CV) suggest that the proposed MultiSDGAN with a serial attention module provides the most competitive performance, and guiding the spatial attention feature maps by binary masks further improves the performance in our proposed network.

As a result, computation and memory costs in resource-limited applications may be significantly reduced by dropping redundant weights, neurons, or layers. There have been many model compression algorithms proposed that provide impressive empirical success. However, a theoretical understanding of model compression is still limited. One problem is understanding if a network is more compressible than another of the same structure. Another problem is quantifying how much one can prune a network with theoretically guaranteed accuracy degradation. In this work, we propose to use the sparsity-sensitive $\\ell_q$-norm ($0<q<1$) to characterize compressibility and provide a relationship between soft sparsity of the weights in the network and the degree of compression with a controlled accuracy degradation bound. We also develop adaptive algorithms for pruning each neuron in the network informed by our theory.

    "abstract": "This chapter provides a comprehensive and self-contained discussion of the most recent developments of information theory of networks. Maximum entropy models of networks are the least biased ensembles enforcing a set of constraints and are used in a number of application to produce null model of networks. Here maximum entropy ensembles of networks are introduced by distinguishing between microcanonical and canonical ensembles revealing the the non-equivalence of these two classes of ensembles in the case in which an extensive number of constraints is imposed. It is very common that network data includes also meta-data describing feature of the nodes such as their position in a real or in an abstract space. The features of the nodes can be treated as latent variables that determine the cost associated to each link. Maximum entropy network ensembles with latent variables include spatial networks and their generalisation. In this chapter we cover the case of transportation networks including airport and rail networks. Maximum entropy network ensemble satisfy a given set of constraints. However traditional approaches do not provide any insight on the origin of such constraints. We use information theory principles to find the optimal distribution of latent variables in the framework of the classical information theory of networks. This theory explains the \"blessing of non-uniformity\" of data guaranteeing the efficiency of inference algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "The cancer prognosis on gigapixel Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) has always been a challenging task. Most existing approaches focus solely on single-resolution images. The multi-resolution schemes, utilizing image pyramids to enhance WSI visual representations, have not yet been paid enough attention to. In order to explore a multi-resolution solution for improving cancer prognosis accuracy, this paper proposes a dual-stream architecture to model WSIs by an image pyramid strategy. This architecture consists of two sub-streams: one is for low-resolution WSIs, and the other is especially for high-resolution ones. Compared to other approaches, our scheme has three highlights: (i) there exists a one-to-one relation between stream and resolution; (ii) a square pooling layer is added to align the patches from two resolution streams, largely reducing computation cost and enabling a natural stream feature fusion; (iii) a cross-attention-based method is proposed to pool high-resolution patches spatially under the guidance of low-resolution ones. We validate our scheme on three publicly-available datasets, a total number of 3,101 WSIs from 1,911 patients. Experimental results verify that (1) hierarchical dual-stream representation is more effective than single-stream ones for cancer prognosis, gaining an average C-Index rise of 5.0% and 1.8% on a single low-resolution and high-resolution stream, respectively; (2) our dual-stream scheme could outperform current state-of-the-art ones, by a 5.1% average improvement of C-Index; (3) the cancer diseases with observable survival differences could have different preferences for model complexity. Our scheme could serve as an alternative tool for further facilitating WSI prognosis research. ",

The idea is to view the set of neighbourhoods of a variable as a subset lattice, and partition this lattice into convex sublattices, each of which directly encodes a collection of conditional independence relations. We show that this decomposition exists in any compositional graphoid and can be computed efficiently and consistently in high-dimensions. {In particular, this gives a way to encode all of independence relations implied by a distribution that satisfies the composition axiom, which is strictly weaker than the faithfulness assumption that is typically assumed by graphical approaches.} We also discuss various special cases such as graphical models and projection lattices, each of which has intuitive interpretations. Along the way, we see how this problem is closely related to neighbourhood regression, which has been extensively studied in the context of graphical models and structural equations. ",

    "abstract": "An accelerated failure time (AFT) model assumes a log-linear relationship between failure times and a set of covariates. In contrast to other popular survival models that work on hazard functions, the effects of covariates are directly on failure times, whose interpretation is intuitive. The semiparametric AFT model that does not specify the error distribution is flexible and robust to departures from the distributional assumption. Owing to the desirable features, this class of models has been considered as a promising alternative to the popular Cox model in the analysis of censored failure time data. However, in these AFT models, a linear predictor for the mean is typically assumed. Little research has addressed the nonlinearity of predictors when modeling the mean. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have received a focal attention over the past decades and have achieved remarkable success in a variety of fields. DNNs have a number of notable advantages and have been shown to be particularly useful in addressing the nonlinearity. By taking advantage of this, we propose to apply DNNs in fitting AFT models using a Gehan-type loss, combined with a sub-sampling technique. Finite sample properties of the proposed DNN and rank based AFT model (DeepR-AFT) are investigated via an extensive stimulation study. DeepR-AFT shows a superior performance over its parametric or semiparametric counterparts when the predictor is nonlinear. For linear predictors, DeepR-AFT performs better when the dimensions of covariates are large. The proposed DeepR-AFT is illustrated using two real datasets, which demonstrates its superiority. ",

    "abstract": "Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo ground-based interferometers are poised to probe an unprecedentedly large volume of space, enhancing the discovery power of the observations to even new sources of gravitational wave emitters. In this scenario, the development of highly optimized gravitational wave detection algorithms is crucial. We propose a novel layered framework for real-time detection of gravitational waves inspired by speech processing techniques and, in the present implementation, based on a state-of-the-art machine learning approach involving a hybridization of genetic programming and neural networks. The key aspects of the newly proposed framework are: the well structured, layered approach, and the low computational complexity. The paper describes the basic concepts of the framework and the derivation of the first three layers. Even if, in the present implementation, the layers are based on models derived using a machine learning approach, the proposed layered structure has a universal nature. To train and test the models, we used simulated binary black hole gravitational wave waveforms in synthetic Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity design. Compared to more complex approaches, such as convolutional neural networks, our framework, even using the simple ground model described in the paper, has similar performance but with a much lower computational complexity and a higher degree of modularity. Furthermore, the underlying exploitation of short-term features makes the results of the new framework virtually independent against time-position of gravitational wave signals, simplifying its future exploitation in real-time multi-layer pipelines for gravitational-wave detection with second generation interferometers.

In this regard, the Wake-up Signal (WuS) technology, which aims to minimize the energy consumed by the radio interface of the machine-type devices (MTDs), stands as a promising solution. However, state-of-the-art WuS mechanisms use static operational parameters, so they cannot efficiently adapt to the system dynamics. To overcome this, we design a simple but efficient neural network to predict MTC traffic patterns and configure WuS accordingly. Our proposed forecasting WuS (FWuS) leverages an accurate long-short term memory (LSTM)- based traffic prediction that allows extending the sleep time of MTDs by avoiding frequent page monitoring occasions in idle state. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our approach. The traffic prediction errors are shown to be below 4%, being false alarm and miss-detection probabilities respectively below 8.8% and 1.3%. In terms of energy consumption reduction, FWuS can outperform the best benchmark mechanism in up to 32%. Finally, we certify the ability of FWuS to dynamically adapt to traffic density changes, promoting low-power MTC scalability ",

    "abstract": "Finding cancer driver genes has been a focal theme of cancer research and clinical studies. One of the recent approaches is based on network structural controllability that focuses on finding a control scheme and driver genes that can steer the cell from an arbitrary state to a designated state. While theoretically sound, this approach is impractical for many reasons, e.g., the control scheme is often not unique and half of the nodes may be driver genes for the cell. We developed a novel approach that transcends structural controllability. Instead of considering driver genes for one control scheme, we considered control hub genes that reside in the middle of a control path of every control scheme. Control hubs are the most vulnerable spots for controlling the cell and exogenous stimuli on them may render the cell uncontrollable. We adopted control hubs as cancer-keep genes (CKGs) and applied them to a gene regulatory network of bladder cancer (BLCA). All the genes on the cell cycle and p53 singling pathways in BLCA are CKGs, confirming the importance of these genes and the two pathways in cancer. A smaller set of 35 sensitive CKGs (sCKGs) for BLCA was identified by removing network links. Six sCKGs (RPS6KA3, FGFR3, N-cadherin (CDH2), EP300, caspase-1, and FN1) were subjected to small-interferencing-RNA knockdown in four cell lines to validate their effects on the proliferation or migration of cancer cells. Knocking down RPS6KA3 in a mouse model of BLCA significantly inhibited the growth of tumor xenografts in the mouse model. Combined, our results demonstrated the value of CKGs as therapeutic targets for cancer therapy and the potential of CKGs as an effective means for studying and characterizing cancer etiology. ",

With rich results, we demonstrated the robustness of the proposed architecture. From an efficiency perspective, our algorithm can process at ($\\approx45$) frames per second on RTX 3090 GPU.

Multimodal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans play an important role in the study of glioma prognosis OS time. Several deep learning-based methods are proposed for the OS time prediction on multi-modal MRI problems. However, these methods usually fuse multi-modal information at the beginning or at the end of the deep learning networks and lack the fusion of features from different scales. In addition, the fusion at the end of networks always adapts global with global (eg. fully connected after concatenation of global average pooling output) or local with local (eg. bilinear pooling), which loses the information of local with global. In this paper, we propose a novel method for multi-modal OS time prediction of brain tumor patients, which contains an improved nonlocal features fusion module introduced on different scales. Our method obtains a relative 8.76% improvement over the current state-of-art method (0.6989 vs. 0.6426 on accuracy).

    "abstract": "While previously thought to be uniquely human, cumulative cultural evolution continues to be found in non-human animals. It occurs when an adaptive innovation from an individual is repeatedly passed onto consecutive generations through social learning. For example, pigeons who fly alone or in stable pairs show relatively rigid sub-optimal routes, but gradually improve route efficiency over generations of pairs in which experienced members are swapped for naive ones. This raises the question of what the minimally required cognitive architecture is for cumulative cultural evolution to emerge. Here, I aimed to answer this question in artificial agents who employ three main functions: goal-direction, social proximity, and route memory. At the optima for efficiency and generational efficiency improvement, agents replicated cumulative culture observed in pigeons. At each optimum, paths were determined primarily by memory, and to a lesser extent by social proximity and goal-direction. Because of their need for social proximity, each naive agent stayed close to their experienced counterpart as that followed its memorised path. However, unhindered by route memory, the naive agent's heading was more likely to err towards the goal. This subtly biased pairs' routes, and the resulting efficiency improvement is thus regression to the goal. The resulting incremental improvements over generations meet all core criteria in current frameworks of cumulative cultural evolution, suggesting that rudimentary cumulative optimisation is an evolutionary mechanism that emerges even in simple systems that prefer social proximity and have a memory capacity.

Traditional non-rigid registration methods are generally computationally intense and time-consuming. Deep learning approaches are promising in achieving high accuracy with fast speed, but have yet been investigated with consideration for tracer distribution changes or in the whole-body scope. In this work, we developed an unsupervised automatic deep learning-based framework to correct inter-frame body motion. The motion estimation network is a convolutional neural network with a combined convolutional long short-term memory layer, fully utilizing dynamic temporal features and spatial information. Our dataset contains 27 subjects each under a 90-min FDG whole-body dynamic PET scan. With 9-fold cross-validation, compared with both traditional and deep learning baselines, we demonstrated that the proposed network obtained superior performance in enhanced qualitative and quantitative spatial alignment between parametric $K_{i}$ and $V_{b}$ images and in significantly reduced parametric fitting error. We also showed the potential of the proposed motion correction method for impacting downstream analysis of the estimated parametric images, improving the ability to distinguish malignant from benign hypermetabolic regions of interest. Once trained, the motion estimation inference time of our proposed network was around 460 times faster than the conventional registration baseline, showing its potential to be easily applied in clinical settings.
