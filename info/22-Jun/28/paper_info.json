    "title": "A novel approach to increase scalability while training machine learning  algorithms using Bfloat 16 in credit card fraud detection",
    "abstract": "The use of credit cards has become quite common these days as digital banking has become the norm. With this increase, fraud in credit cards also has a huge problem and loss to the banks and customers alike. Normal fraud detection systems, are not able to detect the fraud since fraudsters emerge with new techniques to commit fraud. This creates the need to use machine learning-based software to detect frauds. Currently, the machine learning softwares that are available focuses only on the accuracy of detecting frauds but does not focus on the cost or time factors to detect. This research focuses on machine learning scalability for banks' credit card fraud detection systems. We have compared the existing machine learning algorithms and methods that are available with the newly proposed technique. The goal is to prove that using fewer bits for training a machine learning algorithm will result in a more scalable system, that will reduce the time and will also be less costly to implement. ",

    "title": "Geometry Interaction Knowledge Graph Embeddings",
    "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) embeddings have shown great power in learning representations of entities and relations for link prediction tasks. Previous work usually embeds KGs into a single geometric space such as Euclidean space (zero curved), hyperbolic space (negatively curved) or hyperspherical space (positively curved) to maintain their specific geometric structures (e.g., chain, hierarchy and ring structures). However, the topological structure of KGs appears to be complicated, since it may contain multiple types of geometric structures simultaneously. Therefore, embedding KGs in a single space, no matter the Euclidean space, hyperbolic space or hyperspheric space, cannot capture the complex structures of KGs accurately. To overcome this challenge, we propose Geometry Interaction knowledge graph Embeddings (GIE), which learns spatial structures interactively between the Euclidean, hyperbolic and hyperspherical spaces. Theoretically, our proposed GIE can capture a richer set of relational information, model key inference patterns, and enable expressive semantic matching across entities. Experimental results on three well-established knowledge graph completion benchmarks show that our GIE achieves the state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. ",

    "abstract": "The Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) is an important metering device for smart grid. Like any other Intelligent Electronic Device (IED), PMUs are prone to various types of cyberattacks. However, one form of attack is unique to the PMU, the GPS-spoofing attack, where the time and /or the one second pulse that enables time synchronization are modified and the measurements are computed using the modified time reference. This article exploits the vulnerability of PMUs in their GPS time synchronization signal. At first, the paper proposes an undetectable attack scheme which is able to bypass Bad Data Detection (BDD) algorithms used with PMU data. The attack is applied by solving a convex optimization criterion at regular time interval, so that after a specific time period the attack vector incurs a significant change in the angle information delivered by the PMU. Secondly, the impact of phase angle shift on the power flow calculation between two adjacent nodes of the transmission line is analyzed with numerical experiment using IEEE 39 bus system. Moreover, the undetectibilities of the proposed attack scheme against conventional $\\chi^2$, Weighted Least Squares (WLS) and Kalman Filtering test on the estimation residuals are investigated. Finally, the power flow results with the proposed attack are compared with the results using a random GPS-spoofing attack. It can be observed that using the proposed method enables the attacker with more control over the impact against power grid than it is for the random attack. Furthermore, the proposed attack model has demonstrated a very small probability of detection against each of the common detection methods. For WLS and KF, the attack is detected only about 1-20$\\%$ of the times, whereas for $\\chi^2$-test, the attack goes undetected 100 $\\%$ of the times. ",

    "abstract": "Classical theory in reinforcement learning (RL) predominantly focuses on the single task setting, where an agent learns to solve a task through trial-and-error experience, given access to data only from that task. However, many recent empirical works have demonstrated the significant practical benefits of leveraging a joint representation trained across multiple, related tasks. In this work we theoretically analyze such a setting, formalizing the concept of task relatedness as a shared state-action representation that admits linear dynamics in all the tasks. We introduce the Shared-MatrixRL algorithm for the setting of Multitask MatrixRL. In the presence of $P$ episodic tasks of dimension $d$ sharing a joint $r \\ll d$ low-dimensional representation, we show the regret on the the $P$ tasks can be improved from $O(PHd\\sqrt{NH})$ to $O((Hd\\sqrt{rP} + HP\\sqrt{rd})\\sqrt{NH})$ over $N$ episodes of horizon $H$. These gains coincide with those observed in other linear models in contextual bandits and RL. In contrast with previous work that have studied multi task RL in other function approximation models, we show that in the presence of bilinear optimization oracle and finite state action spaces there exists a computationally efficient algorithm for multitask MatrixRL via a reduction to quadratic programming. We also develop a simple technique to shave off a $\\sqrt{H}$ factor from the regret upper bounds of some episodic linear problems. ",

However, the current HMDs focus solely on the CPU core of a System-on-Chip (SoC) and, therefore, do not exploit the full potential of the hardware telemetry. In this paper, we propose XMD, an HMD that operates on an expansive set of telemetry channels extracted from the different subsystems of SoC. Key innovations in XMD are guided by analytical theorems that leverage the concept of manifold hypothesis. XMD exploits the thread-level profiling power of the CPU-core telemetry, and the global profiling power of non-core telemetry channels, to achieve significantly better detection performance and concept drift robustness than currently used Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) based detectors. We train and evaluate XMD using hardware telemetries collected from 904 benign applications and 1205 malware samples. XMD improves over currently used HPC-based detectors by 32.91% for the in-distribution test data and by 67.57% for the concept drift test data. XMD achieves the best detection performance of 86.54% with a false positive rate of 2.9%, compared to the detection rate of 80%, offered by the best performing software-based Anti-Virus(AV) on VirusTotal, on the same set of malware samples.

    "abstract": "The control of nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics has been a significant field of research for many years. This paper presents a novel data-driven optimal adaptive control structure with less control effort and faster adaptation than standard adaptive control counterparts. The proposed control structure utilizes the system's recorded data to increase the speed of adaptation and performance dramatically. In this study, we employ a conditional generative adversarial net (CGAN) as a novel central pattern generator to reproduce the steady-state harmonic pattern of the control signals matching the system's uncertainties over a wide range. We can also use the CGAN architecture as a fault detector. The CGAN provides a low-dimensional latent space of uncertainties. It enables rapid and convenient adaptation when there are many parametric uncertainties, especially for large-scale systems. Then, we introduce a novel meta-reinforcement learning framework to adapt the latent space of CGAN to the system's uncertainties as an optimal direct adaptive controller without any system identifier. Another part of the control structure is a regulator that achieves semi-global asymptotic tracking using the Lyapunov stability analysis. Finally, via some simulations, we evaluate the capabilities of the proposed designs on two dynamical systems, a robot manipulator and a large-scale musculoskeletal structure, in the presence of disturbance and perturbation.

We present a new fault detection method for vibration-monitored drivetrains that does not require any feature engineering. Our method relies on a simple model architecture to enable a straightforward implementation in practice. We propose to apply convolutional autoencoders for identifying and extracting the most relevant features from the half spectrum in an automated manner, saving time and effort. Thereby, a spectral model of the normal vibration response is learnt for the monitored component from past measurements. We demonstrate that the model can successfully distinguish damaged from healthy components and detect a damaged generator bearing and damaged gearbox parts from their vibration responses. Using measurements from commercial wind turbines and a test rig, we show that vibration-based fault detection in wind turbine drivetrains can be performed without the usual upfront definition of spectral features. Another advantage of the presented method is that the entire half spectrum is monitored instead of the usual focus on monitoring individual frequencies and harmonics. ",

While event cameras can measure subtle brightness changes in high frame rates, the measurements in low lighting or extreme motion suffer from significant domain discrepancy with complex noise. As a result, the performance of event-based vision tasks does not transfer to challenging environments, where the event cameras are expected to thrive over normal cameras. We find that the multi-view consistency of NeRF provides a powerful self-supervision signal for eliminating the spurious measurements and extracting the consistent underlying structure despite highly noisy input. Instead of posed images of the original NeRF, the input to Ev-NeRF is the event measurements accompanied by the movements of the sensors. Using the loss function that reflects the measurement model of the sensor, Ev-NeRF creates an integrated neural volume that summarizes the unstructured and sparse data points captured for about 2-4 seconds. The generated neural volume can also produce intensity images from novel views with reasonable depth estimates, which can serve as a high-quality input to various vision-based tasks. Our results show that Ev-NeRF achieves competitive performance for intensity image reconstruction under extreme noise conditions and high-dynamic-range imaging. ",

    "abstract": "To enable safe autonomous vehicle (AV) operations, it is critical that an AV's obstacle detection module can reliably detect obstacles that pose a safety threat (i.e., are safety-critical). It is therefore desirable that the evaluation metric for the perception system captures the safety-criticality of objects. Unfortunately, existing perception evaluation metrics tend to make strong assumptions about the objects and ignore the dynamic interactions between agents, and thus do not accurately capture the safety risks in reality. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an interaction-dynamics-aware obstacle detection evaluation metric by accounting for closed-loop dynamic interactions between an ego vehicle and obstacles in the scene. By borrowing existing theory from optimal control theory, namely Hamilton-Jacobi reachability, we present a computationally tractable method for constructing a ``safety zone'': a region in state space that defines where safety-critical obstacles lie for the purpose of defining safety metrics. Our proposed safety zone is mathematically complete, and can be easily computed to reflect a variety of safety requirements. Using an off-the-shelf detection algorithm from the nuScenes detection challenge leaderboard, we demonstrate that our approach is computationally lightweight, and can better capture safety-critical perception errors than a baseline approach.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a real-time neural network (NN) stochastic filter-based controller on the Lie Group of the Special Orthogonal Group $SO(3)$ as a novel approach to the attitude tracking problem. The introduced solution consists of two parts: a filter and a controller. Firstly, an adaptive NN-based stochastic filter is proposed that estimates attitude components and dynamics using measurements supplied by onboard sensors directly. The filter design accounts for measurement uncertainties inherent to the attitude dynamics, namely unknown bias and noise corrupting angular velocity measurements. The closed loop signals of the proposed NN-based stochastic filter have been shown to be semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). Secondly, a novel control law on $SO(3)$ coupled with the proposed estimator is presented. The control law addresses unknown disturbances. In addition, the closed loop signals of the proposed filter-based controller have been shown to be SGUUB. The proposed approach offers robust tracking performance by supplying the required control signal given data extracted from low-cost inertial measurement units. While the filter-based controller is presented in continuous form, the discrete implementation is also presented. Additionally, the unit-quaternion form of the proposed approach is given. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed filter-based controller is demonstrated using its discrete form and considering low sampling rate, high initialization error, high-level of measurement uncertainties, and unknown disturbances.

    "abstract": "Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is a preclinical stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) which occurs even before mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Progressive SCD will convert to MCI with the potential of further evolving to AD. Therefore, early identification of progressive SCD with neuroimaging techniques (e.g., structural MRI) is of great clinical value for early intervention of AD. However, existing MRI-based machine/deep learning methods usually suffer the small-sample-size problem which poses a great challenge to related neuroimaging analysis. The central question we aim to tackle in this paper is how to leverage related domains (e.g., AD/NC) to assist the progression prediction of SCD. Meanwhile, we are concerned about which brain areas are more closely linked to the identification of progressive SCD. To this end, we propose an attention-guided autoencoder model for efficient cross-domain adaptation which facilitates the knowledge transfer from AD to SCD. The proposed model is composed of four key components: 1) a feature encoding module for learning shared subspace representations of different domains, 2) an attention module for automatically locating discriminative brain regions of interest defined in brain atlases, 3) a decoding module for reconstructing the original input, 4) a classification module for identification of brain diseases. Through joint training of these four modules, domain invariant features can be learned. Meanwhile, the brain disease related regions can be highlighted by the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on the publicly available ADNI dataset and a private CLAS dataset have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed model is straightforward to train and test with only 5-10 seconds on CPUs and is suitable for medical tasks with small datasets. ",

We consider an active shape model, where -- for an object category -- we are given a library of potential CAD models describing objects in that category, and we adopt a standard formulation where pose and shape are estimated from 2D or 3D keypoints via non-convex optimization. Our first contribution is to develop PACE3D* and PACE2D*, the first certifiably optimal solvers for pose and shape estimation using 3D and 2D keypoints, respectively. Both solvers rely on the design of tight (i.e., exact) semidefinite relaxations. Our second contribution is to develop outlier-robust versions of both solvers, named PACE3D# and PACE2D#. Towards this goal, we propose ROBIN, a general graph-theoretic framework to prune outliers, which uses compatibility hypergraphs to model measurements' compatibility. We show that in category-level perception problems these hypergraphs can be built from winding orders of the keypoints (in 2D) or their convex hulls (in 3D), and many outliers can be pruned via maximum hyperclique computation. The last contribution is an extensive experimental evaluation. Besides providing an ablation study on simulated datasets and on the PASCAL dataset, we combine our solver with a deep keypoint detector, and show that PACE3D# improves over the state of the art in vehicle pose estimation in the ApolloScape datasets, and its runtime is compatible with practical applications.

In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Graph Neural Module Network (HGNMN) that reasons over multi-layer graphs with neural modules to address the above issues. Specifically, we first encode the image by multi-layer graphs from the visual, semantic and commonsense views since the clues that support the answer may exist in different modalities. Our model consists of several well-designed neural modules that perform specific functions over graphs, which can be used to conduct multi-step reasoning within and between different graphs. Compared to existing modular networks, we extend visual reasoning from one graph to more graphs. We can explicitly trace the reasoning process according to module weights and graph attentions. Experiments show that our model not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CRIC dataset but also obtains explicit and explainable reasoning procedures. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised methods have significantly closed the gap with end-to-end supervised learning for image classification. In the case of human action videos, however, where both appearance and motion are significant factors of variation, this gap remains significant. One of the key reasons for this is that sampling pairs of similar video clips, a required step for many self-supervised contrastive learning methods, is currently done conservatively to avoid false positives. A typical assumption is that similar clips only occur temporally close within a single video, leading to insufficient examples of motion similarity. To mitigate this, we propose SLIC, a clustering-based self-supervised contrastive learning method for human action videos. Our key contribution is that we improve upon the traditional intra-video positive sampling by using iterative clustering to group similar video instances. This enables our method to leverage pseudo-labels from the cluster assignments to sample harder positives and negatives. SLIC outperforms state-of-the-art video retrieval baselines by +15.4% on top-1 recall on UCF101 and by +5.7% when directly transferred to HMDB51.

    "abstract": "As machine learning (ML) systems become increasingly widespread, it is necessary to audit these systems for biases prior to their deployment. Recent research has developed algorithms for effectively identifying intersectional bias in the form of interpretable, underperforming subsets (or slices) of the data. However, these solutions and their insights are limited without a tool for visually understanding and interacting with the results of these algorithms. We propose Visual Auditor, an interactive visualization tool for auditing and summarizing model biases. Visual Auditor assists model validation by providing an interpretable overview of intersectional bias (bias that is present when examining populations defined by multiple features), details about relationships between problematic data slices, and a comparison between underperforming and overperforming data slices in a model. Our open-source tool runs directly in both computational notebooks and web browsers, making model auditing accessible and easily integrated into current ML development workflows. An observational user study in collaboration with domain experts at Fiddler AI highlights that our tool can help ML practitioners identify and understand model biases. ",

    "abstract": "This paper considers joint active user detection (AUD) and channel estimation (CE) for massive connectivity scenarios with sporadic traffic. The state-of-art method under a Bayesian framework to perform joint AUD and CE in such scenarios is approximate message passing (AMP). However, the existing theoretical analysis of AMP-based joint AUD and CE can only be performed with a given fixed point of the AMP state evolution function, lacking the analysis of AMP phase transition and Bayes-optimality. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical framework to analyze the performance of the joint AUD and CE problem by adopting the replica method in the Bayes-optimal condition. Specifically, our analysis is based on a general channel model, which reduces to particular channel models in multiple typical MIMO communication scenarios. Our theoretical framework allows ones to measure the optimality and phase transition of AMP-based joint AUD and CE as well as to predict the corresponding performance metrics under our model. To reify our proposed theoretical framework, we analyze two typical scenarios from the massive random access literature, i.e., the isotropic channel scenario and the spatially correlated channel scenario. Accordingly, our performance analysis produces some novel results for both the isotropic Raleigh channel and spatially correlated channel case. ",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms suffer severe performance degradation when the interaction data is scarce, which limits their real-world application. Recently, visual representation learning has been shown to be effective and promising for boosting sample efficiency in RL. These methods usually rely on contrastive learning and data augmentation to train a transition model for state prediction, which is different from how the model is used in RL--performing value-based planning. Accordingly, the learned model may not be able to align well with the environment and generate consistent value predictions, especially when the state transition is not deterministic. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, called value-consistent representation learning (VCR), to learn representations that are directly related to decision-making. More specifically, VCR trains a model to predict the future state (also referred to as the ''imagined state'') based on the current one and a sequence of actions. Instead of aligning this imagined state with a real state returned by the environment, VCR applies a $Q$-value head on both states and obtains two distributions of action values. Then a distance is computed and minimized to force the imagined state to produce a similar action value prediction as that by the real state. We develop two implementations of the above idea for the discrete and continuous action spaces respectively. We conduct experiments on Atari 100K and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks to validate their effectiveness for improving sample efficiency. It has been demonstrated that our methods achieve new state-of-the-art performance for search-free RL algorithms. ",

Meanwhile, most existing representation learning methods embed the heterogeneous graphs into a single geometric space, either Euclidean or hyperbolic. This kind of single geometric view is usually not enough to observe the complete picture of heterogeneous graphs due to their rich semantics and complex structures. Under these observations, this paper proposes a novel self-supervised learning method, termed as Geometry Contrastive Learning (GCL), to better represent the heterogeneous graphs when supervisory data is unavailable. GCL views a heterogeneous graph from Euclidean and hyperbolic perspective simultaneously, aiming to make a strong merger of the ability of modeling rich semantics and complex structures, which is expected to bring in more benefits for downstream tasks. GCL maximizes the mutual information between two geometric views by contrasting representations at both local-local and local-global semantic levels. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks data sets show that the proposed approach outperforms the strong baselines, including both unsupervised methods and supervised methods, on three tasks, including node classification, node clustering and similarity search.

Although existing methods for the semantic textual similarity (STS) task can be easily adapted to this task, the CRE task has some unique properties that can be leveraged to augment the datasets for addressing its data scarcity problem. In this paper, we construct a graph named ConcreteGraph (Concept relatedness estimation Graph) to take advantage of the CRE properties. For the sampled new concept pairs from the ConcreteGraph, we add an additional step of filtering out the new concept pairs with low quality based on simple yet effective quality thresholding. We apply the ConcreteGraph data augmentation on three Transformer-based models to show its efficacy. Detailed ablation study for quality thresholding further shows that even a limited amount of high-quality data is more beneficial than a large quantity of unthresholded data. This paper is the first one to work on the WORD dataset and the proposed ConcreteGraph can boost the accuracy of the Transformers by more than 2%. All three Transformers, with the help of ConcreteGraph, can outperform the current state-of-theart method, Concept Interaction Graph (CIG), on the CNSE and CNSS datasets. ",

Existing well-established methods are committed to taking the average of the predicted HRs of multiple overlapping video clips as the final results for the 30-second facial video. Although these methods with hundreds of layers and thousands of channels are highly accurate and robust, they require enormous computational budget and a 30-second wait time, which greatly limits the application of the algorithms to scale. Under these cicumstacnces, We propose a lightweight fast pulse simulation network (LFPS-Net), pursuing the best accuracy within a very limited computational and time budget, focusing on common mobile platforms, such as smart phones. In order to suppress the noise component and get stable pulse in a short time, we design a multi-frequency modal signal fusion mechanism, which exploits the theory of time-frequency domain analysis to separate multi-modal information from complex signals. It helps proceeding network learn the effective fetures more easily without adding any parameter. In addition, we design a oversampling training strategy to solve the problem caused by the unbalanced distribution of dataset. For the 30-second facial videos, our proposed method achieves the best results on most of the evaluation metrics for estimating heart rate or heart rate variability compared to the best available papers. The proposed method can still obtain very competitive results by using a short-time (~15-second) facail video. ",

Comparing with multi-style TTS by predicting style tags trained on the same dataset but with human annotations, our method achieves improved results according to subjective evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test sets in audiobook speech.

Our work aims to improve the user experience while minimizing the delay and simultaneously considering efficient utilization of limited edge resources. First, an optimal service placement is performed while considering traffic dynamicity and meeting the service requirements with the use of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework. Next, an optimal secondary mapping and service recovery placements are performed to account for the attacks/failures at the edge. The use of DRL framework helps to adapt to dynamically varying IoV traffic and service demands.

    "abstract": "Face recognition has achieved considerable progress in recent years thanks to the development of deep neural networks, but it has recently been discovered that deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples. This means that face recognition models or systems based on deep neural networks are also susceptible to adversarial examples. However, the existing methods of attacking face recognition models or systems with adversarial examples can effectively complete white-box attacks but not black-box impersonation attacks, physical attacks, or convenient attacks, particularly on commercial face recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a new method to attack face recognition models or systems called RSTAM, which enables an effective black-box impersonation attack using an adversarial mask printed by a mobile and compact printer. First, RSTAM enhances the transferability of the adversarial masks through our proposed random similarity transformation strategy. Furthermore, we propose a random meta-optimization strategy for ensembling several pre-trained face models to generate more general adversarial masks. Finally, we conduct experiments on the CelebA-HQ, LFW, Makeup Transfer (MT), and CASIA-FaceV5 datasets. The performance of the attacks is also evaluated on state-of-the-art commercial face recognition systems: Face++, Baidu, Aliyun, Tencent, and Microsoft. Extensive experiments show that RSTAM can effectively perform black-box impersonation attacks on face recognition models or systems. ",

    "abstract": "Thanks to the efficient retrieval speed and low storage consumption, learning to hash has been widely used in visual retrieval tasks. However, existing hashing methods assume that the query and retrieval samples lie in homogeneous feature space within the same domain. As a result, they cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous cross-domain retrieval. In this paper, we propose a Generalized Image Transfer Retrieval (GITR) problem, which encounters two crucial bottlenecks: 1) the query and retrieval samples may come from different domains, leading to an inevitable {domain distribution gap}; 2) the features of the two domains may be heterogeneous or misaligned, bringing up an additional {feature gap}. To address the GITR problem, we propose an Asymmetric Transfer Hashing (ATH) framework with its unsupervised/semi-supervised/supervised realizations. Specifically, ATH characterizes the domain distribution gap by the discrepancy between two asymmetric hash functions, and minimizes the feature gap with the help of a novel adaptive bipartite graph constructed on cross-domain data. By jointly optimizing asymmetric hash functions and the bipartite graph, not only can knowledge transfer be achieved but information loss caused by feature alignment can also be avoided. Meanwhile, to alleviate negative transfer, the intrinsic geometrical structure of single-domain data is preserved by involving a domain affinity graph. Extensive experiments on both single-domain and cross-domain benchmarks under different GITR subtasks indicate the superiority of our ATH method in comparison with the state-of-the-art hashing methods.

    "abstract": "When investigating epidemic dynamics through differential models, the parameters needed to understand the phenomenon and to simulate forecast scenarios require a delicate calibration phase, often made even more challenging by the scarcity and uncertainty of the observed data reported by official sources. In this context, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), by embedding the knowledge of the differential model that governs the physical phenomenon in the learning process, can effectively address the inverse and forward problem of data-driven learning and solving the corresponding epidemic problem. In many circumstances, however, the spatial propagation of an infectious disease is characterized by movements of individuals at different scales governed by multiscale PDEs. This reflects the heterogeneity of a region or territory in relation to the dynamics within cities and in neighboring zones. In presence of multiple scales, a direct application of PINNs generally leads to poor results due to the multiscale nature of the differential model in the loss function of the neural network. To allow the neural network to operate uniformly with respect to the small scales, it is desirable that the neural network satisfies an Asymptotic-Preservation (AP) property in the learning process. To this end, we consider a new class of AP Neural Networks (APNNs) for multiscale hyperbolic transport models of epidemic spread that, thanks to an appropriate AP formulation of the loss function, is capable to work uniformly at the different scales of the system. A series of numerical tests for different epidemic scenarios confirms the validity of the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of the AP property in the neural network when dealing with multiscale problems especially in presence of sparse and partially observed systems.

    "abstract": "As the bridge between genetic and physiological aspects, animal behaviour analysis is one of the most significant topics in biology and ecological research. However, identifying, tracking and recording animal behaviour are labour intensive works that require professional knowledge. To mitigate the spend for annotating data, researchers turn to computer vision techniques for automatic label algorithms, since most of the data are recorded visually. In this work, we explore a variety of behaviour detection algorithms, covering traditional vision methods, statistical methods and deep learning methods. The objective of this work is to provide a thorough investigation of related work, furnishing biologists with a scratch of efficient animal behaviour detection methods. Apart from that, we also discuss the strengths and weaknesses of those algorithms to provide some insights for those who already delve into this field. ",

    "abstract": "Backdoor learning is an emerging and important topic of studying the vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs). Many pioneering backdoor attack and defense methods are being proposed successively or concurrently, in the status of a rapid arms race. However, we find that the evaluations of new methods are often unthorough to verify their claims and real performance, mainly due to the rapid development, diverse settings, as well as the difficulties of implementation and reproducibility. Without thorough evaluations and comparisons, it is difficult to track the current progress and design the future development roadmap of the literature. To alleviate this dilemma, we build a comprehensive benchmark of backdoor learning, called BackdoorBench. It consists of an extensible modular based codebase (currently including implementations of 8 state-of-the-art (SOTA) attack and 9 SOTA defense algorithms), as well as a standardized protocol of a complete backdoor learning. We also provide comprehensive evaluations of every pair of 8 attacks against 9 defenses, with 5 poisoning ratios, based on 5 models and 4 datasets, thus 8,000 pairs of evaluations in total. We further present analysis from different perspectives about these 8,000 evaluations, studying the effects of attack against defense algorithms, poisoning ratio, model and dataset in backdoor learning. All codes and evaluations of BackdoorBench are publicly available at \\url{https://backdoorbench.github.io}. ",

    "abstract": "Extracting a proper dynamic network for modelling a time-dependent complex system is an important issue. Building a correct model is related to finding out critical time points where a system exhibits considerable change. In this work, we propose to measure network similarity to detect proper time intervals. We develop three similarity metrics, node, link, and neighborhood similarities, for any consecutive snapshots of a dynamic network. Rather than a label or a user-defined threshold, we use statistically expected values of proposed similarities under a null-model to state whether the system changes critically. We experimented on two different data sets with different temporal dynamics: The Wi-Fi access points logs of a university campus and Enron emails. Results show that, first, proposed similarities reflect similar signal trends with network topological properties with less noisy signals, and their scores are scale invariant. Second, proposed similarities generate better signals than adjacency correlation with optimal noise and diversity. Third, using statistically expected values allows us to find different time intervals for a system, leading to the extraction of non-redundant snapshots for dynamic network modelling. ",

These critical regions are used to drive the in situ analysis, providing greater data fidelity and analysis resolution with an equivalent I/O budget to a traditional in situ framework. We develop a distributed asynchronous in situ visualization by integrating TACC Galaxy with CB-Geo MPM for material point simulation of granular flows. We employ a PyTorch-based 3D Graph Network Simulator (GNS) trained on granular flow problems as an oracle to predict the dynamics of granular flows.

Under perturbation, the method provided absolute accuracy improvements of up to 9.3% in the MNIST data set and 13% in the CIFAR-10 data set. Training using transformed images with higher luminance values increases the robustness of the classifier. We have shown that transfer learning is disadvantageous for adversarial machine learning.

    "abstract": "Estimating how a treatment affects units individually, known as heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation, is an essential part of decision-making and policy implementation. The accumulation of large amounts of data in many domains, such as healthcare and e-commerce, has led to increased interest in developing data-driven algorithms for estimating heterogeneous effects from observational and experimental data. However, these methods often make strong assumptions about the observed features and ignore the underlying causal model structure, which can lead to biased HTE estimation. At the same time, accounting for the causal structure of real-world data is rarely trivial since the causal mechanisms that gave rise to the data are typically unknown. To address this problem, we develop a feature selection method that considers each feature's value for HTE estimation and learns the relevant parts of the causal structure from data. We provide strong empirical evidence that our method improves existing data-driven HTE estimation methods under arbitrary underlying causal structures. Our results on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets show that our feature selection algorithm leads to lower HTE estimation error. ",

Two separate proposals, namely stain normalization (SN) and stain augmentation (SA), have been spotlighted to reduce the generalization error, where the former alleviates the stain shift across different medical centers using template image and the latter enriches the accessible stain styles by the simulation of more stain variations. However, their applications are bounded by the selection of template images and the construction of unrealistic styles. To address the problems, we unify SN and SA with a novel RandStainNA scheme, which constrains variable stain styles in a practicable range to train a stain agnostic deep learning model. The RandStainNA is applicable to stain normalization in a collection of color spaces i.e. HED, HSV, LAB. Additionally, we propose a random color space selection scheme to gain extra performance improvement. We evaluate our method by two diagnostic tasks i.e. tissue subtype classification and nuclei segmentation, with various network backbones. The performance superiority over both SA and SN yields that the proposed RandStainNA can consistently improve the generalization ability, that our models can cope with more incoming clinical datasets with unpredicted stain styles.

Although these attacks were initially conceived of and studied digitally, in that the raw pixel values of the image were perturbed, recent work has demonstrated that these attacks can successfully transfer to the physical world. This can be accomplished by printing out the patch and adding it into scenes of newly captured images or video footage. In this work we further test the efficacy of adversarial patch attacks in the physical world under more challenging conditions. We consider object detection models trained on overhead imagery acquired through aerial or satellite cameras, and we test physical adversarial patches inserted into scenes of a desert environment. Our main finding is that it is far more difficult to successfully implement the adversarial patch attacks under these conditions than in the previously considered conditions. This has important implications for AI safety as the real-world threat posed by adversarial examples may be overstated. ",

Contrary to their (a)synchronous interpretations, the Most Permissive (MP) interpretation guarantees capturing all the trajectories of any quantitative system compatible with the BN, without additional parameters. Notably, the MP mode has the ability to capture transitions related to the heterogeneity of time scales and concentration scales in the abstracted quantitative system and which are not captured by asynchronous modes. So far, the analysis of MPBNs has focused on Boolean dynamical properties, such as the existence of particular trajectories or attractors. This paper addresses the sampling of trajectories from MPBNs in order to quantify the propensities of attractors reachable from a given initial BN configuration. The computation of MP transitions from a configuration is performed by iteratively discovering possible state changes. The number of iterations is referred to as the permissive depth, where the first depth corresponds to the asynchronous transitions. This permissive depth reflects the potential concentration and time scales heterogeneity along the abstracted quantitative process. The simulation of MPBNs is illustrated on several models from the literature, on which the depth parametrization can help to assess the robustness of predictions on attractor propensities changes triggered by model perturbations.

In theory, every department or team in the organization would enrich their datasets with metadata, and store them in a central data lake. Those datasets can then be combined in different ways and produce added value to the organization. In practice, though, the situation is vastly different: each department has its own privacy policies, data release procedures, and goals. As a result, each department maintains its own data lake, leading to data silos. For such data silos to be of any use, they need to be integrated. This paper presents SiMa, a method for federating data silos that consistently finds more correct relationships than the state-of-the-art matching methods, while minimizing wrong predictions and requiring 20x to 1000x less time to execute. SiMa leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn from the existing column relationships and automated data profiles found in data silos. Our method makes use of the trained GNN to perform link prediction and find new column relationships across data silos. Most importantly, SiMa can be trained incrementally on the column relationships within each silo individually, and does not require consolidating all datasets into one place. ",

This implies that nodes with high degrees, betweenness, or clustering coefficients are attacked with higher probability. We mathematically and experimentally analyze the sizes of the giant components of the networks under different types of targeted attacks, and compare the results with the corresponding sizes under random attacks. We show that networks disintegrate faster for targeted attacks compared to random attacks. A targeted attack on a small fraction of high degree nodes disintegrates one or both of the networks, whereas both the networks contain giant components for random attack on the same fraction of nodes. An important observation is that an attacker has an advantage if it compromises nodes based on their betweenness, rather than based on degree or clustering coefficient. We next study adaptive attacks, where an attacker compromises nodes in rounds. Here, some nodes are compromised in each round based on their degree, betweenness or clustering coefficients, instead of compromising all nodes together. In this case, the degree, betweenness, or clustering coefficient is calculated before the start of each round, instead of at the beginning. We show experimentally that an adversary has an advantage in this adaptive approach, compared to compromising the same number of nodes all at once. ",

Fall detection can be performed using wearable devices or ambient sensors; these methods may struggle with user compliance issues or false alarms. Video cameras provide a passive alternative; however, regular RGB cameras are impacted by changing lighting conditions and privacy concerns. From a machine learning perspective, developing an effective fall detection system is challenging because of the rarity and variability of falls. Many existing fall detection datasets lack important real-world considerations, such as varied lighting, continuous activities of daily living (ADLs), and camera placement. The lack of these considerations makes it difficult to develop predictive models that can operate effectively in the real world. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel multi-modality dataset (MUVIM) that contains four visual modalities: infra-red, depth, RGB and thermal cameras. These modalities offer benefits such as obfuscated facial features and improved performance in low-light conditions. We formulated fall detection as an anomaly detection problem, in which a customized spatio-temporal convolutional autoencoder was trained only on ADLs so that a fall would increase the reconstruction error. Our results showed that infra-red cameras provided the highest level of performance (AUC ROC=0.94), followed by thermal (AUC ROC=0.87), depth (AUC ROC=0.86) and RGB (AUC ROC=0.83). This research provides a unique opportunity to analyze the utility of camera modalities in detecting falls in a home setting while balancing performance, passiveness, and privacy. ",

Moreover, the mean sub-sequence reduced method, in which each node discards the extreme value information of cost contributions received from its neighbors, can make the network resilient against Byzantine attacks. In this regard, the proposed RDLMG algorithm ensures that all normal nodes converge to their ideal states with cooperation among nodes.

    "abstract": "Pruning large neural networks to create high-quality, independently trainable sparse masks, which can maintain similar performance to their dense counterparts, is very desirable due to the reduced space and time complexity. As research effort is focused on increasingly sophisticated pruning methods that leads to sparse subnetworks trainable from the scratch, we argue for an orthogonal, under-explored theme: improving training techniques for pruned sub-networks, i.e. sparse training. Apart from the popular belief that only the quality of sparse masks matters for sparse training, in this paper we demonstrate an alternative opportunity: one can \\textit{carefully customize the sparse training techniques to deviate from the default dense network training protocols}, consisting of introducing ``ghost\" neurons and skip connections at the early stage of training, and strategically modifying the initialization as well as labels. Our new sparse training recipe is generally applicable to improving training from scratch with various sparse masks. By adopting our newly curated techniques, we demonstrate significant performance gains across various popular datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet), architectures (ResNet-18/32/104, Vgg16, MobileNet), and sparse mask options (lottery ticket, SNIP/GRASP, SynFlow, or even randomly pruning), compared to the default training protocols, especially at high sparsity levels.

To maintain stakeholders, particularly, end users security, protecting the data from fraudulent efforts is one of the most pressing concerns. A set of malicious programming code, scripts, active content, or intrusive software that is designed to destroy intended computer systems and programs or mobile and web applications is referred to as malware. According to a study, naive users are unable to distinguish between malicious and benign applications. Thus, computer systems and mobile applications should be designed to detect malicious activities towards protecting the stakeholders. A number of algorithms are available to detect malware activities by utilizing novel concepts including Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. In this study, we emphasize Artificial Intelligence (AI) based techniques for detecting and preventing malware activity. We present a detailed review of current malware detection technologies, their shortcomings, and ways to improve efficiency. Our study shows that adopting futuristic approaches for the development of malware detection applications shall provide significant advantages.

    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the user next action based on the ongoing sessions. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in modeling the user preference evolution to capture the fine-grained user interests. While latent user preferences behind the sessions drift continuously over time, most existing approaches still model the temporal session data in discrete state spaces, which are incapable of capturing the fine-grained preference evolution and result in sub-optimal solutions. To this end, we propose Graph Nested GRU ordinary differential equation (ODE), namely GNG-ODE, a novel continuum model that extends the idea of neural ODEs to continuous-time temporal session graphs. The proposed model preserves the continuous nature of dynamic user preferences, encoding both temporal and structural patterns of item transitions into continuous-time dynamic embeddings. As the existing ODE solvers do not consider graph structure change and thus cannot be directly applied to the dynamic graph, we propose a time alignment technique, called t-Alignment, to align the updating time steps of the temporal session graphs within a batch. Empirical results on three benchmark datasets show that GNG-ODE significantly outperforms other baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the user next action based on short and dynamic sessions. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in utilizing various elaborately designed graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the pair-wise relationships among items, seemingly suggesting the design of more complicated models is the panacea for improving the empirical performance. However, these models achieve relatively marginal improvements with exponential growth in model complexity. In this paper, we dissect the classical GNN-based SBR models and empirically find that some sophisticated GNN propagations are redundant, given the readout module plays a significant role in GNN-based models. Based on this observation, we intuitively propose to remove the GNN propagation part, while the readout module will take on more responsibility in the model reasoning process. To this end, we propose the Multi-Level Attention Mixture Network (Atten-Mixer), which leverages both concept-view and instance-view readouts to achieve multi-level reasoning over item transitions. As simply enumerating all possible high-level concepts is infeasible for large real-world recommender systems, we further incorporate SBR-related inductive biases, i.e., local invariance and inherent priority to prune the search space. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal. ",

    "abstract": "Recent research in Internet of things has been widely applied for industrial practices, fostering the exponential growth of data and connected devices. Henceforth, data-driven AI models would be accessed by different parties through certain data-sharing policies. However, most of the current training procedures rely on the centralized data-collection strategy and a single computational server. However, such a centralized scheme may lead to many issues. Customer data stored in a centralized database may be tampered with so the provenance and authenticity of data cannot be justified. Once the aforementioned security concerns occur, the credibility of the trained AI models would be questionable and even unfavorable outcomes might be produced at the test stage. Lately, blockchain and AI, the two core technologies in Industry 4.0 and Web 3.0, have been explored to facilitate the decentralized AI training strategy. To serve on this very purpose, we propose a new system architecture called APPFLChain, namely an integrated architecture of a Hyperledger Fabric-based blockchain and a federated-learning paradigm. Our proposed new system allows different parties to jointly train AI models and their customers or stakeholders are connected by a consortium blockchain-based network. Our new system can maintain a high degree of security and privacy as users do not need to share sensitive personal information to the server. For numerical evaluation, we simulate a real-world scenario to illustrate the whole operational process of APPFLChain. Simulation results show that taking advantage of the characteristics of consortium blockchain and federated learning, APPFLChain can demonstrate favorable properties including untamperability, traceability, privacy protection, and reliable decision-making.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a training method having multiple cyclic training for achieving enhanced performance in low-bit quantized convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Quantization is a popular method for obtaining lightweight CNNs, where the initialization with a pretrained model is widely used to overcome degraded performance in low-resolution quantization. However, large quantization errors between real values and their low-bit quantized ones cause difficulties in achieving acceptable performance for complex networks and large datasets. The proposed training method softly delivers the knowledge of pretrained models to low-bit quantized models in multiple quantization steps. In each quantization step, the trained weights of a model are used to initialize the weights of the next model with the quantization bit depth reduced by one. With small change of the quantization bit depth, the performance gap can be bridged, thus providing better weight initialization. In cyclic training, after training a low-bit quantized model, its trained weights are used in the initialization of its accurate model to be trained. By using better training ability of the accurate model in an iterative manner, the proposed method can produce enhanced trained weights for the low-bit quantized model in each cycle. Notably, the training method can advance Top-1 and Top-5 accuracies of the binarized ResNet-18 on the ImageNet dataset by 5.80% and 6.85%, respectively. ",

We observe that by instead initializing the weights into independent pairs, where each pair consists of two identical Gaussian vectors, we can significantly improve the convergence analysis.

Using this technique, we show how to significantly reduce the number of neurons required for two-layer ReLU networks, both in the under-parameterized setting with logistic loss, from roughly $\\gamma^{-8}$ [Ji and Telgarsky, ICLR 2020] to $\\gamma^{-2}$, where $\\gamma$ denotes the separation margin with a Neural Tangent Kernel, as well as in the over-parameterized setting with squared loss, from roughly $n^4$ [Song and Yang, 2019] to $n^2$, implicitly also improving the recent running time bound of [Brand, Peng, Song and Weinstein, ITCS 2021].

    "abstract": "The wide spread of fake news is increasingly threatening both individuals and society. Great efforts have been made for automatic fake news detection on a single domain (e.g., politics). However, correlations exist commonly across multiple news domains, and thus it is promising to simultaneously detect fake news of multiple domains. Based on our analysis, we pose two challenges in multi-domain fake news detection: 1) domain shift, caused by the discrepancy among domains in terms of words, emotions, styles, etc. 2) domain labeling incompleteness, stemming from the real-world categorization that only outputs one single domain label, regardless of topic diversity of a news piece. In this paper, we propose a Memory-guided Multi-view Multi-domain Fake News Detection Framework (M$^3$FEND) to address these two challenges. We model news pieces from a multi-view perspective, including semantics, emotion, and style. Specifically, we propose a Domain Memory Bank to enrich domain information which could discover potential domain labels based on seen news pieces and model domain characteristics. Then, with enriched domain information as input, a Domain Adapter could adaptively aggregate discriminative information from multiple views for news in various domains. Extensive offline experiments on English and Chinese datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of M$^3$FEND, and online tests verify its superiority in practice.

Most CF methods utilize an encoder to embed users and items into the same representation space, and the Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) loss is usually adopted as the objective function to learn informative encoders. Existing studies mainly focus on designing more powerful encoders (e.g., graph neural network) to learn better representations. However, few efforts have been devoted to investigating the desired properties of representations in CF, which is important to understand the rationale of existing CF methods and design new learning objectives. In this paper, we measure the representation quality in CF from the perspective of alignment and uniformity on the hypersphere. We first theoretically reveal the connection between the BPR loss and these two properties. Then, we empirically analyze the learning dynamics of typical CF methods in terms of quantified alignment and uniformity, which shows that better alignment or uniformity both contribute to higher recommendation performance. Based on the analyses results, a learning objective that directly optimizes these two properties is proposed, named DirectAU. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, and the proposed learning framework with a simple matrix factorization model leads to significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art CF methods.

Correspondingly, we also propose an efficient single pilot aided with minimum guard (SPA-MG) scheme to perform channel estimation in the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) domain. Furthermore, the message passing based iterative detector is explored for signal detection. Finally, the bit error ratio (BER) performances are simulated under doubly selective channels.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of estimating link flows in a road network by combining limited traffic volume and vehicle trajectory data. While traffic volume data from loop detectors have been the common data source for link flow estimation, the detectors only cover a subset of links. Vehicle trajectory data collected from vehicle tracking sensors are also incorporated these days. However, trajectory data are often sparse in that the observed trajectories only represent a small subset of the whole population, where the exact sampling rate is unknown and may vary over space and time. This study proposes a novel generative modelling framework, where we formulate the link-to-link movements of a vehicle as a sequential decision-making problem using the Markov Decision Process framework and train an agent to make sequential decisions to generate realistic synthetic vehicle trajectories. We use Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based methods to find the best behaviour of the agent, based on which synthetic population vehicle trajectories can be generated to estimate link flows across the whole network. To ensure the generated population vehicle trajectories are consistent with the observed traffic volume and trajectory data, two methods based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning and Constrained Reinforcement Learning are proposed. The proposed generative modelling framework solved by either of these RL-based methods is validated by solving the link flow estimation problem in a real road network. Additionally, we perform comprehensive experiments to compare the performance with two existing methods. The results show that the proposed framework has higher estimation accuracy and robustness under realistic scenarios where certain behavioural assumptions about drivers are not met or the network coverage and penetration rate of trajectory data are low.

    "abstract": "When designing clustering algorithms, the choice of initial centers is crucial for the quality of the learned clusters. In this paper, we develop a new initialization scheme, called HST initialization, for the $k$-median problem in the general metric space (e.g., discrete space induced by graphs), based on the construction of metric embedding tree structure of the data. From the tree, we propose a novel and efficient search algorithm, for good initial centers that can be used subsequently for the local search algorithm. Our proposed HST initialization can produce initial centers achieving lower errors than those from another popular initialization method, $k$-median++, with comparable efficiency. The HST initialization can also be extended to the setting of differential privacy (DP) to generate private initial centers. We show that the error from applying DP local search followed by our private HST initialization improves previous results on the approximation error, and approaches the lower bound within a small factor. Experiments justify the theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our approach can also be extended to the $k$-means problem. ",

    "abstract": "This work is concerned with discovering the governing partial differential equation (PDE) of a physical system. Existing methods have demonstrated the PDE identification from finite observations but failed to maintain satisfying performance against noisy data, partly owing to suboptimal estimated derivatives and found PDE coefficients. We address the issues by introducing a noise-aware physics-informed machine learning (nPIML) framework to discover the governing PDE from data following arbitrary distributions. Our proposals are twofold. First, we propose a couple of neural networks, namely solver and preselector, which yield an interpretable neural representation of the hidden physical constraint. After they are jointly trained, the solver network approximates potential candidates, e.g., partial derivatives, which are then fed to the sparse regression algorithm that initially unveils the most likely parsimonious PDE, decided according to the information criterion. Second, we propose the denoising physics-informed neural networks (dPINNs), based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), to deliver a set of the optimal finetuned PDE coefficients respecting the noise-reduced variables. The denoising PINNs' structures are compartmentalized into forefront projection networks and a PINN, by which the formerly learned solver initializes. Our extensive experiments on five canonical PDEs affirm that the proposed framework presents a robust and interpretable approach for PDE discovery, applicable to a wide range of systems, possibly complicated by noise.

    "abstract": "In many societal and industrial interactions, participants generally prefer their pure self-interest at the expense of the global welfare. Known as social dilemmas, this category of non-cooperative games offers situations where multiple actors should all cooperate to achieve the best outcome but greed and fear lead to a worst self-interested issue. Recently, the emergence of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has generated revived interest in social dilemmas with the introduction of Sequential Social Dilemma (SSD). Cooperative agents mixing RL policies and Tit-for-tat (TFT) strategies have successfully addressed some non-optimal Nash equilibrium issues. However, this kind of paradigm requires symmetrical and direct cooperation between actors, conditions that are not met when mutual cooperation become asymmetric and is possible only with at least a third actor in a circular way. To tackle this issue, this paper extends SSD with Circular Sequential Social Dilemma (CSSD), a new kind of Markov games that better generalizes the diversity of cooperation between agents. Secondly, to address such circular and asymmetric cooperation, we propose a candidate solution based on RL policies and a graph-based TFT. We conducted some experiments on a simple multi-player grid world which offers adaptable cooperation structures. Our work confirmed that our graph-based approach is beneficial to address circular situations by encouraging self-interested agents to reach mutual cooperation. ",

Many approaches investigate the reconstruction difference between normal and abnormal patterns, but neglect that anomalies do not necessarily correspond to large reconstruction errors. To address this issue, we design a Convolutional LSTM Auto-Encoder prediction framework with enhanced spatio-temporal memory exchange using bi-directionalilty and a higher-order mechanism. The bi-directional structure promotes learning the temporal regularity through forward and backward predictions. The unique higher-order mechanism further strengthens spatial information interaction between the encoder and the decoder. Considering the limited receptive fields in Convolutional LSTMs, we also introduce an attention module to highlight informative features for prediction. Anomalies are eventually identified by comparing the frames with their corresponding predictions. Evaluations on three popular benchmarks show that our framework outperforms most existing prediction-based anomaly detection methods. ",

    "abstract": "In the past couple of decades, significant research efforts are devoted to the prediction of software bugs (i.e., defects). These works leverage a diverse set of metrics, tools, and techniques to predict which classes, methods, lines, or commits are buggy. However, most existing work in this domain treats all bugs the same, which is not the case in practice. The more severe the bugs the higher their consequences. Therefore, it is important for a defect prediction method to estimate the severity of the identified bugs, so that the higher severity ones get immediate attention. In this paper, we provide a quantitative and qualitative study on two popular datasets (Defects4J and Bugs.jar), using 10 common source code metrics, and also two popular static analysis tools (SpotBugs and Infer) for analyzing their capability in predicting defects and their severity. We studied 3,358 buggy methods with different severity labels from 19 Java open-source projects. Results show that although code metrics are powerful in predicting the buggy code (Lines of the Code, Maintainable Index, FanOut, and Effort metrics are the best), they cannot estimate the severity level of the bugs. In addition, we observed that static analysis tools have weak performance in both predicting bugs (F1 score range of 3.1%-7.1%) and their severity label (F1 score under 2%). We also manually studied the characteristics of the severe bugs to identify possible reasons behind the weak performance of code metrics and static analysis tools in estimating the severity. Also, our categorization shows that Security bugs have high severity in most cases while Edge/Boundary faults have low severity. Finally, we show that code metrics and static analysis methods can be complementary in terms of estimating bug severity. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, several algorithms for system identification with neural state-space models have been introduced. Most of the proposed approaches are aimed at reducing the computational complexity of the learning problem, by splitting the optimization over short sub-sequences extracted from a longer training dataset. Different sequences are then processed simultaneously within a minibatch, taking advantage of modern parallel hardware for deep learning. An issue arising in these methods is the need to assign an initial state for each of the sub-sequences, which is required to run simulations and thus to evaluate the fitting loss. In this paper, we provide insights for calibration of neural state-space training algorithms based on extensive experimentation and analyses performed on two recognized system identification benchmarks. Particular focus is given to the choice and the role of the initial state estimation. We demonstrate that advanced initial state estimation techniques are really required to achieve high performance on certain classes of dynamical systems, while for asymptotically stable ones basic procedures such as zero or random initialization already yield competitive performance.

We introduce two encoder-decoder sub-networks that are fed with the blurry image and the estimated blur map, respectively, and produce as output the deblurred (deconvolved) image. Each sub-network presents several skip connections that allow data propagation from layers spread apart, and also inter-subnetwork skip connections that ease the communication between the modules. The network is trained with synthetically blur kernels that are augmented to emulate blur maps produced by existing blur estimation methods, and our experimental results show that our method works well when combined with a variety of blur estimation methods.

The extraction of information about the tongue movement requires us to efficiently process the whole sequence of images, not just as a single image. Several approaches have been suggested to process such a sequential image data. The classic neural network structure combines two-dimensional convolutional (2D-CNN) layers that process the images separately with recurrent layers (eg. an LSTM) on top of them to fuse the information along time. More recently, it was shown that one may also apply a 3D-CNN network that can extract information along both the spatial and the temporal axes in parallel, achieving a similar accuracy while being less time consuming. A third option is to apply the less well-known ConvLSTM layer type, which combines the advantages of LSTM and CNN layers by replacing matrix multiplication with the convolution operation. In this paper, we experimentally compared various combinations of the above mentions layer types for a silent speech interface task, and we obtained the best result with a hybrid model that consists of a combination of 3D-CNN and ConvLSTM layers. This hybrid network is slightly faster, smaller and more accurate than our previous 3D-CNN model. %with combination of (2+1)D CNN. ",

While numerous attack and defense techniques have been developed, this work investigates the robustness issue from a new angle: can we design a self-healing neural network that can automatically detect and fix the vulnerability issue by itself? A typical self-healing mechanism is the immune system of a human body. This biology-inspired idea has been used in many engineering designs but is rarely investigated in deep learning. This paper considers the post-training self-healing of a neural network, and proposes a closed-loop control formulation to automatically detect and fix the errors caused by various attacks or perturbations. We provide a margin-based analysis to explain how this formulation can improve the robustness of a classifier. To speed up the inference of the proposed self-healing network, we solve the control problem via improving the Pontryagin Maximum Principle-based solver. Lastly, we present an error estimation of the proposed framework for neural networks with nonlinear activation functions. We validate the performance on several network architectures against various perturbations. Since the self-healing method does not need a-priori information about data perturbations/attacks, it can handle a broad class of unforeseen perturbations. ",

To mitigate such instances, several models have been developed to detect hate and offensive speech. Since detecting hate and offensive speech in social media platforms could incorrectly exclude individuals from social media platforms, which can reduce trust, there is a need to create explainable and interpretable models. Thus, we build an explainable and interpretable high performance model based on the XGBoost algorithm, trained on Twitter data. For unbalanced Twitter data, XGboost outperformed the LSTM, AutoGluon, and ULMFiT models on hate speech detection with an F1 score of 0.75 compared to 0.38 and 0.37, and 0.38 respectively. When we down-sampled the data to three separate classes of approximately 5000 tweets, XGBoost performed better than LSTM, AutoGluon, and ULMFiT; with F1 scores for hate speech detection of 0.79 vs 0.69, 0.77, and 0.66 respectively. XGBoost also performed better than LSTM, AutoGluon, and ULMFiT in the down-sampled version for offensive speech detection with F1 score of 0.83 vs 0.88, 0.82, and 0.79 respectively.

To this end, we propose a novel method here, known as FlowX, to explain GNNs by identifying important message flows. To quantify the importance of flows, we propose to follow the philosophy of Shapley values from cooperative game theory. To tackle the complexity of computing all coalitions' marginal contributions, we propose an approximation scheme to compute Shapley-like values as initial assessments of further redistribution training.

In this paper, we study the problem of safety verification of UAM schedules in the face of vertiport closures. We first provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a given UAM schedule to be safe in the sense that, if a vertiport closure occurs, then all UAVs will be able to safely land at a backup landing site. Next, we convert these conditions to an efficient algorithm for verifying safety of a UAM schedule via a linear program by using properties of totally unimodular matrices. Our algorithm allows for uncertain travel time between UAM vertiports and scales quadratically with the number of scheduled UAVs. We demonstrate our algorithm on a UAM network with up to 1,000 UAVs.

    "abstract": "The memorization effect of deep neural networks (DNNs) plays a pivotal role in recent label noise learning methods. To exploit this effect, the model prediction-based methods have been widely adopted, which aim to exploit the outputs of DNNs in the early stage of learning to correct noisy labels. However, we observe that the model will make mistakes during label prediction, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. By contrast, the produced features in the early stage of learning show better robustness. Inspired by this observation, in this paper, we propose a novel feature embedding-based method for deep learning with label noise, termed LabEl NoiseDilution (LEND). To be specific, we first compute a similarity matrix based on current embedded features to capture the local structure of training data. Then, the noisy supervision signals carried by mislabeled data are overwhelmed by nearby correctly labeled ones (\\textit{i.e.}, label noise dilution), of which the effectiveness is guaranteed by the inherent robustness of feature embedding. Finally, the training data with diluted labels are further used to train a robust classifier. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets by comparing our LEND with several representative robust learning approaches. The results verify the effectiveness of our LEND. ",

    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks have been widely used for skeleton-based action recognition due to their excellent modeling ability of non-Euclidean data. As the graph convolution is a local operation, it can only utilize the short-range joint dependencies and short-term trajectory but fails to directly model the distant joints relations and long-range temporal information that are vital to distinguishing various actions. To solve this problem, we present a multi-scale spatial graph convolution (MS-GC) module and a multi-scale temporal graph convolution (MT-GC) module to enrich the receptive field of the model in spatial and temporal dimensions. Concretely, the MS-GC and MT-GC modules decompose the corresponding local graph convolution into a set of sub-graph convolution, forming a hierarchical residual architecture. Without introducing additional parameters, the features will be processed with a series of sub-graph convolutions, and each node could complete multiple spatial and temporal aggregations with its neighborhoods. The final equivalent receptive field is accordingly enlarged, which is capable of capturing both short- and long-range dependencies in spatial and temporal domains. By coupling these two modules as a basic block, we further propose a multi-scale spatial temporal graph convolutional network (MST-GCN), which stacks multiple blocks to learn effective motion representations for action recognition. The proposed MST-GCN achieves remarkable performance on three challenging benchmark datasets, NTU RGB+D, NTU-120 RGB+D and Kinetics-Skeleton, for skeleton-based action recognition. ",

    "title": "De-END: Decoder-driven Watermarking Network",
    "abstract": "With recent advances in machine learning, researchers are now able to solve traditional problems with new solutions. In the area of digital watermarking, deep-learning-based watermarking technique is being extensively studied. Most existing approaches adopt a similar encoder-driven scheme which we name END (Encoder-NoiseLayer-Decoder) architecture. In this paper, we revamp the architecture and creatively design a decoder-driven watermarking network dubbed De-END which greatly outperforms the existing END-based methods. The motivation for designing De-END originated from the potential drawback we discovered in END architecture: The encoder may embed redundant features that are not necessary for decoding, limiting the performance of the whole network. We conducted a detailed analysis and found that such limitations are caused by unsatisfactory coupling between the encoder and decoder in END. De-END addresses such drawbacks by adopting a Decoder-Encoder-Noiselayer-Decoder architecture. In De-END, the host image is firstly processed by the decoder to generate a latent feature map instead of being directly fed into the encoder. This latent feature map is concatenated to the original watermark message and then processed by the encoder. This change in design is crucial as it makes the feature of encoder and decoder directly shared thus the encoder and decoder are better coupled. We conducted extensive experiments and the results show that this framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) END-based deep learning watermarking both in visual quality and robustness. On the premise of the same decoder structure, the visual quality (measured by PSNR) of De-END improves by 1.6dB (45.16dB to 46.84dB), and extraction accuracy after JPEG compression (QF=50) distortion outperforms more than 4% (94.9% to 99.1%).

    "abstract": "Outsourcing anomaly detection to third-parties can allow data owners to overcome resource constraints (e.g., in lightweight IoT devices), facilitate collaborative analysis (e.g., under distributed or multi-party scenarios), and benefit from lower costs and specialized expertise (e.g., of Managed Security Service Providers). Despite such benefits, a data owner may feel reluctant to outsource anomaly detection without sufficient privacy protection. To that end, most existing privacy solutions would face a novel challenge, i.e., preserving privacy usually requires the difference between data entries to be eliminated or reduced, whereas anomaly detection critically depends on that difference. Such a conflict is recently resolved under a local analysis setting with trusted analysts (where no outsourcing is involved) through moving the focus of differential privacy (DP) guarantee from \"all\" to only \"benign\" entries. In this paper, we observe that such an approach is not directly applicable to the outsourcing setting, because data owners do not know which entries are \"benign\" prior to outsourcing, and hence cannot selectively apply DP on data entries. Therefore, we propose a novel iterative solution for the data owner to gradually \"disentangle\" the anomalous entries from the benign ones such that the third-party analyst can produce accurate anomaly results with sufficient DP guarantee. We design and implement our Differentially Private Outsourcing of Anomaly Detection (DPOAD) framework, and demonstrate its benefits over baseline Laplace and PainFree mechanisms through experiments with real data from different application domains.

    "abstract": "Process mining techniques enable analysts to identify and assess process improvement opportunities based on event logs. A common roadblock to process mining is that event logs may contain private information that cannot be used for analysis without consent. An approach to overcome this roadblock is to anonymize the event log so that no individual represented in the original log can be singled out based on the anonymized one. Differential privacy is an anonymization approach that provides this guarantee. A differentially private event log anonymization technique seeks to produce an anonymized log that is as similar as possible to the original one (high utility) while providing a required privacy guarantee. Existing event log anonymization techniques operate by injecting noise into the traces in the log (e.g., duplicating, perturbing, or filtering out some traces). Recent work on differential privacy has shown that a better privacy-utility tradeoff can be achieved by applying subsampling prior to noise injection. In other words, subsampling amplifies privacy. This paper proposes an event log anonymization approach called Libra that exploits this observation. Libra extracts multiple samples of traces from a log, independently injects noise, retains statistically relevant traces from each sample, and composes the samples to produce a differentially private log. An empirical evaluation shows that the proposed approach leads to a considerably higher utility for equivalent privacy guarantees relative to existing baselines. ",

A peripheral nervous system appears as a diffusively connected system of mathematical models of neuron models, and the system's period becomes shorter than the periods of each neural circuit. The stimuli in the conduction path that will address the myelin sheath that has lost its function are received by the axons and are conveyed externally to the target organ, aiming to solve the problem of decreased nerve conduction. In the NEURON simulation environment, one can create a neuron model and define biophysical events that take place within the system for study. In this environment, signal transmission between cells and dendrites is obtained graphically. The simulated potassium and sodium conductance are replicated adequately, and the electronic action potentials are quite comparable to those measured experimentally. In this work, we propose an analog and digital coupled neuron model comprising individual excitatory and inhibitory neural circuit blocks for a low-cost and energy-efficient system. Compared to digital design, our analog design performs in lower frequency but gives a 32.3\\% decreased energy efficiency. Thus, the resulting coupled analog hardware neuron model can be a proposed model for the simulation of reduced nerve conduction. As a result, the analog coupled neuron, (even with its greater design complexity) serious contender for the future development of a wearable sensor device that could help with Guillain-Barre syndrome and other neurologic diseases.

We consider a general adversarial decision making framework that encompasses (structured) bandit problems with adversarial rewards and reinforcement learning problems with adversarial dynamics. Our main result is to show -- via new upper and lower bounds -- that the Decision-Estimation Coefficient, a complexity measure introduced by Foster et al. in the stochastic counterpart to our setting, is necessary and sufficient to obtain low regret for adversarial decision making. However, compared to the stochastic setting, one must apply the Decision-Estimation Coefficient to the convex hull of the class of models (or, hypotheses) under consideration. This establishes that the price of accommodating adversarial rewards or dynamics is governed by the behavior of the model class under convexification, and recovers a number of existing results -- both positive and negative. En route to obtaining these guarantees, we provide new structural results that connect the Decision-Estimation Coefficient to variants of other well-known complexity measures, including the Information Ratio of Russo and Van Roy and the Exploration-by-Optimization objective of Lattimore and Gy\\\"{o}rgy.

Many of these algorithms pay attention to the interest of users, while ignore the influence of social relationships on user behaviors. Social relationships not only carry intrinsic information of similar consumption tastes or behaviors, but also imply the influence of individual to its neighbors. In this paper, we assume that social relationships and historical behaviors of users are related to the same factors. Based on this assumption, we propose an algorithm to focus on social relationships useful for recommendation systems through mutual constraints from both types of information. We test the performance of our algorithm on four types of users, including all users, active users, inactive users and cold-start users. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms benchmarks in four types of scenarios subject to recommendation accuracy and diversity metrics. We further design a randomization model to explore the contribution of social relationships to recommendation performance, and the result shows that the contribution of social relationships in the proposed algorithm depends on the coupling strength of social relationships and historical behaviors.

We take an alternative approach and attempt to detect adversarial examples in a post-deployment setting. We present a novel method for this task that works by analyzing an unseen example's output configuration, which is the set of predictions made by an ensemble's constituent trees. Our approach works with any additive tree ensemble and does not require training a separate model. We evaluate our approach on three different tree ensemble learners.

    "abstract": "Recently, Miller et al. showed that a model's in-distribution (ID) accuracy has a strong linear correlation with its out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy on several OOD benchmarks -- a phenomenon they dubbed ''accuracy-on-the-line''. While a useful tool for model selection (i.e., the model most likely to perform the best OOD is the one with highest ID accuracy), this fact does not help estimate the actual OOD performance of models without access to a labeled OOD validation set. In this paper, we show a similar but surprising phenomenon also holds for the agreement between pairs of neural network classifiers: whenever accuracy-on-the-line holds, we observe that the OOD agreement between the predictions of any two pairs of neural networks (with potentially different architectures) also observes a strong linear correlation with their ID agreement. Furthermore, we observe that the slope and bias of OOD vs ID agreement closely matches that of OOD vs ID accuracy. This phenomenon, which we call agreement-on-the-line, has important practical applications: without any labeled data, we can predict the OOD accuracy of classifiers}, since OOD agreement can be estimated with just unlabeled data. Our prediction algorithm outperforms previous methods both in shifts where agreement-on-the-line holds and, surprisingly, when accuracy is not on the line. This phenomenon also provides new insights into deep neural networks: unlike accuracy-on-the-line, agreement-on-the-line appears to only hold for neural network classifiers. ",

In this work, we move toward the answer with one more step by connecting zero stability and model performance. Specifically, we found that if a discrete solver of an ordinary differential equation is zero stable, the CNN corresponding to that solver performs well. We first give the interpretation of zero stability in the context of deep learning and then investigate the performance of existing first- and second-order CNNs under different zero-stable circumstances. Based on the preliminary observation, we provide a higher-order discretization to construct CNNs and then propose a zero-stable network (ZeroSNet). To guarantee zero stability of the ZeroSNet, we first deduce a structure that meets consistency conditions and then give a zero stable region of a training-free parameter. By analyzing the roots of a characteristic equation, we theoretically obtain the optimal coefficients of feature maps. Empirically, we present our results from three aspects: We provide extensive empirical evidence of different depth on different datasets to show that the moduli of the characteristic equation's roots are the keys for the performance of CNNs that require historical features; Our experiments show that ZeroSNet outperforms existing CNNs which is based on high-order discretization; ZeroSNets show better robustness against noises on the input.

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are capable of finding the solution for a given boundary value problem. We employ several ideas from the finite element method (FEM) to enhance the performance of existing PINNs in engineering problems. The main contribution of the current work is to promote using the spatial gradient of the primary variable as an output from separated neural networks. Later on, the strong form which has a higher order of derivatives is applied to the spatial gradients of the primary variable as the physical constraint. In addition, the so-called energy form of the problem is applied to the primary variable as an additional constraint for training. The proposed approach only required up to first-order derivatives to construct the physical loss functions. We discuss why this point is beneficial through various comparisons between different models. The mixed formulation-based PINNs and FE methods share some similarities. While the former minimizes the PDE and its energy form at given collocation points utilizing a complex nonlinear interpolation through a neural network, the latter does the same at element nodes with the help of shape functions. We focus on heterogeneous solids to show the capability of deep learning for predicting the solution in a complex environment under different boundary conditions. The performance of the proposed PINN model is checked against the solution from FEM on two prototype problems: elasticity and the Poisson equation (steady-state diffusion problem). We concluded that by properly designing the network architecture in PINN, the deep learning model has the potential to solve the unknowns in a heterogeneous domain without any available initial data from other sources. Finally, discussions are provided on the combination of PINN and FEM for a fast and accurate design of composite materials in future developments. ",

To this end, we first design effective poisoning attacks against representative trust prediction tools. The attacks are formulated as hard bi-level optimization problems, for which we propose several efficient approximation solutions. The resulting basic attacks would severely change the structural semantics (in particular, both local and global balance properties) of a signed graph, which makes the attacks prone to be detected by the powerful attack detectors we designed. To address this issue, we further refine the basic attacks by integrating some conflicting metrics as penalty terms into the objective function. The refined attacks become secrecy-aware: they can successfully evade attack detectors with high probability while sacrificing little attack performance. We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate that the basic attacks can severely disrupt trust prediction, the basic attacks could be easily detected, and the refined attacks can preserve attack performance while evading detection. Overall, our results significantly advance the knowledge in designing more practical attacks, reflecting more realistic threats to current trust prediction systems. ",

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm is performed on simple vectors storing the time passed to complete previous activities.

However, previous works mainly consider static, pair-wise interactions with limited relational reasoning. To promote more comprehensive interaction modeling and relational reasoning, we propose DynGroupNet, a dynamic-group-aware network, which can i) model time-varying interactions in highly dynamic scenes; ii) capture both pair-wise and group-wise interactions; and iii) reason both interaction strength and category without direct supervision. Based on DynGroupNet, we further design a prediction system to forecast socially plausible trajectories with dynamic relational reasoning. The proposed prediction system leverages the Gaussian mixture model, multiple sampling and prediction refinement to promote prediction diversity, training stability and trajectory smoothness, respectively. Extensive experiments show that: 1)DynGroupNet can capture time-varying group behaviors, infer time-varying interaction category and interaction strength during trajectory prediction without any relation supervision on physical simulation datasets; 2)DynGroupNet outperforms the state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods by a significant improvement of 22.6%/28.0%, 26.9%/34.9%, 5.1%/13.0% in ADE/FDE on the NBA, NFL Football and SDD datasets and achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the ETH-UCY dataset.

    "abstract": "Local representation learning has been a key challenge to promote the performance of the histopathological whole slide images analysis. The previous representation learning methods followed the supervised learning paradigm. However, manual annotation for large-scale WSIs is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Hence, the self-supervised contrastive learning has recently attracted intensive attention. The present contrastive learning methods treat each sample as a single class, which suffers from class collision problems, especially in the domain of histopathology image analysis. In this paper, we proposed a novel contrastive representation learning framework named Lesion-Aware Contrastive Learning (LACL) for histopathology whole slide image analysis. We built a lesion queue based on the memory bank structure to store the representations of different classes of WSIs, which allowed the contrastive model to selectively define the negative pairs during the training. Moreover, We designed a queue refinement strategy to purify the representations stored in the lesion queue. The experimental results demonstrate that LACL achieves the best performance in histopathology image representation learning on different datasets, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods under different WSI classification benchmarks.

In this work, a Cyber-Resilient Economic Dispatch (CRED) framework is presented to mitigate the destabilizing effect of LAAs while minimizing the overall operational cost by dynamically optimizing the frequency droop control gains of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs). The system frequency dynamics incorporating both LAAs and the IBR droop control are modeled. The system stability constraints are explicitly derived based on parametric sensitivities. To incorporate them into the CRED model and minimize the error of the sensitivity analysis, a recursive linearization method is further proposed. A distributionally robust approach is applied to account for the uncertainty associated with the LAA detection/parameter estimation. The overall performance of the proposed CRED model is demonstrated through simulations in a modified IEEE reliability test system. ",

Specifically, we address the issue of accurately predicting the probability of a future connection between two robots equipped with range-based measurement devices. Due to the limited range of the equipped sensors, edges in the network connection topology will be created or destroyed as the robots move with respect to one another. Accurately predicting the future existence of an edge, given imperfect state estimation and noisy actuation, is therefore a challenging task. An adaptive power series expansion (or APSE) algorithm is developed based on current estimates and control candidates. Such an algorithm applies the power series expansion formula of the quadratic positive form in a normal distribution. Finite-term approximation is made to realize the computational tractability. Further analyses are presented to show that the truncation error in the finite-term approximation can be theoretically reduced to a desired threshold by adaptively choosing the summation degree of the power series. Several sufficient conditions are rigorously derived as the selection principles. Finally, extensive simulation results and comparisons, with respect to both single and multi-robot cases, validate that a formally computed and therefore more accurate probability of future topology can help improve the performance of active planning under uncertainty.

    "abstract": "The increasing importance and consequent challenges of establishing indirect trusted relationships in highly dynamic social networks such as vehicular social networks (VSNs), are investigated in this paper. VSNs are mobile social networks that aim to create social links among travellers on the roads. Besides matching interests between two users, social trust is essential to successfully establish and nurture a social relationship. However, the unique characteristics of VSNs pose many challenges such as uncertainty, subjectivity and intransitivity to indirect social trust modelling. Furthermore, the current trust models in the literature inadequately address trust propagation in VSNs. We propose a novel indirect social trust model for VSNs using evolving graph theory and the Paillier cryptosystem. We consider the VSN as a highly dynamic social evolving graph where social ties among vehicles hold a trustworthiness factor that evolves over time. This factor is estimated based on the behaviours, opinions, distances, and communication metrics of the parties involved. Employing the homomorphic property of the Paillier cryptosystem, the proposed model targets the subjectivity problem when combining multiple opinions to establish an indirect trusted relationship. Through analysis of computational and communication complexities, we show the viability of the proposed model and the efficiency of its indirect trust computation algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Since spectrum below 6 GHz bands does not suffice to meet the high bandwidth requirements of 5G use cases, 5G networks expand their operation to mmWave bands with multi-GHz of available spectrum. However, operation at mmWave bands raises two challenges: high penetration loss and susceptibility to objects blocking the line-of-sight. As a remedy, transmitters point their antennas to their receivers using beamforming to contain the signal in the direction of the intended receiver. To avoid loss of connectivity due to blockers or other factors such as rain, users can be connected to multiple base stations (BS). While these two features, beamforming and multi-connectivity, can mitigate the challenges of mmWave bands, it is not trivial to find the optimal user association which can maintain the minimum rate requirements of the users. In this paper, we first formulate a throughput-maximizing user association scheme considering beamforming and multi-connectivity, and investigate the behavior of the optimal scheme to devise a simple, yet efficient heuristic that does not require global network information. Our proposal, dubbed beam-align, which only uses local information at a BS, performs close to the optimal in terms of per-user capacity and user satisfaction levels and has only polynomial complexity. Our numerical analysis shows that beam-align outperforms the frequently-used association schemes based on SNR. To investigate the performance of beam-align also under various challenging settings, we consider three scenarios: presence of blockers, different levels of rain intensity, and presence of clustered users. From simulations, we observe that beam-align is robust against different conditions, as it maintains a stable performance under the studied scenarios. ",

However, such metrics are heuristically built as an aggregate of multiple desirable aspects, introduce parameters and wipe out the interpretability of the output. In this article, we first highlight the limitations of the classical precision/recall, as well as the main issues of the recent event-based metrics -- for instance, we show that an adversary algorithm can reach high precision and recall on almost any dataset under weak assumption. To cope with the above problems, we propose a theoretically grounded, robust, parameter-free and interpretable extension to precision/recall metrics, based on the concept of ``affiliation'' between the ground truth and the prediction sets. Our metrics leverage measures of duration between ground truth and predictions, and have thus an intuitive interpretation. By further comparison against random sampling, we obtain a normalized precision/recall, quantifying how much a given set of results is better than a random baseline prediction. By construction, our approach keeps the evaluation local regarding ground truth events, enabling fine-grained visualization and interpretation of algorithmic results. We compare our proposal against various public time series anomaly detection datasets, algorithms and metrics. We further derive theoretical properties of the affiliation metrics that give explicit expectations about their behavior and ensure robustness against adversary strategies. ",

To date, most existing graph embedding methods either focus on plain graphs with only the graph topology, or consider properties on nodes only. We propose PGE, a graph representation learning framework that incorporates both node and edge properties into the graph embedding procedure. PGE uses node clustering to assign biases to differentiate neighbors of a node and leverages multiple data-driven matrices to aggregate the property information of neighbors sampled based on a biased strategy. PGE adopts the popular inductive model for neighborhood aggregation. We provide detailed analyses on the efficacy of our method and validate the performance of PGE by showing how PGE achieves better embedding results than the state-of-the-art graph embedding methods on benchmark applications such as node classification and link prediction over real-world datasets.

Thus, to further the understanding of unfairness in these settings, we propose a taxonomy to characterize bias in the data, and study cases where it is shaped by model behaviour.

They conclude that \"the graph neural network optimizer performs on par or outperforms existing solvers, with the ability to scale beyond the state of the art to problems with millions of variables.\" In this comment, we show that a simple greedy algorithm, running in almost linear time, can find solutions for the MIS problem of much better quality than the GNN. The greedy algorithm is faster by a factor of $10^4$ with respect to the GNN for problems with a million variables. We do not see any good reason for solving the MIS with these GNN, as well as for using a sledgehammer to crack nuts. In general, many claims of superiority of neural networks in solving combinatorial problems are at risk of being not solid enough, since we lack standard benchmarks based on really hard problems.

Existing works mainly focus on solving the second issue by designing attention-based models or introducing noisy external knowledge, while the first issue remains under-explored. In this paper, inspired by the potential capability of pre-trained language models (PLMs) serving as knowledge bases and few-shot learners, we propose to introduce prompt-based fine-tuning for stance detection. PLMs can provide essential contextual information for the targets and enable few-shot learning via prompts. Considering the crucial role of the target in stance detection task, we design target-aware prompts and propose a novel verbalizer. Instead of mapping each label to a concrete word, our verbalizer maps each label to a vector and picks the label that best captures the correlation between the stance and the target. Moreover, to alleviate the possible defect of dealing with varying targets with a single hand-crafted prompt, we propose to distill the information learned from multiple prompts. Experimental results show the superior performance of our proposed model in both full-data and few-shot scenarios. ",

With technology improving and many IoT wearables being put on the athletes to collect valuable data, there is a solid ground for applying machine learning (ML) techniques to improve every aspect of the game. The work presented here is the first attempt in predicting DPI using player tracking GPS data. The data we used was collected by NFL's Next Gen Stats throughout the 2018 regular season. We present ML models for highly imbalanced time-series binary classification: LSTM, GRU, ANN, and Multivariate LSTM-FCN. Results showed that using GPS tracking data to predict DPI has limited success. The best performing models had high recall with low precision which resulted in the classification of many false positive examples. Looking closely at the data confirmed that there is just not enough information to determine whether a foul was committed.

    "abstract": "Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) can help customers find more satisfying items in different domains. Existing CDR models mainly use common users or mapping functions as bridges between domains but have very limited exploration in fully utilizing extra knowledge across domains. In this paper, we propose to incorporate the knowledge graph (KG) for CDR, which enables items in different domains to share knowledge. To this end, we first construct a new dataset AmazonKG4CDR from the Freebase KG and a subset (two domain pairs: movies-music, movie-book) of Amazon Review Data. This new dataset facilitates linking knowledge to bridge within- and cross-domain items for CDR. Then we propose a new framework, KG-aware Neural Collective Matrix Factorization (KG-NeuCMF), leveraging KG to enrich item representations. It first learns item embeddings by graph convolutional autoencoder to capture both domain-specific and domain-general knowledge from adjacent and higher-order neighbours in the KG. Then, we maximize the mutual information between item embeddings learned from the KG and user-item matrix to establish cross-domain relationships for better CDR. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the newly constructed dataset and demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms the best-performing baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Depression is one of the most common mental disorders, which imposes heavy negative impacts on one's daily life. Diagnosing depression based on the interview is usually in the form of questions and answers. In this process, the audio signals and their text transcripts of a subject are correlated to depression cues and easily recorded. Therefore, it is feasible to build an Automatic Depression Detection (ADD) model based on the data of these modalities in practice. However, there are two major challenges that should be addressed for constructing an effective ADD model. The first challenge is the organization of the textual and audio data, which can be of various contents and lengths for different subjects. The second challenge is the lack of training samples due to the privacy concern. Targeting to these two challenges, we propose the TOpic ATtentive transformer-based ADD model, abbreviated as TOAT. To address the first challenge, in the TOAT model, topic is taken as the basic unit of the textual and audio data according to the question-answer form in a typical interviewing process. Based on that, a topic attention module is designed to learn the importance of of each topic, which helps the model better retrieve the depressed samples. To solve the issue of data scarcity, we introduce large pre-trained models, and the fine-tuning strategy is adopted based on the small-scale ADD training data. We also design a two-branch architecture with a late-fusion strategy for building the TOAT model, in which the textual and audio data are encoded independently. We evaluate our model on the multimodal DAIC-WOZ dataset specifically designed for the ADD task. Experimental results show the superiority of our method. More importantly, the ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the key elements in the TOAT model. ",

The current state-of-the-art is based on deep segmentation networks trained on large datasets. Per-pixel ground truth labeling of such datasets, however, is labor-intensive and expensive. We propose a new scaffolding learning regime (SLR), that leverages weak annotations consisting of water edge, horizon and obstacle bounding boxes to train segmentation-based obstacle detection networks, and thus reduces the required ground truth labelling effort by twenty-fold. SLR trains an initial model from weak annotations, then alternates between re-estimating the segmentation pseudo labels and improving the network parameters. Experiments show that maritime obstacle segmentation networks trained using SLR on weak labels not only match, but outperform the same networks trained with dense ground truth labels, which is a remarkable result. In addition to increased accuracy, SLR also increases domain generalization and can be used for domain adaptation with a low manual annotation load.

One of these challenges is the rapidly growing number of tourists in space limited regions such as historical city centers, museums or geographical bottlenecks like narrow valleys. In this context, a proper and accurate prediction of tourism volume and tourism flow within a certain area is important and critical for visitor management tasks such as visitor flow control and prevention of overcrowding. Static flow control methods like limiting access to hotspots or using conventional low level controllers could not solve the problem yet. In this paper, we empirically evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art deep-learning methods in the field of visitor flow prediction with limited data by using available granular data supplied by a tourism region and comparing the results to ARIMA, a classical statistical method. Our results show that deep-learning models yield better predictions compared to the ARIMA method, while both featuring faster inference times and being able to incorporate additional input features.

    "abstract": "Vehicular platooning is a promising way to facilitate efficient movement of vehicles with a shared route. Despite its relevance, the interplay of platooning and the communication performance in the resulting vehicular network (VN) is largely unexplored. Inspired by this, we develop a comprehensive approach to statistical modeling and system-level analysis of VNs with platooned traffic. Modeling the network of roads using the by-now well-accepted Poisson line process (PLP), we place vehicles on each road according to an independent Matern cluster process (MCP) that jointly captures randomness in the locations of platoons on the roads and vehicles within each platoon. The resulting triply-stochastic point process is a PLP-driven-Cox process, which we term the PLP-MCP. We first present this new point process's distribution and derive several fundamental properties essential for the resulting VN's analysis. Assuming that the cellular base-stations (BSs) are distributed as a Poisson point process (PPP), we derive the distribution of the loads served by the typical BS and the BS associated with the typical user. In deriving the latter, we also present a new approach to deriving the length distribution of a tagged chord in a Poisson Voronoi tessellation. Using the derived results, we present the rate coverage of the typical user while considering partial loading of the BSs. We also provide a comparative analysis of VNs with and without platooning of traffic. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the robust resource allocation design for secure communication in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. A multi-antenna dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) base station (BS) serves multiple single-antenna legitimate users and senses for targets simultaneously, where already identified targets are treated as potential single-antenna eavesdroppers. The DFRC BS scans a sector with a sequence of dedicated beams, and the ISAC system takes a snapshot of the environment during the transmission of each beam. Based on the sensing information, the DFRC BS can acquire the channel state information (CSI) of the potential eavesdroppers. Different from existing works that focused on the resource allocation design for a single snapshot, in this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework that jointly optimizes the communication and sensing resources over a sequence of snapshots with adjustable durations. To this end, we jointly optimize the duration of each snapshot, the beamforming vector, and the covariance matrix of the AN for maximization of the system sum secrecy rate over a sequence of snapshots while guaranteeing a minimum required average achievable rate and a maximum information leakage constraint for each legitimate user. The resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem, where we account for the imperfect CSI of both the legitimate users and the potential eavesdroppers. To make the problem tractable, we derive a bound for the uncertainty region of the potential eavesdroppers' small-scale fading based on a safe approximation, which facilitates the development of a block coordinate descent-based iterative algorithm for obtaining an efficient suboptimal solution.

This paper proposes a novel method for the automated recognition of thyroid nodules through an exhaustive exploration of ultrasound videos and key-frames.

Based on the localized key-frames, we develop a key-frame guided video classification model for thyroid nodule recognition. Besides, we introduce motion attention module to help network focus on significant frames in an ultrasound video, which is consistent with clinical diagnosis. The proposed thyroid nodule recognition framework is validated on clinically collected ultrasound videos, demonstrating superior performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods. ",

The dynamics of road users are modelled using Markov jump systems, in which the switching variable describes the desired lane of the vehicle under consideration. We assume the switching probabilities of the underlying Markov chain to be unknown. As the vehicle is observed and thus, samples from the Markov chain are drawn, the transition probabilities are estimated along with an ambiguity set which accounts for misestimations of these probabilities. Correspondingly, a distributionally robust optimal control problem is formulated over a scenario tree, and solved in receding horizon. As a result, a motion planning procedure is obtained which through observation of the target vehicle gradually becomes less conservative while avoiding overconfidence in estimates obtained from small sample sizes. We present an extensive numerical case study, comparing the effects of several different design aspects on the controller performance and safety. ",

In the second stage, we first retrieve the most similar code from the code repository for the target code based on semantic and lexical similarity. Then we use the trained Bash encoder to generate two vector representations. Finally, we fuse these two vector representations via the fusion layer and generate the code comment through the decoder. To show the competitiveness of our proposed method, we construct a high-quality corpus by combining the corpus shared in the previous NL2Bash study and the corpus shared in the NLC2CMD competition. This corpus contains 10,592 Bash codes and corresponding comments.

It is unsure whether out-of-distribution detection models reliant on deep neural networks are suitable for detecting domain shifts in medical imaging. Gaussian Processes can reliably separate in-distribution data points from out-of-distribution data points via their mathematical construction. Hence, we propose a parameter efficient Bayesian layer for hierarchical convolutional Gaussian Processes that incorporates Gaussian Processes operating in Wasserstein-2 space to reliably propagate uncertainty. This directly replaces convolving Gaussian Processes with a distance-preserving affine operator on distributions. Our experiments on brain tissue-segmentation show that the resulting architecture approaches the performance of well-established deterministic segmentation algorithms (U-Net), which has not been achieved with previous hierarchical Gaussian Processes. Moreover, by applying the same segmentation model to out-of-distribution data (i.e., images with pathology such as brain tumors), we show that our uncertainty estimates result in out-of-distribution detection that outperforms the capabilities of previous Bayesian networks and reconstruction-based approaches that learn normative distributions.

Second, we utilize the left-corner names that are displayed on each student's Zoom window and propose an improved OCR (optical character recognition) technique to automatically gather the ground truth for the student faces with dynamic positions. Third, we perform several experimental comparisons and optimizations to efficiently shorten the training and testing time required on teachers' PC. Our evaluation shows that iExam achieves high accuracy, 90.4% for real-time face detection and 98.4% for post-exam face recognition, while maintaining acceptable runtime performance.

    "abstract": "With the rise of attacks on online accounts in the past years, more and more services offer two-factor authentication for their users. Having factors out of two of the three categories something you know, something you have and something you are should ensure that an attacker cannot compromise two of them at once. Thus, an adversary should not be able to maliciously interact with one's account. However, this is only true if one considers a weak adversary. In particular, since most current solutions only authenticate a session and not individual transactions, they are noneffective if one's device is infected with malware. For online banking, the banking industry has long since identified the need for authenticating transactions. However, specifications of such authentication schemes are not public and implementation details vary wildly from bank to bank with most still being unable to protect against malware. In this work, we present a generic approach to tackle the problem of malicious account takeovers, even in the presence of malware. To this end, we define a new paradigm to improve two-factor authentication that involves the concepts of one-out-of-two security and transaction authentication. Web authentication schemes following this paradigm can protect security-critical transactions against manipulation, even if one of the factors is completely compromised. Analyzing existing authentication schemes, we find that they do not realize one-out-of-two security. We give a blueprint of how to design secure web authentication schemes in general. Based on this blueprint we propose FIDO2 With Two Displays (FIDO2D), a new web authentication scheme based on the FIDO2 standard and prove its security using Tamarin. We hope that our work inspires a new wave of more secure web authentication schemes, which protect security-critical transactions even against attacks with malware. ",

This framework compares a fixed candidate policy, which admits an efficient parameterization and can be evaluated at a low computational cost, against a fixed baseline policy, which is known to be stable but expensive to evaluate. We provide sufficient conditions for the closed-loop stability of the candidate policy in terms of the worst-case approximation error with respect to the baseline policy, and we show that these conditions can be checked by solving a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP). Additionally, we demonstrate that an outer approximation of the stability region of the candidate policy can be computed by solving an MILP. The proposed framework is sufficiently general to accommodate a broad range of candidate policies including ReLU Neural Networks (NNs), optimal solution maps of parametric quadratic programs, and Model Predictive Control (MPC) policies. We also present an open-source toolbox in Python based on the proposed framework, which allows for the easy verification of custom NN architectures and MPC formulations.

    "title": "Guillotine Regularization: Improving Deep Networks Generalization by  Removing their Head",
    "abstract": "One unexpected technique that emerged in recent years consists in training a Deep Network (DN) with a Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) method, and using this network on downstream tasks but with its last few layers entirely removed. This usually skimmed-over trick is actually critical for SSL methods to display competitive performances. For example, on ImageNet classification, more than 30 points of percentage can be gained that way. This is a little vexing, as one would hope that the network layer at which invariance is explicitly enforced by the SSL criterion during training (the last layer) should be the one to use for best generalization performance downstream. But it seems not to be, and this study sheds some light on why. This trick, which we name Guillotine Regularization (GR), is in fact a generically applicable form of regularization that has also been used to improve generalization performance in transfer learning scenarios. In this work, through theory and experiments, we formalize GR and identify the underlying reasons behind its success in SSL methods. Our study shows that the use of this trick is essential to SSL performance for two main reasons: (i) improper data-augmentations to define the positive pairs used during training, and/or (ii) suboptimal selection of the hyper-parameters of the SSL loss.

    "abstract": "Arbitrary-shaped scene text detection is a challenging task due to the variety of text changes in font, size, color, and orientation. Most existing regression based methods resort to regress the masks or contour points of text regions to model the text instances. However, regressing the complete masks requires high training complexity, and contour points are not sufficient to capture the details of highly curved texts. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel light-weight anchor-free text detection framework called TextDCT, which adopts the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to encode the text masks as compact vectors. Further, considering the imbalanced number of training samples among pyramid layers, we only employ a single-level head for top-down prediction. To model the multi-scale texts in a single-level head, we introduce a novel positive sampling strategy by treating the shrunk text region as positive samples, and design a feature awareness module (FAM) for spatial-awareness and scale-awareness by fusing rich contextual information and focusing on more significant features. Moreover, we propose a segmented non-maximum suppression (S-NMS) method that can filter low-quality mask regressions. Extensive experiments are conducted on four challenging datasets, which demonstrate our TextDCT obtains competitive performance on both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, TextDCT achieves F-measure of 85.1 at 17.2 frames per second (FPS) and F-measure of 84.9 at 15.1 FPS for CTW1500 and Total-Text datasets, respectively. ",

In particular, the conventional objective (cost) function employed during the training process of a VAE both quantifies the agreement between the input and output data records and ensures that the latent space representation of the input data record is statistically generated with an appropriate mean and standard deviation. After training, simulated data realizations are generated by decoding appropriate latent space points. Since, however, standard VAE:s trained on randomly rotated MNIST digits cannot reliably distinguish between different digit classes since the rotated input data is effectively compared to a similarly rotated output data record.

Existing VSD-related works have mainly relied on the visual system but paid less attention to the audio aspect, while, actually, our audio system is the most vital complementary part to our visual system. Also, audio-visual saliency detection (AVSD), one of the most representative research topics for mimicking human perceptual mechanisms, is currently in its infancy, and none of the existing survey papers have touched on it, especially from the perspective of saliency detection. Thus, the ultimate goal of this paper is to provide an extensive review to bridge the gap between audio-visual fusion and saliency detection. In addition, as another highlight of this review, we have provided a deep insight into key factors which could directly determine the performances of AVSD deep models, and we claim that the audio-visual consistency degree (AVC) -- a long-overlooked issue, can directly influence the effectiveness of using audio to benefit its visual counterpart when performing saliency detection. Moreover, in order to make the AVC issue more practical and valuable for future followers, we have newly equipped almost all existing publicly available AVSD datasets with additional frame-wise AVC labels. Based on these upgraded datasets, we have conducted extensive quantitative evaluations to ground our claim on the importance of AVC in the AVSD task. In a word, both our ideas and new sets serve as a convenient platform with preliminaries and guidelines, all of which are very potential to facilitate future works in promoting state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance further.

    "abstract": "It has been demonstrated that deep neural networks outperform traditional machine learning. However, deep networks lack generalisability, that is, they will not perform as good as in a new (testing) set drawn from a different distribution due to the domain shift. In order to tackle this known issue, several transfer learning approaches have been proposed, where the knowledge of a trained model is transferred into another to improve performance with different data. However, most of these approaches require additional training steps, or they suffer from catastrophic forgetting that occurs when a trained model has overwritten previously learnt knowledge. We address both problems with a novel transfer learning approach that uses network aggregation. We train dataset-specific networks together with an aggregation network in a unified framework. The loss function includes two main components: a task-specific loss (such as cross-entropy) and an aggregation loss. The proposed aggregation loss allows our model to learn how trained deep network parameters can be aggregated with an aggregation operator. We demonstrate that the proposed approach learns model aggregation at test time without any further training step, reducing the burden of transfer learning to a simple arithmetical operation. The proposed approach achieves comparable performance w.r.t. the baseline. Besides, if the aggregation operator has an inverse, we will show that our model also inherently allows for selective forgetting, i.e., the aggregated model can forget one of the datasets it was trained on, retaining information on the others.

Methods for assessing classifier robustness are therefore essential. In this work, we address the challenge of evaluating corruption robustness in a way that allows comparability and interpretability on a given dataset. We propose a test data augmentation method that uses a robustness distance $\\epsilon$ derived from the datasets minimal class separation distance. The resulting MSCR (mean statistical corruption robustness) metric allows a dataset-specific comparison of different classifiers with respect to their corruption robustness. The MSCR value is interpretable, as it represents the classifiers avoidable loss of accuracy due to statistical corruptions. On 2D and image data, we show that the metric reflects different levels of classifier robustness. Furthermore, we observe unexpected optima in classifiers robust accuracy through training and testing classifiers with different levels of noise. While researchers have frequently reported on a significant tradeoff on accuracy when training robust models, we strengthen the view that a tradeoff between accuracy and corruption robustness is not inherent. Our results indicate that robustness training through simple data augmentation can already slightly improve accuracy. ",

We leverage available RGB-D images and robot odometry to perform inter-frame feature map spatial registration. This information is then fused within recurrent deep learnt models, to improve their accuracy and robustness. We demonstrate that this can considerably improve the classification performance with our best performing spatial-temporal model (ST-Atte) achieving absolute performance improvements for intersection-over-union (IoU[%]) of 4.7 for crop-weed segmentation and 2.6 for fruit (sweet pepper) segmentation. Furthermore, we show that these approaches are robust to variable framerates and odometry errors, which are frequently observed in real-world applications. ",

To guide the model toward better explanations, techniques in explanation supervision - which add supervision signals on the model explanation - have started to show promising effects on improving both the generalizability as and intrinsic interpretability of Deep Neural Networks. However, the research on supervising explanations, especially in vision-based applications represented through saliency maps, is in its early stage due to several inherent challenges: 1) inaccuracy of the human explanation annotation boundary, 2) incompleteness of the human explanation annotation region, and 3) inconsistency of the data distribution between human annotation and model explanation maps. To address the challenges, we propose a generic RES framework for guiding visual explanation by developing a novel objective that handles inaccurate boundary, incomplete region, and inconsistent distribution of human annotations, with a theoretical justification on model generalizability. Extensive experiments on two real-world image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework on enhancing both the reasonability of the explanation and the performance of the backbone DNNs model.

Aiming at real applications, recent works mainly fall into the category of reducing the complexity by simplified calculations, at the expense of performance sacrifice. However, the complexity is still unsatisfactory with exponentially increasing complexity or required exponentiation operations. Furthermore, due to the inherent loopy structure, the existing BP detectors persistently encounter error floor in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, which becomes even worse with calculation approximation. This work aims at a revised BP detector, named {Belief-selective Propagation (BsP)} detector by selectively utilizing the \\emph{trusted} incoming messages with sufficiently large \\textit{a priori} probabilities for updates. Two proposed strategies: symbol-based truncation (ST) and edge-based simplification (ES) squeeze the complexity (orders lower than the Original-BP), while greatly relieving the error floor issue over a wide range of antenna and modulation combinations. For the $16$-QAM $8 \\times 4$ MIMO system, the $\\mathcal{B}(1,1)$ {BsP} detector achieves more than $4$\\,dB performance gain (@$\\text{BER}=10^{-4}$) with roughly $4$ orders lower complexity than the Original-BP detector.

    "abstract": "Gait plan is a procedure that is typically applied on the ground robots, e.g., quadrupedal robots; the tilt-rotor, a novel type of quadrotor with eight inputs, is not one of them. While controlling the tilt-rotor relying on feedback linearization, the tilting angles (inputs) are expected to change over-intensively, which may not be expected in the application. To help suppress the intensive change in the tilting angles, a gait plan procedure is introduced to the tilt-rotor before feedback linearization. The tilting angles are specified with time in advance by users rather than given by the control rule. However, based on this scenario, the decoupling matrix in feedback linearization can be singular for some attitudes, combinations of roll angle and pitch angle. It hinders the further application of the feedback linearization. With this concern, Two Color Map Theorem is established to maximize the acceptable attitude region, where the combinations of roll and pitch will give an invertible decoupling matrix. That theorem, however, over-restricts the choice of the tilting angles, which can rule out some feasible robust gaits. This paper gives the generalized Two Color Map Theorem; all the robust gaits can be found based on this generalized theorem. The robustness of three gaits that satisfy this generalized Two Color Map Theorem (while violating Two Color Map Theorem) are analyzed. The results show that Generalized Two Color Map Theorem completes the search for the robust gaits for a tilt-rotor. ",

However, such approaches require manual inspection, which can be overwhelming given the large number of discussions. To help open source communities deal with this problem, in this paper, we aim to compare six classical machine learning models with BERT to detect incivility in open source code review and issue discussions. Furthermore, we assess if adding contextual information improves the models' performance and how well the models perform in a cross-platform setting. We found that BERT performs better than classical machine learning models, with a best F1-score of 0.95. Furthermore, classical machine learning models tend to underperform to detect non-technical and civil discussions. Our results show that adding the contextual information to BERT did not improve its performance and that none of the analyzed classifiers had an outstanding performance in a cross-platform setting.

We leverage the textual posts on social media to extract and track users' vaccination stances in near real time by proposing a deep learning framework. To address the impact of linguistic features such as sarcasm and irony commonly used in vaccine-related discourses, we integrate into the framework the recent posts of a user's social network neighbours to help detect the user's genuine attitude. Based on our annotated dataset from Twitter, the models instantiated from our framework can increase the performance of attitude extraction by up to 23% compared to state-of-the-art text-only models.

We further show one practical use of our framework by validating the possibility to forecast a user's vaccine hesitancy changes with information perceived from social media. ",

Great efforts from both the academic and industrial communities have been devoted to brain graph representation learning in recent years. The isomorphic neural network (IsoNN) introduced recently can automatically learn the existence of sub-graph patterns in brain graphs, which is also the state-of-the-art brain graph representation learning method by this context so far. However, IsoNN fails to capture the orientations of sub-graph patterns, which may render the learned representations to be useless for many cases. In this paper, we propose a new Iso-CapsNet (Isomorphic Capsule Net) model by introducing the graph isomorphic capsules for effective brain graph representation learning. Based on the capsule dynamic routing, besides the subgraph pattern existence confidence scores, Iso-CapsNet can also learn other sub-graph rich properties, including position, size and orientation, for calculating the class-wise digit capsules. We have compared Iso-CapsNet with both classic and state-of-the-art brain graph representation approaches with extensive experiments on four brain graph benchmark datasets. The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of Iso-CapsNet, which can out-perform the baseline methods with significant improvements. ",

A snapshot ensembling collects models in the ensemble along a single training path. As it runs training only one time, the computational time is similar to the training of one model. However, the quality of models along the training path is different: typically, later models are better if no overfitting occurs. So, the models are of varying utility. Our method improves snapshot ensembling by selecting and weighting ensemble members along the training path. It relies on training-time likelihoods without looking at validation sample errors that standard stacking methods do.

The second is to remove the dependence on the hypothesis space. We present several examples, including ones for lasso and deep learning, in which our bounds are provably preferable. The experiments on real-world data and theoretical models demonstrate near-exponential improvements in various situations. To achieve these improvements, we do not require additional assumptions on the unknown distribution; instead, we only incorporate an observable and computable property of the training samples. A key technical innovation is an improved concentration bound for multinomial random variables that is of independent interest beyond robustness and generalization. ",

By settling on a particular texture for the objects in a scene, we ensure consistency between frames statelessly.

The largest datasets in radiology are available for screening mammography. Recent reports, including in high impact journals, document performance of deep models at or above that of trained radiologists. What is not yet known is whether performance of these trained models is robust and replicates across datasets. Here we evaluate performance of five published state-of-the-art models on four publicly available mammography datasets. The limited size of public datasets precludes retraining the model and so we are limited to evaluate those models that have been made available with pre-trained parameters. Where test data was available, we replicated published results. However, the trained models performed poorly on out-of-sample data, except when based on all four standard views of a mammographic exam. We conclude that future progress will depend on a concerted effort to make more diverse and larger mammography datasets publicly available. Meanwhile, results that are not accompanied by a release of trained models for independent validation should be judged cautiously. ",

Specifically, we compared CPC, wav2vec 2.0, and HuBert. First, frame-level AF probing tasks were implemented. Subsequently, phone-level end-to-end ASR systems for phoneme recognition tasks were implemented, and the performance on the frame-level AF probing task and the phone accuracy were correlated. Compared to the conventional speech representation MFCC, all SSL pre-trained speech representations captured more AF information, and achieved better phoneme recognition performance within and across languages, with HuBert performing best. The frame-level AF probing task is a good predictor of phoneme recognition performance, showing the importance of capturing AF information in the speech representations. Compared with MFCC, in the within-language scenario, the performance of these SSL speech pre-trained models on AF probing tasks achieved a maximum relative increase of 34.4%, and it resulted in the lowest PER of 10.2%. In the cross-language scenario, the maximum relative increase of 26.7% also resulted in the lowest PER of 23.0%. ",

We show that, for the same filter order, IIR GFs provide a better approximation to the desired spectral response and they also present the same level of approximation to a lower order GF due to their rational type filter response. Second, we propose an IIR GNN model to efficiently predict the presence of cyberattacks at the bus level. Finally, we evaluate the model under various cyberattacks at both sample-wise (SW) and bus-wise (BW) level, and compare the results with the existing architectures.

    "abstract": "Decision makers often want to identify the individuals for whom some intervention or treatment will be most effective in order to decide who to treat. In such cases, decision makers would ideally like to rank potential recipients of the treatment according to their individual causal effects. However, the historical data available to estimate the causal effects could be confounded, and as a result, accurately estimating the effects could be impossible. We propose a new and less restrictive assumption about historical data, called the ranking preservation assumption (RPA), under which the ranking of the individual effects can be consistently estimated even if the effects themselves cannot be accurately estimated. Importantly, we find that confounding can be helpful for the estimation of the causal-effect ranking when the confounding bias is larger for individuals with larger causal effects, and that even when this is not the case, any detrimental impact of confounding can be corrected with larger training data when the RPA is met. We then analytically show that the RPA can be met in a variety of scenarios, including common business applications such as online advertising and customer retention. We support this finding with an empirical example in the context of online advertising. The example also shows how to evaluate the decision making of a confounded model in practice. The main takeaway is that what might traditionally be considered \"good\" data for causal estimation (i.e., unconfounded data) may not be necessary to make good causal decisions, so treatment assignment methods may work better than we give them credit for in the presence of confounding.

For networks with O output units (e.g. an O-class classifier), however, the eNTK on N inputs is of size $NO \\times NO$, taking $O((NO)^2)$ memory and up to $O((NO)^3)$ computation. Most existing applications have therefore used one of a handful of approximations yielding $N \\times N$ kernel matrices, saving orders of magnitude of computation, but with limited to no justification. We prove that one such approximation, which we call \"sum of logits\", converges to the true eNTK at initialization for any network with a wide final \"readout\" layer. Our experiments demonstrate the quality of this approximation for various uses across a range of settings. ",

This also enables us to conduct sequential active learning, i.e. updating the model in a streaming regime, without needing to retrain the model with SGD after adding each new data point. Moreover, our querying strategy, which better understands how the model's predictions will change by adding new data points in comparison to the standard (\"myopic\") criteria, beats other look-ahead strategies by large margins, and achieves equal or better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets in pool-based active learning.

    "abstract": "Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) may hamper the functionalities of drugs, and in the worst scenario, they may lead to adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Predicting all DDIs is a challenging and critical problem. Most existing computational models integrate drug-centric information from different sources and leverage them as features in machine learning classifiers to predict DDIs. However, these models have a high chance of failure, especially for the new drugs when all the information is not available. This paper proposes a novel Hypergraph Neural Network (HyGNN) model based on only the SMILES string of drugs, available for any drug, for the DDI prediction problem. To capture the drug similarities, we create a hypergraph from drugs' chemical substructures extracted from the SMILES strings. Then, we develop HyGNN consisting of a novel attention-based hypergraph edge encoder to get the representation of drugs as hyperedges and a decoder to predict the interactions between drug pairs. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our model and compare it with several state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed HyGNN model effectively predicts DDIs and impressively outperforms the baselines with a maximum ROC-AUC and PR-AUC of 97.9% and 98.1%, respectively.

Scan statistics identify connected subgraphs that are interesting or unexpected through maximization of a likelihood ratio statistic; in particular, nonparametric scan statistics (NPSSs) identify subgraphs with a higher than expected proportion of individually significant nodes. However, we show that recently proposed NPSS methods are miscalibrated, failing to account for the maximization of the statistic over the multiplicity of subgraphs. This results in both reduced detection power for subtle signals, and low precision of the detected subgraph even for stronger signals. Thus we develop a new statistical approach to recalibrate NPSSs, correctly adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing and taking the underlying graph structure into account. While the recalibration, based on randomization testing, is computationally expensive, we propose both an efficient (approximate) algorithm and new, closed-form lower bounds (on the expected maximum proportion of significant nodes for subgraphs of a given size, under the null hypothesis of no anomalous patterns). These advances, along with the integration of recent core-tree decomposition methods, enable CNSS to scale to large real-world graphs, with substantial improvement in the accuracy of detected subgraphs. Extensive experiments on both semi-synthetic and real-world datasets are demonstrated to validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, in comparison with state-of-the-art counterparts. ",

These estimators coincide with each other when the number of model parameters is sufficiently small; however, there is a discrepancy between them in particular in the overparametrized region where the number of model parameters is larger than the data dimension. In this paper, we review the prediction errors and corresponding estimators, and discuss their differences.

The aggregated representation encodes the geometric structure of the underlying feature distribution, which is expected to contain valuable speaker-specific information that may not be represented by the commonly used statistical measures like mean and variance. The original transport-oriented feature aggregation is also extended to a weighted-frame version to incorporate the attention mechanism.

In this paper, we expand this methodology and propose constrained shortest-path models for challenging discrete variants of bilevel and robust optimization, where traditional methods (e.g., dualize-and-combine) are not applicable compared to their continuous counterparts. Specifically, we propose a framework that models problems as decision diagrams and introduces side constraints either as linear inequalities in the underlying polyhedral representation, or as state variables in shortest-path calculations. We show that the first case generalizes a common class of combinatorial bilevel problems where the follower's decisions are separable with respect to the leader's decisions. In this setting, the side constraints are indicator functions associated with arc flows, and we leverage polyhedral structure to derive an alternative single-level reformulation of the bilevel problem. The case where side constraints are incorporated as node states, in turn, generalizes classical robust optimization. For this scenario, we leverage network structure to derive an iterative augmenting state-space strategy akin to an L-shaped method. We evaluate both strategies on a bilevel competitive project selection problem and the robust traveling salesperson with time windows, observing considerable improvements in computational efficiency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods in the respective areas.

For AMP algorithms tailored to independent Gaussian entries, we show that their state evolutions hold over broadly defined generalized Wigner and white noise ensembles, including matrices with heavy-tailed entries and heterogeneous entrywise variances that may arise in data applications. For AMP algorithms tailored to rotational invariance in law, we show that their state evolutions hold over matrix ensembles whose eigenvector bases satisfy only sign and permutation invariances, including sensing matrices composed of subsampled Hadamard or Fourier transforms and diagonal operators. We establish these results via a simplified moment-method proof, reducing AMP universality to the study of products of random matrices and diagonal tensors along a tensor network. As a by-product of our analyses, we show that the aforementioned matrix ensembles satisfy a notion of asymptotic freeness with respect to such tensor networks, which parallels usual definitions of freeness for traces of matrix products.

The preliminary work presents a comparative analysis of the wavelet and MFCC-based state-of-the-art spoof detection techniques developed in these papers, respectively (Novoselov et al., 2016) (Alam et al., 2016a). The results on ASVspoof 2015 justify our inclination towards wavelet-based features instead of MFCC features. The experiments on the ASVspoof 2019 database show the lack of credibility of the traditional handcrafted features and give us more reason to progress towards using end-to-end deep neural networks and more recent techniques. We use Sincnet architecture as our baseline. We get E2E deep learning models, which we call WSTnet and CWTnet, respectively, by replacing the Sinc layer with the Wavelet Scattering and Continuous wavelet transform layers. The fusion model achieved 62% and 17% relative improvement over traditional handcrafted models and our Sincnet baseline when evaluated on the modern spoofing attacks in ASVspoof 2019. The final scale distribution and the number of scales used in CWTnet are far from optimal for the task at hand. So to solve this problem, we replaced the CWT layer with a Wavelet Deconvolution(WD) (Khan and Yener, 2018) layer in our CWTnet architecture. This layer calculates the Discrete-Continuous Wavelet Transform similar to the CWTnet but also optimizes the scale parameter using back-propagation. The WDnet model achieved 26% and 7% relative improvement over CWTnet and Sincnet models respectively when evaluated over ASVspoof 2019 dataset. This shows that more generalized features are extracted as compared to the features extracted by CWTnet as only the most important and relevant frequency regions are focused upon. ",

Our contributions are as follows: (i) We propose a Spinal Context Transformer (SCT), a deep-learning architecture suited for the analysis of repeated anatomical structures in medical imaging such as vertebral bodies (VBs). Unlike previous related methods, SCT considers all VBs as viewed in all available image modalities together, making predictions for each based on context from the rest of the spinal column and all available imaging modalities. (ii) We apply the architecture to a novel and important task: detecting spinal metastases and the related conditions of cord compression and vertebral fractures/collapse from multi-series spinal MR scans. This is done using annotations extracted from free-text radiological reports as opposed to bespoke annotation. However, the resulting model shows strong agreement with vertebral-level bespoke radiologist annotations on the test set. (iii) We also apply SCT to an existing problem: radiological grading of inter-vertebral discs (IVDs) in lumbar MR scans for common degenerative changes.We show that by considering the context of vertebral bodies in the image, SCT improves the accuracy for several gradings compared to previously published model.

    "abstract": "Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization has recently emerged as a powerful framework for robust estimation, enjoying good out-of-sample performance guarantees, well-understood regularization effects, and computationally tractable dual reformulations. In such framework, the estimator is obtained by minimizing the worst-case expected loss over all probability distributions which are close, in a Wasserstein sense, to the empirical distribution. In this paper, we propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust M-estimation framework to estimate an unknown parameter from noisy linear measurements, and we focus on the important and challenging task of analyzing the squared error performance of such estimators. Our study is carried out in the modern high-dimensional proportional regime, where both the ambient dimension and the number of samples go to infinity, at a proportional rate which encodes the under/over-parametrization of the problem. Under an isotropic Gaussian features assumption, we show that the squared error can be recover as the solution of a convex-concave optimization problem which, surprinsingly, involves at most four scalar variables. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to study this problem in the context of Wasserstein distributionally robust M-estimation. ",

    "abstract": "Photometric data-driven classification of supernovae becomes a challenge due to the appearance of real-time processing of big data in astronomy. Recent studies have demonstrated the superior quality of solutions based on various machine learning models. These models learn to classify supernova types using their light curves as inputs. Preprocessing these curves is a crucial step that significantly affects the final quality. In this talk, we study the application of multilayer perceptron (MLP), bayesian neural network (BNN), and normalizing flows (NF) to approximate observations for a single light curve. We use these approximations as inputs for supernovae classification models and demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art based on Gaussian processes applying to the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey light curves. MLP demonstrates similar quality as Gaussian processes and speed increase. Normalizing Flows exceeds Gaussian processes in terms of approximation quality as well. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we describe an approach for representation learning of audio signals for the task of COVID-19 detection. The raw audio samples are processed with a bank of 1-D convolutional filters that are parameterized as cosine modulated Gaussian functions. The choice of these kernels allows the interpretation of the filterbanks as smooth band-pass filters. The filtered outputs are pooled, log-compressed and used in a self-attention based relevance weighting mechanism. The relevance weighting emphasizes the key regions of the time-frequency decomposition that are important for the downstream task. The subsequent layers of the model consist of a recurrent architecture and the models are trained for a COVID-19 detection task. In our experiments on the Coswara data set, we show that the proposed model achieves significant performance improvements over the baseline system as well as other representation learning approaches. Further, the approach proposed is shown to be uniformly applicable for speech and breathing signals and for transfer learning from a larger data set. ",

    "abstract": "Computer-aided diagnosis for low-dose computed tomography (CT) based on deep learning has recently attracted attention as a first-line automatic testing tool because of its high accuracy and low radiation exposure. However, existing methods rely on supervised learning, imposing an additional burden to doctors for collecting disease data or annotating spatial labels for network training, consequently hindering their implementation. We propose a method based on a deep neural network for computer-aided diagnosis called virtual multi-view projection and reconstruction for unsupervised anomaly detection. Presumably, this is the first method that only requires data from healthy patients for training to identify three-dimensional (3D) regions containing any anomalies. The method has three key components. Unlike existing computer-aided diagnosis tools that use conventional CT slices as the network input, our method 1) improves the recognition of 3D lung structures by virtually projecting an extracted 3D lung region to obtain two-dimensional (2D) images from diverse views to serve as network inputs, 2) accommodates the input diversity gain for accurate anomaly detection, and 3) achieves 3D anomaly/disease localization through a novel 3D map restoration method using multiple 2D anomaly maps. The proposed method based on unsupervised learning improves the patient-level anomaly detection by 10% (area under the curve, 0.959) compared with a gold standard based on supervised learning (area under the curve, 0.848), and it localizes the anomaly region with 93% accuracy, demonstrating its high performance.

    "abstract": "Neural vocoders based on the generative adversarial neural network (GAN) have been widely used due to their fast inference speed and lightweight networks while generating high-quality speech waveforms. Since the perceptually important speech components are primarily concentrated in the low-frequency band, most of the GAN-based neural vocoders perform multi-scale analysis that evaluates downsampled speech waveforms. This multi-scale analysis helps the generator improve speech intelligibility. However, in preliminary experiments, we observed that the multi-scale analysis which focuses on the low-frequency band causes unintended artifacts, e.g., aliasing and imaging artifacts, and these artifacts degrade the synthesized speech waveform quality. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the relationship between these artifacts and GAN-based neural vocoders and propose a GAN-based neural vocoder, called Avocodo, that allows the synthesis of high-fidelity speech with reduced artifacts. We introduce two kinds of discriminators to evaluate waveforms in various perspectives: a collaborative multi-band discriminator and a sub-band discriminator. We also utilize a pseudo quadrature mirror filter bank to obtain downsampled multi-band waveforms while avoiding aliasing. The experimental results show that Avocodo outperforms conventional GAN-based neural vocoders in both speech and singing voice synthesis tasks and can synthesize artifact-free speech. Especially, Avocodo is even capable to reproduce high-quality waveforms of unseen speakers. ",

    "abstract": "We investigate a majority-vote model on two-layer multiplex networks with community structure. In our majority-vote model, the edges on each layer encode one type of social relationship and an individual changes their opinion based on the majority opinions of their neighbors in each layer. To capture the fact that different relationships often have different levels of importance, we introduce a layer-preference parameter, which determines the probability of a node to adopt an opinion when the node's neighborhoods on the two layers have different majority opinions. We construct our networks so that each node is a member of one community on each layer, and we consider situations in which nodes tend to have more connections with nodes from the same community than with nodes from different communities. We study the influence of the layer-preference parameter, the intralayer communities, and interlayer membership correlation on the steady-state behavior of our model using both direct numerical simulations and a mean-field approximation. We find three different types of steady-state behavior: a fully-mixed state, consensus states, and polarized states. We demonstrate that a stronger interlayer community correlation makes polarized steady states reachable for wider ranges of the other model parameters. We also show that different values of the layer-preference parameter result in qualitatively different phase diagrams for the mean opinions at steady states. ",

    "title": "DeStripe: A Self2Self Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Network with Unfolded  Hessian for Stripe Artifact Removal in Light-sheet Microscopy",
    "abstract": "Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is a cutting-edge volumetric imaging technique that allows for three-dimensional imaging of mesoscopic samples with decoupled illumination and detection paths. Although the selective excitation scheme of such a microscope provides intrinsic optical sectioning that minimizes out-of-focus fluorescence background and sample photodamage, it is prone to light absorption and scattering effects, which results in uneven illumination and striping artifacts in the images adversely. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose a blind stripe artifact removal algorithm in LSFM, called DeStripe, which combines a self-supervised spatio-spectral graph neural network with unfolded Hessian prior. Specifically, inspired by the desirable properties of Fourier transform in condensing striping information into isolated values in the frequency domain, DeStripe firstly localizes the potentially corrupted Fourier coefficients by exploiting the structural difference between unidirectional stripe artifacts and more isotropic foreground images. Affected Fourier coefficients can then be fed into a graph neural network for recovery, with a Hessian regularization unrolled to further ensure structures in the standard image space are well preserved. Since in realistic, stripe-free LSFM barely exists with a standard image acquisition protocol, DeStripe is equipped with a Self2Self denoising loss term, enabling artifact elimination without access to stripe-free ground truth images. Competitive experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of DeStripe in recovering corrupted biomarkers in LSFM with both synthetic and real stripe artifacts. ",
