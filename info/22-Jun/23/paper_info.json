    "title": "Identifying Electrocardiogram Abnormalities Using a  Handcrafted-Rule-Enhanced Neural Network",
    "abstract": "A large number of people suffer from life-threatening cardiac abnormalities, and electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is beneficial to determining whether an individual is at risk of such abnormalities. Automatic ECG classification methods, especially the deep learning based ones, have been proposed to detect cardiac abnormalities using ECG records, showing good potential to improve clinical diagnosis and help early prevention of cardiovascular diseases. However, the predictions of the known neural networks still do not satisfactorily meet the needs of clinicians, and this phenomenon suggests that some information used in clinical diagnosis may not be well captured and utilized by these methods. In this paper, we introduce some rules into convolutional neural networks, which help present clinical knowledge to deep learning based ECG analysis, in order to improve automated ECG diagnosis performance. Specifically, we propose a Handcrafted-Rule-enhanced Neural Network (called HRNN) for ECG classification with standard 12-lead ECG input, which consists of a rule inference module and a deep learning module. Experiments on two large-scale public ECG datasets show that our new approach considerably outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Further, our proposed approach not only can improve the diagnosis performance, but also can assist in detecting mislabelled ECG samples.

    "abstract": "A key to deciphering the inner workings of neural networks is understanding what a model has learned. Promising methods for discovering learned features are based on analyzing activation values, whereby current techniques focus on analyzing high activation values to reveal interesting features on a neuron level. However, analyzing high activation values limits layer-level concept discovery. We present a method that instead takes into account the entire activation distribution. By extracting similar activation profiles within the high-dimensional activation space of a neural network layer, we find groups of inputs that are treated similarly. These input groups represent neural activation patterns (NAPs) and can be used to visualize and interpret learned layer concepts. We release a framework with which NAPs can be extracted from pre-trained models and provide a visual introspection tool that can be used to analyze NAPs. We tested our method with a variety of networks and show how it complements existing methods for analyzing neural network activation values. ",

    "abstract": "Cognitive-Driven Development (CDD) is a coding design technique that aims to reduce the cognitive effort that developers place in understanding a given code unit (e.g., a class). By following CDD design practices, it is expected that the coding units to be smaller, and, thus, easier to maintain and evolve. However, it is so far unknown whether these smaller code units coded using CDD standards are, indeed, easier to understand. In this work we aim to assess to what CDD improves code readability. To achieve this goal, we conducted a two-phase study. We start by inviting professional software developers to vote (and justify their rationale) on the most readable pair of code snippets (from a set of 10 pairs); one of the pairs was coded using CDD practices. We received 133 answers. In the second phase, we applied the state-of-the art readability model on the 10-pairs of CDD-guided refactorings. We observed some conflicting results. On the one hand, developers perceived that seven (out of 10) CDD-guided refactorings were more readable than their counterparts; for two other CDD-guided refactorings, developers were undecided, while only in one of the CDD-guided refactorings, developers preferred the original code snippet. On the other hand, we noticed that only one CDD-guided refactorings have better performance readability, assessed by state-of-the-art readability models. Our results provide initial evidence that CDD could be an interesting approach for software design. ",

This social cognitive ability to predict human beliefs and intentions is more important than ever for ensuring safe human-robot interaction and collaboration. This paper uses the combined knowledge of Theory of Mind (ToM) and Object-Context Relations to investigate methods for enhancing collaboration between humans and autonomous systems in environments where verbal communication is prohibited. We propose a novel and challenging multimodal video dataset for assessing the capability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in predicting human belief states in an object-context scenario. The proposed dataset consists of precise labelling of human belief state ground-truth and multimodal inputs replicating all nonverbal communication inputs captured by human perception. We further evaluate our dataset with existing deep learning models and provide new insights into the effects of the various input modalities and object-context relations on the performance of the baseline models.

Research on physical backdoors is limited by access to large datasets containing real images of physical objects co-located with targets of classification. Building these datasets is time- and labor-intensive. This works seeks to address the challenge of accessibility for research on physical backdoor attacks. We hypothesize that there may be naturally occurring physically co-located objects already present in popular datasets such as ImageNet. Once identified, a careful relabeling of these data can transform them into training samples for physical backdoor attacks. We propose a method to scalably identify these subsets of potential triggers in existing datasets, along with the specific classes they can poison. We call these naturally occurring trigger-class subsets natural backdoor datasets. Our techniques successfully identify natural backdoors in widely-available datasets, and produce models behaviorally equivalent to those trained on manually curated datasets. We release our code to allow the research community to create their own datasets for research on physical backdoor attacks. ",

We construct the first $\\varepsilon$-emulators for planar graphs of near-linear size $\\tilde O(k/\\varepsilon^{O(1)})$. In terms of $k$, this is a dramatic improvement over the previous quadratic upper bound of Cheung, Goranci and Henzinger, and breaks below known quadratic lower bounds for exact emulators (the case when $\\varepsilon=0$). Moreover, our emulators can be computed in (near-)linear time, which lead to fast $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithms for basic optimization problems on planar graphs, including multiple-source shortest paths, minimum $(s,t)$-cut, graph diameter, and dynamic distace oracle.

    "abstract": "We focus on bridging domain discrepancy in lane detection among different scenarios to greatly reduce extra annotation and re-training costs for autonomous driving. Critical factors hinder the performance improvement of cross-domain lane detection that conventional methods only focus on pixel-wise loss while ignoring shape and position priors of lanes. To address the issue, we propose the Multi-level Domain Adaptation (MLDA) framework, a new perspective to handle cross-domain lane detection at three complementary semantic levels of pixel, instance and category. Specifically, at pixel level, we propose to apply cross-class confidence constraints in self-training to tackle the imbalanced confidence distribution of lane and background. At instance level, we go beyond pixels to treat segmented lanes as instances and facilitate discriminative features in target domain with triplet learning, which effectively rebuilds the semantic context of lanes and contributes to alleviating the feature confusion. At category level, we propose an adaptive inter-domain embedding module to utilize the position prior of lanes during adaptation. In two challenging datasets, ie TuSimple and CULane, our approach improves lane detection performance by a large margin with gains of 8.8% on accuracy and 7.4% on F1-score respectively, compared with state-of-the-art domain adaptation algorithms.

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases remain among the top contributors to human illness and death worldwide, among which many diseases produce epidemic waves of infection. The unavailability of specific drugs and ready-to-use vaccines to prevent most of these epidemics makes the situation worse. These force public health officials, health care providers, and policymakers to rely on early warning systems generated by reliable and accurate forecasts of epidemics. Accurate forecasts of epidemics can assist stakeholders in tailoring countermeasures, such as vaccination campaigns, staff scheduling, and resource allocation, to the situation at hand, which could translate to reductions in the impact of a disease. Unfortunately, most of these past epidemics (e.g., dengue, malaria, hepatitis, influenza, and most recent, Covid-19) exhibit nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics due to their spreading fluctuations based on seasonal-dependent variability and the nature of these epidemics. We analyze a wide variety of epidemic time series datasets using a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) based autoregressive neural network and call it EWNet. MODWT techniques effectively characterize non-stationary behavior and seasonal dependencies in the epidemic time series and improve the forecasting scheme of the autoregressive neural network in the proposed ensemble wavelet network framework. From a nonlinear time series viewpoint, we explore the asymptotic stationarity of the proposed EWNet model to show the asymptotic behavior of the associated Markov Chain. We also theoretically investigate the effect of learning stability and the choice of hidden neurons in the proposed EWNet model. From a practical perspective, we compare our proposed EWNet framework with several statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models that have been previously used for epidemic forecasting. ",

To avoid the trivial solution where the encoder generates constant vectors, we regularize the covariance matrix of the embeddings from different images by penalizing low rank solutions. By jointly minimizing the transformation invariance loss and covariance contrast loss, we get an encoder that is able to produce useful representations for downstream tasks. We analyze our method and show that it can be viewed as a variant of MoCo with an implicit memory bank of unlimited size at no extra memory cost. This makes our method perform better than alternative methods when using small batch sizes. TiCo can also be seen as a modification of Barlow Twins. By connecting the contrastive and redundancy-reduction methods together, TiCo gives us new insights into how joint embedding methods work. ",

Then, we propose a novel algorithm to find an adversarial attack which constitutes of a sequence of invocations of functions in a DeFi protocol with the optimized parameters for profits. We implemented our framework in a tool called FlashSyn. We run FlashSyn on 5 DeFi protocols that were victims to flash loan attacks and DeFi protocols from Damn Vulnerable DeFi challenges.

    "abstract": "Neural operators have gained significant attention recently due to their ability to approximate high-dimensional parametric maps between function spaces. At present, only parametric function approximation has been addressed in the neural operator literature. In this work we investigate incorporating parametric derivative information in neural operator training; this information can improve function approximations, additionally it can be used to improve the approximation of the derivative with respect to the parameter, which is often the key to scalable solution of high-dimensional outer-loop problems (e.g. Bayesian inverse problems). Parametric Jacobian information is formally intractable to incorporate due to its high-dimensionality, to address this concern we propose strategies based on reduced SVD, randomized sketching and the use of reduced basis surrogates. All of these strategies only require only $O(r)$ Jacobian actions to construct sample Jacobian data, and allow us to reduce the linear algebra and memory costs associated with the Jacobian training from the product of the input and output dimensions down to $O(r^2)$, where $r$ is the dimensionality associated with the dimension reduction technique. Numerical results for parametric PDE problems demonstrate that the addition of derivative information to the training problem can significantly improve the parametric map approximation, particularly given few data. When Jacobian actions are inexpensive compared to the parametric map, this information can be economically substituted for parametric map data. Additionally we show that Jacobian error approximations improve significantly with the introduction of Jacobian training data. This result opens the door to the use of derivative informed neural operators (DINOs) in outer-loop algorithms where they can amortize the additional training data cost via repeated evaluations. ",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks (ANNs), originally inspired by biological neural networks (BNNs), have achieved remarkable successes in many tasks such as visual representation learning. However, whether there exists semantic correlations/connections between the visual representations in ANNs and those in BNNs remains largely unexplored due to both the lack of an effective tool to link and couple two different domains, and the lack of a general and effective framework of representing the visual semantics in BNNs such as human functional brain networks (FBNs). To answer this question, we propose a novel computational framework, Synchronized Activations (Sync-ACT), to couple the visual representation spaces and semantics between ANNs and BNNs in human brain based on naturalistic functional magnetic resonance imaging (nfMRI) data. With this approach, we are able to semantically annotate the neurons in ANNs with biologically meaningful description derived from human brain imaging for the first time. We evaluated the Sync-ACT framework on two publicly available movie-watching nfMRI datasets. The experiments demonstrate a) the significant correlation and similarity of the semantics between the visual representations in FBNs and those in a variety of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models; b) the close relationship between CNN's visual representation similarity to BNNs and its performance in image classification tasks. Overall, our study introduces a general and effective paradigm to couple the ANNs and BNNs and provides novel insights for future studies such as brain-inspired artificial intelligence. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in the industrial inspection of textured surfaces-in the form of visual inspection-have made such inspections possible for efficient, flexible manufacturing systems. We propose an unsupervised feature memory rearrangement network (FMR-Net) to accurately detect various textural defects simultaneously. Consistent with mainstream methods, we adopt the idea of background reconstruction; however, we innovatively utilize artificial synthetic defects to enable the model to recognize anomalies, while traditional wisdom relies only on defect-free samples. First, we employ an encoding module to obtain multiscale features of the textured surface. Subsequently, a contrastive-learning-based memory feature module (CMFM) is proposed to obtain discriminative representations and construct a normal feature memory bank in the latent space, which can be employed as a substitute for defects and fast anomaly scores at the patch level. Next, a novel global feature rearrangement module (GFRM) is proposed to further suppress the reconstruction of residual defects. Finally, a decoding module utilizes the restored features to reconstruct the normal texture background. In addition, to improve inspection performance, a two-phase training strategy is utilized for accurate defect restoration refinement, and we exploit a multimodal inspection method to achieve noise-robust defect localization. We verify our method through extensive experiments and test its practical deployment in collaborative edge--cloud intelligent manufacturing scenarios by means of a multilevel detection method, demonstrating that FMR-Net exhibits state-of-the-art inspection accuracy and shows great potential for use in edge-computing-enabled smart industries.

    "abstract": "Algorithmic recourse aims to recommend an informative feedback to overturn an unfavorable machine learning decision. We introduce in this paper the Bayesian recourse, a model-agnostic recourse that minimizes the posterior probability odds ratio. Further, we present its min-max robust counterpart with the goal of hedging against future changes in the machine learning model parameters. The robust counterpart explicitly takes into account possible perturbations of the data in a Gaussian mixture ambiguity set prescribed using the optimal transport (Wasserstein) distance. We show that the resulting worst-case objective function can be decomposed into solving a series of two-dimensional optimization subproblems, and the min-max recourse finding problem is thus amenable to a gradient descent algorithm. Contrary to existing methods for generating robust recourses, the robust Bayesian recourse does not require a linear approximation step. The numerical experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed robust Bayesian recourse facing model shifts.

    "abstract": "Online social networks (OSNs) are threatened by Sybil attacks, which create fake accounts (also called Sybils) on OSNs and use them for various malicious activities. Therefore, Sybil detection is a fundamental task for OSN security. Most existing Sybil detection methods are based on the graph structure of OSNs, and various methods have been proposed recently. However, although almost all methods have been compared experimentally in terms of detection performance and noise robustness, theoretical understanding of them is still lacking. In this study, we show that existing graph-based Sybil detection methods can be interpreted in a unified framework of low-pass filtering. This framework enables us to theoretically compare and analyze each method from two perspectives: filter kernel properties and the spectrum of shift matrices. Our analysis reveals that the detection performance of each method depends on how well low-pass filtering can extract low frequency components and remove noisy high frequency components. Furthermore, on the basis of the analysis, we propose a novel Sybil detection method called SybilHeat. Numerical experiments on synthetic graphs and real social networks demonstrate that SybilHeat performs consistently well on graphs with various structural properties. This study lays a theoretical foundation for graph-based Sybil detection and leads to a better understanding of Sybil detection methods. ",

Recent studies bring proximity graph-based methods into practitioners' attention -- proximity graph-based methods outperform other solutions such as quantization, hashing, and tree-based ANN algorithm families. In current recommendation systems, data point insertions, deletions, and queries are streamed into the system in an online fashion as users and items change dynamically. As proximity graphs are constructed incrementally by inserting data points as new vertices into the graph, online insertions and queries are well-supported in proximity graph. However, a data point deletion incurs removing a vertex from the proximity graph index, while no proper graph index updating mechanisms are discussed in previous studies. To tackle the challenge, we propose an incremental proximity graph maintenance (IPGM) algorithm for online ANN. IPGM supports both vertex deletion and insertion on proximity graphs. Given a vertex deletion request, we thoroughly investigate solutions to update the connections of the vertex. The proposed updating scheme eliminates the performance drop in online ANN methods on proximity graphs, making the algorithm suitable for practical systems. ",

Specifically, an essential demand for on-device learning is to enable trained models to be quantized to various bit-widths based on the energy needs and heterogeneous hardware designs across the federation. In this work, we introduce multiple variants of federated averaging algorithm that train neural networks robust to quantization. Such networks can be quantized to various bit-widths with only limited reduction in full precision model accuracy. We perform extensive experiments on standard FL benchmarks to evaluate our proposed FedAvg variants for quantization robustness and provide a convergence analysis for our Quantization-Aware variants in FL.

Major drawbacks of these representations are the lack of well-defined surfaces and non-interactive rendering times, as wide and deep MLPs must be queried millions of times per single frame. These limitations have recently been singularly overcome, but managing to accomplish this simultaneously opens up new use cases. We present KiloNeuS, a new neural object representation that can be rendered in path-traced scenes at interactive frame rates.

We trained and implemented a named entity recognition (NER) task using the Flair NLP-framework. The training was conducted using three default Flair NER models with two differently-sized corpora. The Flair Embeddings model trained on the larger training corpus showed the best accuracy of 0.77. Our model is able to recognize six entity types: funding agency, grant number, individuals, university, corporation and miscellaneous. The model works more precise for some entity types than the others, thus, individuals and grant numbers showed very good F1-Score over 0.9.

Accompanying the Two Color Map Theorem, the tilting-angles are planned robustly and continuously. The designed gaits are robust to the change of the attitude. However, this is not a complete theory before further applying to the tracking simulation test. This paper further discusses some gaits following the Two Color Map Theorem and simulates a tracking problem for a tilt-rotor. A uniform circular moving reference is designed to be tracked by the tilt-rotor equipped with the designed robust gait and the feedback linearization controller. The gaits satisfying Two Color Map Theorem show the robustness. The results from the simulation show the success in tracking of the tilt-rotor. ",

    "abstract": "Shared travel has gradually become one of the hot topics discussed on social networking platforms such as Micro Blog. In a timely manner, deeper network community detection on the evaluation content of shared travel in social networks can effectively conduct research and analysis on the public opinion orientation related to shared travel, which has great application prospects. The existing community detection algorithms generally measure the similarity of nodes in the network from the perspective of spatial distance. This paper proposes a Community detection algorithm based on Textual content Similarity and sentimental Tendency (CTST), considering the network structure and node attributes at the same time. The content similarity and sentimental tendency of network community users are taken as node attributes, and on this basis, an undirected weighted network is constructed for community detection. This paper conducts experiments with actual data and analyzes the experimental results. It is found that the modularity of the community detection results is high and the effect is good. ",

The task is formulated as a binary classification problem as occurrence and absence of response after the presenter's textual speech. We use the BERT model as our classifier and investigate models with different textual contexts under causal and non-causal prediction settings. While the non-causal textual context, one sentence preceding and one sentence following the response event, can hugely improve the accuracy of predictions, we showed that longer textual contexts with causal settings attain UAR and $F1$-Score improvements matching and exceeding the non-causal textual context performance within the experimental evaluations on the OPUS and TED datasets.

Reliable detection mechanisms for such attacks, which have been tested with a robust cross-database protocol and unknown morphing tools still is a research challenge.

This network compares a bona fide or potentially morphed image with triplets of morphing and bona fide face images. Our results show that this new network cluster the data points, and assigns them to classes in order to obtain a lower equal error rate in a cross-database scenario sharing only small image numbers from an unknown database. Few-shot learning helps to boost the learning process.

We reached this approach of utilizing unsupervised anomaly detection through our experience of developing a computational support tool for executive coaching, which taught us the importance of providing interpretable results so that expert coaches can take both the results and contexts into account. The key idea behind this approach is to leave room for expert coaches to unleash their open-ended interpretations, rather than simplifying the nature of social interactions to well-defined problems that are tractable by conventional supervised algorithms. In addition, we found that this approach can be extended to nurturing novice coaches; by prompting them to interpret the results from the system, it can provide the coaches with educational opportunities. Although the applicability of this approach should be validated in other domains, we believe that the idea of leveraging unsupervised anomaly detection to construct AI-based interactive systems would shed light on another direction of human-AI communication.

Benefiting from the above design concept, AdvSmo will generate adversarial examples with strong transferability and solid evasiveness. Finally, compared to the four advanced black-box adversarial attack methods, for the eight target models, the results show that AdvSmo improves the average attack success rate by 9% on the CIFAR-10 and 16% on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset compared to the best of these attack methods.

    "abstract": "In cases such as digital enrolment via mobile and online services, identity document verification is critical in order to efficiently detect forgery and therefore build user trust in the digital world. In this paper, an authentication model for identity documents based on forgery detection of guilloche patterns is proposed. The proposed approach is made up of two steps: feature extraction and similarity measure between a pair of feature vectors of identity documents. The feature extraction step involves learning the similarity between a pair of identity documents via a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and ends by extracting highly discriminative features between them. While, the similarity measure step is applied to decide if a given identity document is authentic or forged. In this work, these two steps are combined together to achieve two objectives: (i) extracted features should have good anticollision (discriminative) capabilities to distinguish between a pair of identity documents belonging to different classes, (ii) checking out the conformity of the guilloche pattern of a given identity document and its similarity to the guilloche pattern of an authentic version of the same country. Experiments are conducted in order to analyze and identify the most proper parameters to achieve higher authentication performance. The experimental results are performed on the MIDV-2020 dataset. The results show the ability of the proposed approach to extract the relevant characteristics of the processed pair of identity documents in order to model the guilloche patterns, and thus distinguish them correctly.

We perform spectral analysis of the solutions and conclude that gradient flow graph convolutional models can induce a dynamics dominated by the graph high frequencies which is desirable for heterophilic datasets.

We develop a simple idea for interpreting the layer-by-layer construction of useful representations: the role of each layer is to reformat information to reduce the \"distance\" to the target outputs. We formalize this intuitive idea of \"distance\" by leveraging recent work on metric representational similarity, and show how it leads to a rich space of geometric concepts. With this framework, the layer-wise computation implemented by a deep neural network can be viewed as a path in a high-dimensional representation space. We develop tools to characterize the geometry of these in terms of distances, angles, and geodesics. We then ask three sets of questions of residual networks trained on CIFAR-10: (1) how straight are paths, and how does each layer contribute towards the target? (2) how do these properties emerge over training? and (3) how similar are the paths taken by wider versus deeper networks? We conclude by sketching additional ways that this kind of representational geometry can be used to understand and interpret network training, or to prescriptively improve network architectures to suit a task.

Subsequently, we use the derived objective functions to train the auto-encoder and the agent policy. Experiments show that our AEAIL performs superior compared to state-of-the-art methods in the MuJoCo environments. More importantly, AEAIL shows much better robustness when the expert demonstrations are noisy.

Thus, the crucial issue of existing weakly-supervised action localization methods is the limited supervision from the weak annotations for precise predictions. In this work, we propose a hierarchical mining strategy under video-level and snippet-level manners, i.e., hierarchical supervision and hierarchical consistency mining, to maximize the usage of the given annotations and prediction-wise consistency. To this end, a Hierarchical Mining Network (HiM-Net) is proposed. Concretely, it mines hierarchical supervision for classification in two grains: one is the video-level existence for ground truth categories captured by multiple instance learning; the other is the snippet-level inexistence for each negative-labeled category from the perspective of complementary labels, which is optimized by our proposed complementary label learning. As for hierarchical consistency, HiM-Net explores video-level co-action feature similarity and snippet-level foreground-background opposition, for discriminative representation learning and consistent foreground-background separation. Specifically, prediction variance is viewed as uncertainty to select the pairs with high consensus for proposed foreground-background collaborative learning. Comprehensive experimental results show that HiM-Net outperforms existing methods on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets with large margins by hierarchically mining the supervision and consistency.

Including many case notions can result in a very complex model. To cope with such complexity, this paper introduces a new approach to cluster similar case notions based on Markov Directly-Follow Multigraph, which is an extended version of the well-known Directly-Follow Graph supported by many industrial and academic process mining tools. This graph is used to calculate a similarity matrix for discovering clusters of similar case notions based on a threshold. A threshold tuning algorithm is also defined to identify sets of different clusters that can be discovered based on different levels of similarity. Thus, the cluster discovery will not rely on merely analysts' assumptions. The approach is implemented and released as a part of a python library, called processmining, and it is evaluated through a Purchase to Pay (P2P) object-centric event log file. Some discovered clusters are evaluated by discovering Directly Follow-Multigraph by flattening the log based on the clusters. The similarity between identified clusters is also evaluated by calculating the similarity between the behavior of the process models discovered for each case notion using inductive miner based on footprints conformance checking.

We propose HeteroSP, a tool for estimating story points from textual input of Agile software project issues. We select GPT2SP [12] and Deep-SE [8] as the baselines for comparison. First, from the analysis of the story point dataset [8], we conclude that software issues are actually a mixture of natural language sentences with quoted code snippets and have problems related to large-size vocabulary. Second, we provide a module to normalize the input text including words and code tokens of the software issues. Third, we design an algorithm to convert an input software issue to a graph with different types of nodes and edges. Fourth, we construct a heterogeneous graph neural networks model with the support of fastText [6] for constructing initial node embedding to learn and predict the story points of new issues. We did the comparison over three scenarios of estimation, including within project, cross-project within the repository, and cross-project cross repository with our baseline approaches. We achieve the average Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as 2.38, 2.61, and 2.63 for three scenarios. We outperform GPT2SP in 2/3 of the scenarios while outperforming Deep-SE in the most challenging scenario with significantly less amount of running time. We also compare our approaches with different homogeneous graph neural network models and the results show that the heterogeneous graph neural networks model outperforms the homogeneous models in story point estimation.

Here, we focus on the perspective of key stakeholders, namely social purpose organizations and the clients they serve. The Compass ontology presented here extends the Common Impact Data Standard by introducing new concepts related to key dimensions: the who (Stakeholder), the what (Need, Need Satisfier, Outcome), the how (Service, Event), and the contributions (tracking resources). The paper first introduces key stakeholders, services, outcomes, events, needs and need satisfiers, along with their definitions. Second, a subset of competency questions are presented to illustrate the types of questions key stakeholders have posed. Third, the extension's ability to answer questions is evaluated by presenting SPARQL queries executed on a Compass-based knowledge graph and analysing their results. ",

    "abstract": "Vision transformer (ViT) and its variants have achieved remarkable successes in various visual tasks. The key characteristic of these ViT models is to adopt different aggregation strategies of spatial patch information within the artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, there is still a key lack of unified representation of different ViT architectures for systematic understanding and assessment of model representation performance. Moreover, how those well-performing ViT ANNs are similar to real biological neural networks (BNNs) is largely unexplored. To answer these fundamental questions, we, for the first time, propose a unified and biologically-plausible relational graph representation of ViT models. Specifically, the proposed relational graph representation consists of two key sub-graphs: aggregation graph and affine graph. The former one considers ViT tokens as nodes and describes their spatial interaction, while the latter one regards network channels as nodes and reflects the information communication between channels. Using this unified relational graph representation, we found that: a) a sweet spot of the aggregation graph leads to ViTs with significantly improved predictive performance; b) the graph measures of clustering coefficient and average path length are two effective indicators of model prediction performance, especially when applying on the datasets with small samples; c) our findings are consistent across various ViT architectures and multiple datasets; d) the proposed relational graph representation of ViT has high similarity with real BNNs derived from brain science data. Overall, our work provides a novel unified and biologically-plausible paradigm for more interpretable and effective representation of ViT ANNs. ",

    "abstract": "Many of the key enabling technologies of the fifth-generation (5G), such as network slicing, spectrum sharing, and federated learning, rely on a centralized authority. This may lead to pitfalls in terms of security or single point of failure. Distributed ledger technology, specifically blockchain, is currently employed by different applications related to the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G to address the drawbacks of centralized systems. For this reason, mobile blockchain networks (MBNs) have recently attracted a great deal of attention. To add a transaction to the blockchain in MBNs, mobile or IoT users must perform various tasks like encryption, decryption, and mining. These tasks require energy and processing power, which impose limitations on mobile and IoT users' performance because they are usually battery powered and have a low processing power. One possible solution is to perform the tasks virtually on commodity servers provided by mobile edge computing (MEC) or cloud computing. To do so, all tasks needed to add a transaction to the blockchain can be treated as virtual blockchain functions that can be executed on commodity servers. We introduce a blockchain virtualization framework called blockchain function virtualization (BFV), through which all blockchain functions can be performed virtually by MEC or cloud computing. Furthermore, we describe applications of the BFV framework and resource allocation challenges brought by the BFV framework in mobile networks. In addition, to illustrate the advantages of BFV, we define an optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the energy consumption cost and maximize miners' rewards. Finally, simulation results show the performance of the proposed framework in terms of total energy consumption, transaction confirmation rate, and miners' average profit. ",

However, as in the simpler homogeneous GNN case, message-passing-based heterogeneous GNNs may struggle to balance between resisting the oversmoothing occuring in deep models and capturing long-range dependencies graph structured data. Moreover, the complexity of this trade-off is compounded in the heterogeneous graph case due to the disparate heterophily relationships between nodes of different types. To address these issues, we proposed a novel heterogeneous GNN architecture in which layers are derived from optimization steps that descend a novel relation-aware energy function. The corresponding minimizer is fully differentiable with respect to the energy function parameters, such that bilevel optimization can be applied to effectively learn a functional form whose minimum provides optimal node representations for subsequent classification tasks. In particular, this methodology allows us to model diverse heterophily relationships between different node types while avoiding oversmoothing effects. Experimental results on 8 heterogeneous graph benchmarks demonstrates that our proposed method can achieve competitive node classification accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "The relevance of code comprehension in a developer's daily work was recognized more than 40 years ago. Over the years, several studies have gathered evidence that developers do indeed invest a considerable amount of their daily work in code comprehension. Consequently, many studies were conducted to find out how developers could be supported during code comprehension and which code characteristics contribute to better comprehension. Today, such experiments are more common than ever. While this is great for advancing the field, the number of publications makes it difficult to keep an overview. Additionally, designing rigorous experiments with human participants is a challenging task, and the multitude of design decisions and options can make it difficult for researchers to select a suitable design. We therefore conducted a systematic mapping study of 95 source code comprehension experiments published between 1979 and 2019. By systematically structuring the design characteristics of code comprehension studies, we provide a basis for subsequent discussion of the huge diversity of design options in the face of a lack of basic research on their consequences and comparability. We describe what topics have been studied, as well as how these studies have been designed, conducted, and reported. Frequently chosen design options and deficiencies are pointed out. We conclude with five concrete action items that we as a research community should address moving forward to improve publications of code comprehension experiments. ",

This work focuses on the use of SafeML for time series data, and on reliability and robustness estimation of ML-forecasting methods using statistical distance measures. To this end, distance measures based on the Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) proposed in SafeML are explored to measure Statistical-Distance Dissimilarity (SDD) across time series. We then propose SDD-based Reliability Estimate (StaDRe) and SDD-based Robustness (StaDRo) measures. With the help of a clustering technique, the similarity between the statistical properties of data seen during training and the forecasts is identified.

Recent advances in deep learning and neural network-based optimization have contributed to the development of methods that can help solve control problems involving high-dimensional dynamical systems. In particular, the framework of neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) provides an efficient means to iteratively approximate continuous time control functions associated with analytically intractable and computationally demanding control tasks. Although neural ODE controllers have shown great potential in solving complex control problems, the understanding of the effects of hyperparameters such as network structure and optimizers on learning performance is still very limited. Our work aims at addressing some of these knowledge gaps to conduct efficient hyperparameter optimization. To this end, we first analyze how truncated and non-truncated backpropagation through time affect runtime performance and the ability of neural networks to learn optimal control functions. Using analytical and numerical methods, we then study the role of parameter initializations, optimizers, and neural-network architecture. Finally, we connect our results to the ability of neural ODE controllers to implicitly regularize control energy. ",

However, adapting to new environments and effectively leveraging previous knowledge remain significant challenges. We present variational causal dynamics (VCD), a structured world model that exploits the invariance of causal mechanisms across environments to achieve fast and modular adaptation. By causally factorising a transition model, VCD is able to identify reusable components across different environments. This is achieved by combining causal discovery and variational inference to learn a latent representation and transition model jointly in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we optimise the evidence lower bound jointly over a representation model and a transition model structured as a causal graphical model. In evaluations on simulated environments with state and image observations, we show that VCD is able to successfully identify causal variables, and to discover consistent causal structures across different environments. Moreover, given a small number of observations in a previously unseen, intervened environment, VCD is able to identify the sparse changes in the dynamics and to adapt efficiently. In doing so, VCD significantly extends the capabilities of the current state-of-the-art in latent world models while also comparing favourably in terms of prediction accuracy. ",

In this paper, we present a new PPML method based on secure multi-party interactive protocol, namely Multi-party Secure Broad Learning System (MSBLS), and derive security analysis of the method. The existing PPML methods generally cannot simultaneously meet multiple requirements such as security, accuracy, efficiency and application scope, but MSBLS achieves satisfactory results in these aspects. It uses interactive protocol and random mapping to generate the mapped features of data, and then uses efficient broad learning to train neural network classifier. This is the first privacy computing method that combines secure multi-party computing and neural network. Theoretically, this method can ensure that the accuracy of the model will not be reduced due to encryption, and the calculation speed is very fast.

However, little is known about the practical effect this sensitivity may have on downstream longitudinal analyses. We explore this gap in the literature through a timely case study: understanding shifts in depression during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that inclusion of only a small number of semantically-unstable features can promote significant changes in longitudinal estimates of our target outcome. At the same time, we demonstrate that a recently-introduced method for measuring semantic shift may be used to proactively identify failure points of language-based models and, in turn, improve predictive generalization.

We propose an alternative approach, called sharing pattern submodels, which make predictions that are a) robust to missing values at test time, b) maintains or improves the predictive power of pattern submodels, and c) has a short description enabling improved interpretability.

Therefore, prioritization and focus become critical, to spend their limited time on the highest risk vulnerabilities. In doing this, it is important for these organizations not only to understand the technical descriptions of the vulnerabilities, but also to gain insights into attackers' perspectives. In this work, we use machine learning and natural language processing techniques, as well as several publicly available data sets to provide an explainable mapping of vulnerabilities to attack techniques and threat actors. This work provides new security intelligence, by predicting which attack techniques are most likely to be used to exploit a given vulnerability and which threat actors are most likely to conduct the exploitation. Lack of labeled data and different vocabularies make mapping vulnerabilities to attack techniques at scale a challenging problem that cannot be addressed easily using supervised or unsupervised (similarity search) learning techniques. To solve this problem, we first map the vulnerabilities to a standard set of common weaknesses, and then common weaknesses to the attack techniques. This approach yields a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.95, an accuracy comparable with those reported for state-of-the-art systems. Our solution has been deployed to IBM Security X-Force Red Vulnerability Management Services, and in production since 2021.

This becomes increasingly complicated as $f$ itself becomes complicated. In this paper, we show that when modeling one-dimensional conditional densities with a neural network, $Z$ can be exactly and efficiently computed by letting the network represent the cumulative distribution function of a target density, and applying a generalized fundamental theorem of calculus. We also derive a fast algorithm for sampling from the resulting representation by the inverse transform method. By extending these principles to higher dimensions, we introduce the \\textbf{Neural Inverse Transform Sampler (NITS)}, a novel deep learning framework for modeling and sampling from general, multidimensional, compactly-supported probability densities. NITS is a highly expressive density estimator that boasts end-to-end differentiability, fast sampling, and exact and cheap likelihood evaluation.

    "title": "Optimal transport meets noisy label robust loss and MixUp regularization  for domain adaptation",
    "abstract": "It is common in computer vision to be confronted with domain shift: images which have the same class but different acquisition conditions. In domain adaptation (DA), one wants to classify unlabeled target images using source labeled images. Unfortunately, deep neural networks trained on a source training set perform poorly on target images which do not belong to the training domain. One strategy to improve these performances is to align the source and target image distributions in an embedded space using optimal transport (OT). However OT can cause negative transfer, i.e. aligning samples with different labels, which leads to overfitting especially in the presence of label shift between domains. In this work, we mitigate negative alignment by explaining it as a noisy label assignment to target images. We then mitigate its effect by appropriate regularization. We propose to couple the MixUp regularization \\citep{zhang2018mixup} with a loss that is robust to noisy labels in order to improve domain adaptation performance. We show in an extensive ablation study that a combination of the two techniques is critical to achieve improved performance. Finally, we evaluate our method, called \\textsc{mixunbot}, on several benchmarks and real-world DA problems. ",

    "abstract": "We consider an object pose estimation and model fitting problem, where - given a partial point cloud of an object - the goal is to estimate the object pose by fitting a CAD model to the sensor data. We solve this problem by combining (i) a semantic keypoint-based pose estimation model, (ii) a novel self-supervised training approach, and (iii) a certification procedure, that not only verifies whether the output produced by the model is correct or not, but also flags uniqueness of the produced solution. The semantic keypoint detector model is initially trained in simulation and does not perform well on real-data due to the domain gap. Our self-supervised training procedure uses a corrector and a certification module to improve the detector. The corrector module corrects the detected keypoints to compensate for the domain gap, and is implemented as a declarative layer, for which we develop a simple differentiation rule. The certification module declares whether the corrected output produced by the model is certifiable (i.e. correct) or not. At each iteration, the approach optimizes over the loss induced only by the certifiable input-output pairs. As training progresses, we see that the fraction of outputs that are certifiable increases, eventually reaching near $100\\%$ in many cases. We also introduce the notion of strong certifiability wherein the model can determine if the predicted object model fit is unique or not. The detected semantic keypoints help us implement this in the forward pass. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the corrector, the certification, and the proposed self-supervised training using the ShapeNet and YCB datasets, and show the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to fully supervised baselines while not requiring pose or keypoint supervision on real data.

In this paper, we aim to design a provably robust image retrieval model which keeps the most important evaluation metric Recall@1 invariant to adversarial perturbation. We propose the first 1-nearest neighbor (NN) image retrieval algorithm, RetrievalGuard, which is provably robust against adversarial perturbations within an $\\ell_2$ ball of calculable radius. The challenge is to design a provably robust algorithm that takes into consideration the 1-NN search and the high-dimensional nature of the embedding space. Algorithmically, given a base retrieval model and a query sample, we build a smoothed retrieval model by carefully analyzing the 1-NN search procedure in the high-dimensional embedding space. We show that the smoothed retrieval model has bounded Lipschitz constant and thus the retrieval score is invariant to $\\ell_2$ adversarial perturbations. Experiments on image retrieval tasks validate the robustness of our RetrievalGuard method. ",

    "abstract": "Glass surfaces are becoming increasingly ubiquitous as modern buildings tend to use a lot of glass panels. This however poses substantial challenges on the operations of autonomous systems such as robots, self-driving cars and drones, as the glass panels can become transparent obstacles to the navigation.Existing works attempt to exploit various cues, including glass boundary context or reflections, as a prior. However, they are all based on input RGB images.We observe that the transmission of 3D depth sensor light through glass surfaces often produces blank regions in the depth maps, which can offer additional insights to complement the RGB image features for glass surface detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for glass surface detection by incorporating RGB-D information, with two novel modules: (1) a cross-modal context mining (CCM) module to adaptively learn individual and mutual context features from RGB and depth information, and (2) a depth-missing aware attention (DAA) module to explicitly exploit spatial locations where missing depths occur to help detect the presence of glass surfaces. In addition, we propose a large-scale RGB-D glass surface detection dataset, called \\textit{RGB-D GSD}, for RGB-D glass surface detection. Our dataset comprises 3,009 real-world RGB-D glass surface images with precise annotations. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. ",

In this paper, we demonstrate that a learned discrete codebook prior in a small proxy space largely reduces the uncertainty and ambiguity of restoration mapping by casting blind face restoration as a code prediction task, while providing rich visual atoms for generating high-quality faces. Under this paradigm, we propose a Transformer-based prediction network, named CodeFormer, to model global composition and context of the low-quality faces for code prediction, enabling the discovery of natural faces that closely approximate the target faces even when the inputs are severely degraded. To enhance the adaptiveness for different degradation, we also propose a controllable feature transformation module that allows a flexible trade-off between fidelity and quality. Thanks to the expressive codebook prior and global modeling, CodeFormer outperforms state of the arts in both quality and fidelity, showing superior robustness to degradation. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of our method. ",

We argue that such methods could support clinicians in analyzing suspect cytokine profiles by matching them against CRS knowledge from past clinical studies, with the ultimate aim of swift CRS diagnosis.

    "abstract": "Objective: Electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) are two non-invasive bio-signals, which are widely used in human machine interface (HMI) technologies (EEG-HMI and EMG-HMI paradigm) for the rehabilitation of physically disabled people. Successful decoding of EEG and EMG signals into respective control command is a pivotal step in the rehabilitation process. Recently, several Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based architectures are proposed that directly map the raw time-series signal into decision space and the process of meaningful features extraction and classification are performed simultaneously. However, these networks are tailored to the learn the expected characteristics of the given bio-signal and are limited to single paradigm. In this work, we addressed the question that can we build a single architecture which is able to learn distinct features from different HMI paradigms and still successfully classify them. Approach: In this work, we introduce a single hybrid model called ConTraNet, which is based on CNN and Transformer architectures that is equally useful for EEG-HMI and EMG-HMI paradigms. ConTraNet uses CNN block to introduce inductive bias in the model and learn local dependencies, whereas the Transformer block uses the self-attention mechanism to learn the long-range dependencies in the signal, which are crucial for the classification of EEG and EMG signals. Main results: We evaluated and compared the ConTraNet with state-of-the-art methods on three publicly available datasets which belong to EEG-HMI and EMG-HMI paradigms. ConTraNet outperformed its counterparts in all the different category tasks (2-class, 3-class, 4-class, and 10-class decoding tasks). Significance: The results suggest that ConTraNet is robust to learn distinct features from different HMI paradigms and generalizes well as compared to the current state of the art algorithms. ",

Managing the pressures by controlling injection/extraction are challenging because of complex heterogeneity in the subsurface. The heterogeneity typically requires high-fidelity physics-based models to make predictions on CO$_2$ fate. Furthermore, characterizing the heterogeneity accurately is fraught with parametric uncertainty. Accounting for both, heterogeneity and uncertainty, makes this a computationally-intensive problem challenging for current reservoir simulators. To tackle this, we use differentiable programming with a full-physics model and machine learning to determine the fluid extraction rates that prevent over-pressurization at critical reservoir locations. We use DPFEHM framework, which has trustworthy physics based on the standard two-point flux finite volume discretization and is also automatically differentiable like machine learning models. Our physics-informed machine learning framework uses convolutional neural networks to learn an appropriate extraction rate based on the permeability field. We also perform a hyperparameter search to improve the model's accuracy. Training and testing scenarios are executed to evaluate the feasibility of using physics-informed machine learning to manage reservoir pressures. We constructed and tested a sufficiently accurate simulator that is 400000 times faster than the underlying physics-based simulator, allowing for near real-time analysis and robust uncertainty quantification.

Our approach frames the selection process as a minimization of a binary quadratic model with which we encode fitness and distance between members of a population, and we leverage a quantum annealing system to sample low energy solutions for the selection mechanism. We benchmark these quantum-enhanced algorithms against classical algorithms over various black-box objective functions, including the OneMax function, and functions from the IOHProfiler library for black-box optimization. We observe a performance gain in average number of generations to convergence for the quantum-enhanced elitist selection operator in comparison to classical on the OneMax function.

Methods: The CXR public database (n = 247) of the Japanese Society of Radiological Technology with various types and sizes of lung nodules was analyzed. Eight radiologists evaluated the CXR images with regard to the presence of lung nodules and nodule conspicuity. After radiologist review, the AI software processed and flagged the CXR with the highest probability of missed nodules. The calculated accuracy metrics were the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, false negative case number (FN), and the effect of different AI modes (automated/assisted) on the accuracy of nodule detection. Results: For radiologists, the average AUC value was 0.77 $\\pm$ 0.07, while the average FN was 52.63 $\\pm$ 17.53 (all studies) and 32 $\\pm$ 11.59 (studies containing a nodule of malignant etiology = 32% rate of missed malignant nodules). Both AI modes -- automated and assisted -- produced an average increase in sensitivity (by 14% and 12%) and of F1-score (5% and 6%) and a decrease in specificity (by 10% and 3%, respectively). Conclusions: Both AI modes flagged the pulmonary nodules missed by radiologists in a significant number of cases. AI as a second reader has a high potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and radiology workflow. AI might detect certain pulmonary nodules earlier than radiologists, with a potentially significant impact on patient outcomes. ",

We hypothesized that a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) classifier could learn effectively on a small fMRI training set. Methods : We trained a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) classifier on 100 graph-label pairs from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database. For comparison, we trained a Supervised Deep Learning (SDL) classifier on the same training set. Results : DRL significantly outperformed SDL, with a p-value of 2.4 x 10^(-7). DRL achieved superior results for a variety of classifier performance metrics, including an F1 score of 76, versus 67 for SDL. Whereas SDL quickly overfit the training data, DRL learned in a progressive manner that generalised to the separate testing set. Conclusion : DRL can learn to classify ASD versus NT in a data efficient manner, doing so for a small training set. Future work will involve optimizing the neural network for data efficiency and applying the approach to other fMRI data sets, namely for brain cancer patients. ",

    "abstract": "Visual systems of primates are the gold standard of robust perception. There is thus a general belief that mimicking the neural representations that underlie those systems will yield artificial visual systems that are adversarially robust. In this work, we develop a method for performing adversarial visual attacks directly on primate brain activity. We then leverage this method to demonstrate that the above-mentioned belief might not be well founded. Specifically, we report that the biological neurons that make up visual systems of primates exhibit susceptibility to adversarial perturbations that is comparable in magnitude to existing (robustly trained) artificial neural networks.

    "title": "Automatic Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection Using Artificial  Intelligence Methods with MRI Neuroimaging: A Review",
    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a brain condition characterized by diverse signs and symptoms that appear in early childhood. ASD is also associated with communication deficits and repetitive behavior in affected individuals. Various ASD detection methods have been developed, including neuroimaging modalities and psychological tests. Among these methods, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) imaging modalities are of paramount importance to physicians. Clinicians rely on MRI modalities to diagnose ASD accurately. The MRI modalities are non-invasive methods that include functional (fMRI) and structural (sMRI) neuroimaging methods. However, the process of diagnosing ASD with fMRI and sMRI for specialists is often laborious and time-consuming; therefore, several computer-aided design systems (CADS) based on artificial intelligence (AI) have been developed to assist the specialist physicians. Conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are the most popular schemes of AI used for diagnosing ASD. This study aims to review the automated detection of ASD using AI. We review several CADS that have been developed using ML techniques for the automated diagnosis of ASD using MRI modalities. There has been very limited work on the use of DL techniques to develop automated diagnostic models for ASD. A summary of the studies developed using DL is provided in the appendix. Then, the challenges encountered during the automated diagnosis of ASD using MRI and AI techniques are described in detail. Additionally, a graphical comparison of studies using ML and DL to diagnose ASD automatically is discussed. We conclude by suggesting future approaches to detecting ASDs using AI techniques and MRI neuroimaging. ",
