    "abstract": "With the latest advances in deep learning generative models, it has not taken long to take advantage of their remarkable performance in the area of time series. Deep neural networks used to work with time series depend heavily on the breadth and consistency of the datasets used in training. These types of characteristic are not usually abundant in the real world, where they are usually limited and often with privacy constraints that must be guaranteed. Therefore, an effective way is to increase the number of data using \\gls{da} techniques, either by adding noise or permutations and by generating new synthetic data. It is systematically review the current state-of-the-art in the area to provide an overview of all available algorithms and proposes a taxonomy of the most relevant researches. The efficiency of the different variants will be evaluated; as a vital part of the process, the different metrics to evaluate the performance and the main problems concerning each model will be analysed. The ultimate goal of this study is to provide a summary of the evolution and performance of areas that produce better results to guide future researchers in this field. ",

    "abstract": "Following the success of convolution on non-Euclidean space, the corresponding pooling approaches have also been validated on various tasks regarding graphs. However, because of the fixed compression quota and stepwise pooling design, these hierarchical pooling methods still suffer from local structure damage and suboptimal problem. In this work, inspired by structural entropy, we propose a hierarchical pooling approach, SEP, to tackle the two issues. Specifically, without assigning the layer-specific compression quota, a global optimization algorithm is designed to generate the cluster assignment matrices for pooling at once. Then, we present an illustration of the local structure damage from previous methods in the reconstruction of ring and grid synthetic graphs. In addition to SEP, we further design two classification models, SEP-G and SEP-N for graph classification and node classification, respectively. The results show that SEP outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification benchmarks and obtains superior performance on node classifications. ",

    "abstract": "Koopman operators model nonlinear dynamics as a linear dynamic system acting on a nonlinear function as the state. This nonstandard state is often called a Koopman observable and is usually approximated numerically by a superposition of functions drawn from a \\textit{dictionary}. A widely used algorithm, is \\textit{Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition}, where the dictionary functions are drawn from a fixed, homogeneous class of functions. Recently, deep learning combined with EDMD has been used to learn novel dictionary functions in an algorithm called deep dynamic mode decomposition (deepDMD). The learned representation both (1) accurately models and (2) scales well with the dimension of the original nonlinear system. In this paper we analyze the learned dictionaries from deepDMD and explore the theoretical basis for their strong performance. We discover a novel class of dictionary functions to approximate Koopman observables. Error analysis of these dictionary functions show they satisfy a property of subspace approximation, which we define as uniform finite approximate closure. We discover that structured mixing of heterogeneous dictionary functions drawn from different classes of nonlinear functions achieve the same accuracy and dimensional scaling as deepDMD. This mixed dictionary does so with an order of magnitude reduction in parameters, while maintaining geometric interpretability. Our results provide a hypothesis to explain the success of deep neural networks in learning numerical approximations to Koopman operators. ",

For large and complex power system networks with large numbers of variables and constraints, finding the optimal solution for real-time OPF in a timely manner requires a massive amount of computing power. This paper presents a new method to reduce the number of constraints in the original OPF problem using a graph neural network (GNN). GNN is an innovative machine learning model that utilizes features from nodes, edges, and network topology to maximize its performance. In this paper, we proposed a GNN model to predict which lines would be heavily loaded or congested with given load profiles and generation capacities. Only these critical lines will be monitored in an OPF problem, creating a reduced OPF (ROPF) problem. Significant saving in computing time is expected from the proposed ROPF model. A comprehensive analysis of predictions from the GNN model was also made. It is concluded that the application of GNN for ROPF is able to reduce computing time while retaining solution quality. ",

In this paper, we explore the problem of developing cyber resilient systems capable of mitigating the spread of SPM attacks. We begin with an in-depth study of a well-known self-propagating malware, WannaCry, and present a compartmental model called SIIDR that accurately captures the behavior observed in real-world attack traces. Next, we investigate ten cyber defense techniques, including existing edge and node hardening strategies, as well as newly developed methods based on reconfiguring network communication (NodeSplit) and isolating communities. We evaluate all defense strategies in detail using six real-world communication graphs collected from a large retail network and compare their performance across a wide range of attacks and network topologies. We show that several of these defenses are able to efficiently reduce the spread of SPM attacks modeled with SIIDR. For instance, given a strong attack that infects 97% of nodes when no defense is employed, strategically securing a small number of nodes (0.08%) reduces the infection footprint in one of the networks down to 1%.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D indoor scenes from 2D images is an important task in many computer vision and graphics applications. A main challenge in this task is that large texture-less areas in typical indoor scenes make existing methods struggle to produce satisfactory reconstruction results. We propose a new method, named NeuRIS, for high quality reconstruction of indoor scenes. The key idea of NeuRIS is to integrate estimated normal of indoor scenes as a prior in a neural rendering framework for reconstructing large texture-less shapes and, importantly, to do this in an adaptive manner to also enable the reconstruction of irregular shapes with fine details. Specifically, we evaluate the faithfulness of the normal priors on-the-fly by checking the multi-view consistency of reconstruction during the optimization process. Only the normal priors accepted as faithful will be utilized for 3D reconstruction, which typically happens in the regions of smooth shapes possibly with weak texture. However, for those regions with small objects or thin structures, for which the normal priors are usually unreliable, we will only rely on visual features of the input images, since such regions typically contain relatively rich visual features (e.g., shade changes and boundary contours). Extensive experiments show that NeuRIS significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction quality. ",

Although test-time augmentation (TTA) can be applied to any data modality, it has seen limited adoption in NLP due in part to the difficulty of identifying label-preserving transformations. In this paper, we present augmentation policies that yield significant accuracy improvements with language models. A key finding is that augmentation policy design -- for instance, the number of samples generated from a single, non-deterministic augmentation -- has a considerable impact on the benefit of TTA. Experiments across a binary classification task and dataset show that test-time augmentation can deliver consistent improvements over current state-of-the-art approaches. ",

Roughly speaking, in this work we reveal in the case of shallow ANNs that the converse inequality is also true. More formally, we prove that the norm of the equivalence class of ANN parameter vectors with the same realization function is, up to a multiplicative constant, bounded from above by the sum of powers of the Lipschitz norm of the ANN realization function (with the exponents $ 1/2 $ and $ 1 $). Moreover, we prove that this upper bound only holds when employing the Lipschitz norm but does neither hold for H\\\"older norms nor for Sobolev-Slobodeckij norms. Furthermore, we prove that this upper bound only holds for sums of powers of the Lipschitz norm with the exponents $ 1/2 $ and $ 1 $ but does not hold for the Lipschitz norm alone. ",

While modern hardware features improve the system performance significantly, they may create new attack surfaces for malicious people to extract sensitive information about users without physical access to the victim device. Although many previously exploited hardware and OS features were patched by OS developers and chip vendors, any feature that is accessible from userspace applications can be exploited to perform software-based side-channel attacks. In this paper, we present DF-SCA, which is a software-based dynamic frequency side-channel attack on Linux and Android OS devices. We exploit unprivileged access to cpufreq interface that exposes real-time CPU core frequency values directly correlated with the system utilization, creating a reliable side-channel for attackers. We show that Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) feature in modern systems can be utilized to perform website fingerprinting attacks for Google Chrome and Tor browsers on modern Intel, AMD, and ARM architectures. We further extend our analysis to a wide selection of scaling governors on Intel and AMD CPUs, verifying that all scaling governors provide enough information on the visited web page. Moreover, we extract properties of keystroke patterns on frequency readings, that leads to 95% accuracy to distinguish the keystrokes from other activities on Android phones. We leverage inter-keystroke timings of a user by training a k-th nearest neighbor model, which achieves 88% password recovery rate in the first guess on Bank of America application. Finally, we propose several countermeasures to mask the user activity to mitigate DF-SCA on Linux-based systems. ",

Such datasets are often small in size, expensive to collect and annotate, and might involve privacy issues, which hinders our ability to train large, state-of-the-art deep learning models for biomedical applications. For time-series data, the suite of data augmentation strategies we can use to expand the size of the dataset is limited by the need to maintain the basic properties of the signal. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be utilized as another data augmentation tool. In this paper, we present TTS-CGAN, a transformer-based conditional GAN model that can be trained on existing multi-class datasets and generate class-specific synthetic time-series sequences of arbitrary length. We elaborate on the model architecture and design strategies. Synthetic sequences generated by our model are indistinguishable from real ones, and can be used to complement or replace real signals of the same type, thus achieving the goal of data augmentation. To evaluate the quality of the generated data, we modify the wavelet coherence metric to be able to compare the similarity between two sets of signals, and also conduct a case study where a mix of synthetic and real data are used to train a deep learning model for sequence classification. Together with other visualization techniques and qualitative evaluation approaches, we demonstrate that TTS-CGAN generated synthetic data are similar to real data, and that our model performs better than the other state-of-the-art GAN models built for time-series data generation.

This paper proposes a learning-based VM selection strategy that selects appropriate VMs for migration without direct host overloading detection.

    "abstract": "While deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved impressive classification performance in closed-world learning scenarios, they typically fail to generalize to unseen categories in dynamic open-world environments, in which the number of concepts is unbounded. In contrast, human and animal learners have the ability to incrementally update their knowledge by recognizing and adapting to novel observations. In particular, humans characterize concepts via exclusive (unique) sets of essential features, which are used for both recognizing known classes and identifying novelty. Inspired by natural learners, we introduce a Sparse High-level-Exclusive, Low-level-Shared feature representation (SHELS) that simultaneously encourages learning exclusive sets of high-level features and essential, shared low-level features. The exclusivity of the high-level features enables the DNN to automatically detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data, while the efficient use of capacity via sparse low-level features permits accommodating new knowledge. The resulting approach uses OOD detection to perform class-incremental continual learning without known class boundaries. We show that using SHELS for novelty detection results in statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art OOD detection approaches over a variety of benchmark datasets. Further, we demonstrate that the SHELS model mitigates catastrophic forgetting in a class-incremental learning setting,enabling a combined novelty detection and accommodation framework that supports learning in open-world settings ",

    "abstract": "In this note, we study the prescribed-time (PT) synchronization of multiweighted and directed complex networks (MWDCNs) via pinning control. Unlike finite-time and fixed-time synchronization, the time for synchronization can be preset as needed, which is independent of initial values and parameters like coupling strength. First and foremost, we reveal the essence of PT stability by improper integral, L'Hospital rule and Taylor expansion theory. Many controllers established previously for PT stability can be included in our new model. Then, we apply this new result on MWDCNs as an application. The synchronization error at the prescribed time is discussed carefully, so, PT synchronization can be reached. The network topology can be directed and disconnected, which means that the outer coupling matrices (OCMs) can be asymmetric and not connected. The relationships between nodes are allowed to be cooperative or competitive, so elements in OCMs and inner coupling matrices (ICMs) can be positive or negative. We use the rearranging variables' order technique to combine ICMs and OCMs together to get the sum matrices, which can make a bridge between multiweighted and single-weighted networks. Finally, simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our theory. ",

    "abstract": "Complicated underwater environments bring new challenges to object detection, such as unbalanced light conditions, low contrast, occlusion, and mimicry of aquatic organisms. Under these circumstances, the objects captured by the underwater camera will become vague, and the generic detectors often fail on these vague objects. This work aims to solve the problem from two perspectives: uncertainty modeling and hard example mining. We propose a two-stage underwater detector named boosting R-CNN, which comprises three key components. First, a new region proposal network named RetinaRPN is proposed, which provides high-quality proposals and considers objectness and IoU prediction for uncertainty to model the object prior probability. Second, the probabilistic inference pipeline is introduced to combine the first-stage prior uncertainty and the second-stage classification score to model the final detection score. Finally, we propose a new hard example mining method named boosting reweighting. Specifically, when the region proposal network miscalculates the object prior probability for a sample, boosting reweighting will increase the classification loss of the sample in the R-CNN head during training, while reducing the loss of easy samples with accurately estimated priors. Thus, a robust detection head in the second stage can be obtained. During the inference stage, the R-CNN has the capability to rectify the error of the first stage to improve the performance. Comprehensive experiments on two underwater datasets and two generic object detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. ",

Compared with other Machine Learning (ML) modalities, the acceleration of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is more challenging due to the irregularity and heterogeneity derived from graph typologies. Existing efforts, however, have focused mainly on handling graphs' irregularity and have not studied their heterogeneity. To this end we propose H-GCN, a PL (Programmable Logic) and AIE (AI Engine) based hybrid accelerator that leverages the emerging heterogeneity of Xilinx Versal Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platforms (ACAPs) to achieve high-performance GNN inference. In particular, H-GCN partitions each graph into three subgraphs based on its inherent heterogeneity, and processes them using PL and AIE, respectively. To further improve performance, we explore the sparsity support of AIE and develop an efficient density-aware method to automatically map tiles of sparse matrix-matrix multiplication (SpMM) onto the systolic tensor array.

Extracting phrases, on the other hand, is not commonly done due to inherent complications when extracting phrases, the most significant complication being that of double-counting, where words or phrases are counted when they appear inside longer phrases that themselves are also counted. Several papers have been written on phrase mining that describe solutions to this issue; however, they either require a list of so-called quality phrases to be available to the extracting process, or they require human interaction to identify those quality phrases during the process. We present a method that eliminates double-counting without the need to identify lists of quality phrases. In the context of a set of texts, we define a principal phrase as a phrase that does not cross punctuation marks, does not start with a stop word, with the exception of the stop words \"not\" and \"no\", does not end with a stop word, is frequent within those texts without being double counted, and is meaningful to the user. Our method can identify such principal phrases independently without human input, and enables their extraction from any texts. An R package called phm has been developed that implements this method.

However, accurately predicting product compatibility is difficult due to the heterogeneous product data and the lack of manually curated training data.

We develop AMRule, a multi-view rule discovery framework that can (1) adaptively and iteratively discover novel rulers that can complement the current weakly-supervised model to improve compatibility prediction; (2) discover interpretable rules from both structured attribute tables and unstructured product descriptions. AMRule adaptively discovers labeling rules from large-error instances via a boosting-style strategy, the high-quality rules can remedy the current model's weak spots and refine the model iteratively. For rule discovery from structured product attributes, we generate composable high-order rules from decision trees; and for rule discovery from unstructured product descriptions, we generate prompt-based rules from a pre-trained language model.

We propose a viable solution to implement the outdoor-to-indoor mmWave communication system with the aid of an active intelligent transmitting surface (active-ITS), where the active-ITS allows the incoming signal from an outdoor base station (BS) to pass through the surface and be received by the indoor user-equipments (UEs) after shifting its phase and magnifying its amplitude. Then, the problem of joint precoding of the BS and active-ITS is investigated to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) of the communication system. An efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) based algorithm is developed to solve it with the suboptimal solutions in nearly closed-forms. In addition, to reduce the size and hardware cost of an active-ITS, we provide a block-amplifying architecture to partially remove the circuit components for power-amplifying, where multiple transmissive-type elements (TEs) in each block share a same power amplifier. Simulations indicate that active-ITS has the potential of achieving a given performance with much fewer TEs compared to the passive-ITS under the same total system power consumption, which makes it suitable for application to the size-limited and aesthetic-needed scenario, and the inevitable performance degradation caused by the block-amplifying architecture is acceptable.

The arising signed graphs typically contain a clear community structure in the sense that the graph can be partitioned into a small number of polarized communities, each defining a sparse cut and indivisible into smaller polarized sub-communities. We provide a local clustering oracle for signed graphs with such a clear community structure, that can answer membership queries, i.e., \"Given a vertex $v$, which community does $v$ belong to?\", in sublinear time by reading only a small portion of the graph. Formally, when the graph has bounded maximum degree and the number of communities is at most $O(\\log n)$, then with $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}\\operatorname{poly}(1/\\varepsilon))$ preprocessing time, our oracle can answer each membership query in $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n}\\operatorname{poly}(1/\\varepsilon))$ time, and it correctly classifies a $(1-\\varepsilon)$-fraction of vertices w.r.t. a set of hidden planted ground-truth communities. Our oracle is desirable in applications where the clustering information is needed for only a small number of vertices. Previously, such local clustering oracles were only known for unsigned graphs; our generalization to signed graphs requires a number of new ideas and gives a novel spectral analysis of the behavior of random walks with signs. We evaluate our algorithm for constructing such an oracle and answering membership queries on both synthetic and real-world datasets, validating its performance in practice. ",

Along this line, existing methods usually assume that the graph structure (or the adjacency matrix), which determines the aggregation manner of graph neural network, is fixed either by definition or self-learning. However, the interactions of variables can be dynamic and evolutionary in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the interactions of time series are quite different if they are observed at different time scales. To equip the graph neural network with a flexible and practical graph structure, in this paper, we investigate how to model the evolutionary and multi-scale interactions of time series. In particular, we first provide a hierarchical graph structure cooperated with the dilated convolution to capture the scale-specific correlations among time series. Then, a series of adjacency matrices are constructed under a recurrent manner to represent the evolving correlations at each layer. Moreover, a unified neural network is provided to integrate the components above to get the final prediction. In this way, we can capture the pair-wise correlations and temporal dependency simultaneously. Finally, experiments on both single-step and multi-step forecasting tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art approaches. ",

This is an extremely complex problem to solve, as training a model requires large amounts of data, which are difficult to obtain if the deepfake generation method is too recent. Moreover, continuously retraining a network would be unfeasible. In this paper, we ask ourselves if, among the various deep learning techniques, there is one that is able to generalise the concept of deepfake to such an extent that it does not remain tied to one or more specific deepfake generation methods used in the training set. We compared a Vision Transformer with an EfficientNetV2 on a cross-forgery context based on the ForgeryNet dataset. From our experiments, It emerges that EfficientNetV2 has a greater tendency to specialize often obtaining better results on training methods while Vision Transformers exhibit a superior generalization ability that makes them more competent even on images generated with new methodologies.

In this paper, we propose a novel CSI sensing scheme that can significantly reduce the feedback overhead. Our scheme involves a novel parameter dimension reduction design by exploiting the spatial consistency of wireless channels among nearby UEs, and a constrained PR (CPR) formulation that characterizes the feasible region of CSI by the PMI information. To address the computational challenge due to the non-convexity and the large number of constraints of CPR, we develop a two-stage algorithm that firstly identifies and removes inactive constraints, followed by a fast first-order algorithm. The study is further extended to multi-carrier systems. Extensive tests over DeepMIMO and QuaDriGa datasets showcase that our designs greatly outperform existing methods and achieve the high-resolution Type-II codebook performance with a few rounds of feedback.

With the growth of sample amounts, training of classification algorithms becomes more and more expensive. In addition, training data sets may contain redundant or noisy instances. The problem to be solved is how to select representative instances from large training data sets without reducing the accuracy. This work presents a new parallel instance selection algorithm called Parallel Instance Filtering (PIF). The main idea of the algorithm is to split the data set into non-overlapping subsets of instances covering the whole data set and apply a filtering process for each subset. Each subset consists of instances that have the same nearest enemy. As a result, the PIF algorithm is fast since subsets are processed independently of each other using parallel computation. We compare the PIF algorithm with several state-of-the-art instance selection algorithms on a large data set of 500,000 malicious and benign samples. The feature set was extracted using static analysis, and it includes metadata from the portable executable file format. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed instance selection algorithm reduces the size of a training data set significantly with the only slightly decreased accuracy. The PIF algorithm outperforms existing instance selection methods used in the experiments in terms of the ratio between average classification accuracy and storage percentage. ",

    "abstract": "Liquid democracy is a hybrid direct-representative decision making process that provides each voter with the option of either voting directly or to delegate their vote to another voter, i.e., to a representative of their choice. One of the proposed advantages of liquid democracy is that, in general, it is assumed that voters will delegate their vote to others that are better informed, which leads to more informed and better decisions. Considering an audience from various knowledge domains, we provide an accessible high-level analysis of a prominent critique of liquid democracy by Caragiannis and Micha. Caragiannis and Micha's critique contains three central topics: 1. Analysis using their $\\alpha$-delegation model, which does not assume delegation to the more informed; 2. Novel delegation network structures where it is advantageous to delegate to the less informed rather than the more informed; and 3. Due to NP hardness, the implied impracticability of a social network obtaining an optimal delegation structure. We show that in the real world, Caragiannis and Micha's critique of liquid democracy has little or no relevance. Respectively, our critique is based on: 1. The identification of incorrect $\\alpha$-delegation model assumptions; 2. A lack of novel delegation structures and their effect in a real-world implementation of liquid democracy, which would be guaranteed with constraints that sensibly distribute voting power; and 3. The irrelevance of an optimal delegation structure if the correct result is guaranteed regardless. We conclude that Caragiannis and Micha's critique has no significant negative relevance to the proposition of liquid democracy. ",

    "abstract": "Predicting the dynamic behaviors of particles in suspension subject to hydrodynamic interaction (HI) and external drive can be critical for many applications. By harvesting advanced deep learning techniques, the present work introduces a new framework, hydrodynamic interaction graph neural network (HIGNN), for inferring and predicting the particles' dynamics in Stokes suspensions. It overcomes the limitations of traditional approaches in computational efficiency, accuracy, and/or transferability. In particular, by uniting the data structure represented by a graph and the neural networks with learnable parameters, the HIGNN constructs surrogate modeling for the mobility tensor of particles which is the key to predicting the dynamics of particles subject to HI and external forces. To account for the many-body nature of HI, we generalize the state-of-the-art GNN by introducing higher-order connectivity into the graph and the corresponding convolutional operation. For training the HIGNN, we only need the data for a small number of particles in the domain of interest, and hence the training cost can be maintained low. Once constructed, the HIGNN permits fast predictions of the particles' velocities and is transferable to suspensions of different numbers/concentrations of particles in the same domain and to any external forcing. It has the ability to accurately capture both the long-range HI and short-range lubrication effects. We demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and transferability of the proposed HIGNN framework in a variety of systems. The requirement on computing resource is minimum: most simulations only require a desktop with one GPU; the simulations for a large suspension of 100,000 particles call for up to 6 GPUs. ",

    "abstract": "Graph-Convolution-based methods have been successfully applied to representation learning on homophily graphs where nodes with the same label or similar attributes tend to connect with one another. Due to the homophily assumption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) that these methods use, they are not suitable for heterophily graphs where nodes with different labels or dissimilar attributes tend to be adjacent. Several methods have attempted to address this heterophily problem, but they do not change the fundamental aggregation mechanism of GCNs because they rely on summation operators to aggregate information from neighboring nodes, which is implicitly subject to the homophily assumption. Here, we introduce a novel aggregation mechanism and develop a RAndom Walk Aggregation-based Graph Neural Network (called RAW-GNN) method. The proposed approach integrates the random walk strategy with graph neural networks. The new method utilizes breadth-first random walk search to capture homophily information and depth-first search to collect heterophily information. It replaces the conventional neighborhoods with path-based neighborhoods and introduces a new path-based aggregator based on Recurrent Neural Networks. These designs make RAW-GNN suitable for both homophily and heterophily graphs. Extensive experimental results showed that the new method achieved state-of-the-art performance on a variety of homophily and heterophily graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Blind Face Restoration (BFR) aims to recover high-quality face images from low-quality ones and usually resorts to facial priors for improving restoration performance. However, current methods still suffer from two major difficulties: 1) how to derive a powerful network architecture without extensive hand tuning; 2) how to capture complementary information from multiple facial priors in one network to improve restoration performance. To this end, we propose a Face Restoration Searching Network (FRSNet) to adaptively search the suitable feature extraction architecture within our specified search space, which can directly contribute to the restoration quality. On the basis of FRSNet, we further design our Multiple Facial Prior Searching Network (MFPSNet) with a multi-prior learning scheme. MFPSNet optimally extracts information from diverse facial priors and fuses the information into image features, ensuring that both external guidance and internal features are reserved. In this way, MFPSNet takes full advantage of semantic-level (parsing maps), geometric-level (facial heatmaps), reference-level (facial dictionaries) and pixel-level (degraded images) information and thus generates faithful and realistic images. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that MFPSNet performs favorably on both synthetic and real-world datasets against the state-of-the-art BFR methods.

Then, we convert vector shape prediction, regularization, and topology reconstruction into a unique primitive graph learning problem. Specifically, GraphMapper is a generic primitive graph learning network based on global shape context modelling through multi-head-attention. An embedding space sorting method is developed for accurate primitive relationship modelling. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphMapper on two challenging mapping tasks, building footprint regularization and road network topology reconstruction.

As a fine-grained recognition task, gait recognition is easily affected by many factors and usually requires a large amount of completely annotated data that is costly and insatiable. This paper proposes a large-scale self-supervised benchmark for gait recognition with contrastive learning, aiming to learn the general gait representation from massive unlabelled walking videos for practical applications via offering informative walking priors and diverse real-world variations. Specifically, we collect a large-scale unlabelled gait dataset GaitLU-1M consisting of 1.02M walking sequences and propose a conceptually simple yet empirically powerful baseline model GaitSSB. Experimentally, we evaluate the pre-trained model on four widely-used gait benchmarks, CASIA-B, OU-MVLP, GREW and Gait3D with or without transfer learning. The unsupervised results are comparable to or even better than the early model-based and GEI-based methods. After transfer learning, our method outperforms existing methods by a large margin in most cases. Theoretically, we discuss the critical issues for gait-specific contrastive framework and present some insights for further study. As far as we know, GaitLU-1M is the first large-scale unlabelled gait dataset, and GaitSSB is the first method that achieves remarkable unsupervised results on the aforementioned benchmarks.

As annotating large amounts of data is time-consuming and labor-intensive, data scarcity occurs frequently in real-world scenarios, which motivates multi-label few-shot aspect category detection. However, research on this problem is still in infancy and few methods are available. In this paper, we propose a novel label-enhanced prototypical network (LPN) for multi-label few-shot aspect category detection. The highlights of LPN can be summarized as follows. First, it leverages label description as auxiliary knowledge to learn more discriminative prototypes, which can retain aspect-relevant information while eliminating the harmful effect caused by irrelevant aspects. Second, it integrates with contrastive learning, which encourages that the sentences with the same aspect label are pulled together in embedding space while simultaneously pushing apart the sentences with different aspect labels. In addition, it introduces an adaptive multi-label inference module to predict the aspect count in the sentence, which is simple yet effective. Extensive experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that our proposed model LPN can consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance. ",

Given a GNN model, several interpretability approaches exist to explain GNN models with diverse (sometimes conflicting) evaluation methodologies. In this paper, we propose a benchmark for evaluating the explainability approaches for GNNs called Bagel. In Bagel, we firstly propose four diverse GNN explanation evaluation regimes -- 1) faithfulness, 2) sparsity, 3) correctness. and 4) plausibility. We reconcile multiple evaluation metrics in the existing literature and cover diverse notions for a holistic evaluation. Our graph datasets range from citation networks, document graphs, to graphs from molecules and proteins.

However, only a handful of these defenses held up their claims because correctly evaluating robustness is extremely challenging: Weak attacks often fail to find adversarial examples even if they unknowingly exist, thereby making a vulnerable network look robust. In this paper, we propose a test to identify weak attacks, and thus weak defense evaluations. Our test slightly modifies a neural network to guarantee the existence of an adversarial example for every sample. Consequentially, any correct attack must succeed in breaking this modified network. For eleven out of thirteen previously-published defenses, the original evaluation of the defense fails our test, while stronger attacks that break these defenses pass it. We hope that attack unit tests - such as ours - will be a major component in future robustness evaluations and increase confidence in an empirical field that is currently riddled with skepticism. ",

However, explanations give rise to potential side-channels that can be leveraged by an adversary for mounting attacks on the system. In particular, post-hoc explanation methods that highlight input dimensions according to their importance or relevance to the result also leak information that weakens security and privacy. In this work, we perform the first systematic characterization of the privacy and security risks arising from various popular explanation techniques. First, we propose novel explanation-guided black-box evasion attacks that lead to 10 times reduction in query count for the same success rate. We show that the adversarial advantage from explanations can be quantified as a reduction in the total variance of the estimated gradient. Second, we revisit the membership information leaked by common explanations. Contrary to observations in prior studies, via our modified attacks we show significant leakage of membership information (above 100% improvement over prior results), even in a much stricter black-box setting. Finally, we study explanation-guided model extraction attacks and demonstrate adversarial gains through a large reduction in query count. ",

Among the many proposed compression approaches, one of the most popular is \\emph{pruning}, whereby entire elements of the ANN (links, nodes, channels, \\ldots) and the corresponding weights are deleted. Since the nature of the problem is inherently combinatorial (what elements to prune and what not), we propose a new pruning method based on Operational Research tools. We start from a natural Mixed-Integer-Programming model for the problem, and we use the Perspective Reformulation technique to strengthen its continuous relaxation. Projecting away the indicator variables from this reformulation yields a new regularization term, which we call the Structured Perspective Regularization, that leads to structured pruning of the initial architecture. We test our method on some ResNet architectures applied to CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, obtaining competitive performances w.r.t.~the state of the art for structured pruning. ",

We propose FuSeBMC v4, a test generator that relies on smart seeds to improve the hybrid fuzzer to achieve high C programs coverage. First, FuSeBMC analyses and incrementally injects goal labels into the given C program to guide BMC and Evolutionary Fuzzing engines. Also, It ranks these goal labels according to the given strategy. After that, the engines are employed to produce smart seeds quickly to use later. Then, FuSeBMC coordinates between the engines and seed distribution by the Tracer. This Tracer generally manages the tool to record the goals covered and transfer the information between the engines by providing a shared memory to harness the power and take advantage of the power of each engine. So that the BMC engine helps give the seed that makes the fuzzing engine not struggle with complex mathematical guards. Furthermore, Tracer evaluates test cases dynamically to convert high-impact cases into seeds for subsequent test fuzzing.

Attack modeling formalisms based on DAG are prominently used to specify these scenarios. Our contribution is a new DAG-based formalism for MTDs and its translation into a Price Timed Markov Decision Process to find the best activation frequencies against the attacker's time/cost-optimal strategies. For the first time, MTD activation frequencies are analyzed in a state-of-the-art DAG-based representation.

In this work, we design a general solution operator for two different time-independent PDEs using graph neural networks (GNNs) and spectral graph convolutions. We train the networks on simulated data from a finite elements solver on a variety of shapes and inhomogeneities. In contrast to previous works, we focus on the ability of the trained operator to generalize to previously unseen scenarios. Specifically, we test generalization to meshes with different shapes and superposition of solutions for a different number of inhomogeneities. We find that training on a diverse dataset with lots of variation in the finite element meshes is a key ingredient for achieving good generalization results in all cases. With this, we believe that GNNs can be used to learn solution operators that generalize over a range of properties and produce solutions much faster than a generic solver. Our dataset, which we make publicly available, can be used and extended to verify the robustness of these models under varying conditions. ",

Bidirectional multi-scale feature fusion promotes local and global coherence and has become a de facto design principle for networks targeting spatially sensitive tasks e.g. HRNet and EfficientDet. When paired with high-resolution inputs, these networks achieve state-of-the-art results across various computer vision tasks, but training them requires substantial accelerator memory for saving large, multi-resolution activations. These memory requirements cap network size and limit progress. Using reversible recomputation, the RevSilo alleviates memory issues while still operating across resolution scales. Stacking RevSilos, we create RevBiFPN, a fully reversible bidirectional feature pyramid network. For classification, RevBiFPN is competitive with networks such as EfficientNet while using up to 19.8x lesser training memory. When fine-tuned on COCO, RevBiFPN provides up to a 2.5% boost in AP over HRNet using fewer MACs and a 2.4x reduction in training-time memory. ",

However its potential in motion forecasting for autonomous driving has rarely been explored. In this study, we report the first systematic exploration and assessment of incorporating self-supervision into motion forecasting. We first propose to investigate four novel self-supervised learning tasks for motion forecasting with theoretical rationale and quantitative and qualitative comparisons on the challenging large-scale Argoverse dataset. Secondly, we point out that our auxiliary SSL-based learning setup not only outperforms forecasting methods which use transformers, complicated fusion mechanisms and sophisticated online dense goal candidate optimization algorithms in terms of performance accuracy, but also has low inference time and architectural complexity.

    "abstract": "The recent development of novel aerial vehicles capable of physically interacting with the environment leads to new applications such as contact-based inspection. These tasks require the robotic system to exchange forces with partially-known environments, which may contain uncertainties including unknown spatially-varying friction properties and discontinuous variations of the surface geometry. Finding a control strategy that is robust against these environmental uncertainties remains an open challenge. This paper presents a learning-based adaptive control strategy for aerial sliding tasks. In particular, the gains of a standard impedance controller are adjusted in real-time by a policy based on the current control signals, proprioceptive measurements, and tactile sensing. This policy is trained in simulation with simplified actuator dynamics in a student-teacher learning setup. The real-world performance of the proposed approach is verified using a tilt-arm omnidirectional flying vehicle. The proposed controller structure combines data-driven and model-based control methods, enabling our approach to successfully transfer directly and without adaptation from simulation to the real platform. Compared to fine-tuned state of the art interaction control methods we achieve reduced tracking error and improved disturbance rejection. ",

We propose that investigation of the variables that strongly influence solution quality and their relationship would be a step toward providing an explanation of the near-optimal solution presented by a metaheuristic. Through the use of four benchmark problems we use the population data generated by a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to train a surrogate model, and investigate the learning of the search space by the surrogate model. We compare what the surrogate has learned after being trained on population data generated after the first generation and contrast this with a surrogate model trained on the population data from all generations. We show that the surrogate model picks out key characteristics of the problem as it is trained on population data from each generation. Through mining the surrogate model we can build a picture of the learning process of a GA, and thus an explanation of the solution presented by the GA. The aim being to build trust and confidence in the end-user about the solution presented by the GA, and encourage adoption of the model. ",

We examine the temporal distribution of when GPIs were created and illustrate the dramatic increase in privacy legislation over the past 50 years, although a finer-grained examination reveals that the rate of increase varies depending on the personal data types that GPIs address. Our exploration also demonstrates that most privacy laws respectively address relatively few personal data types, showing that comprehensive privacy legislation remains rare. Additionally, topic modeling results show the prevalence of common themes in GPIs, such as finance, healthcare, and telecommunications.

This gives the flexibility to predict in longer horizons in real-world settings. We suggest this new problem and present a simple yet effective model for pedestrians' 3D bounding box prediction.

Finally, we propose a preference-based ensemble strategy to combine the output predictions from different models in order to achieve better performance on classification and detection of defects. As CDSEM images inherently contain a significant level of noise, detailed feature information is often shadowed by noise. For certain resist profiles, the challenge is also to differentiate between a microbridge, footing, break, and zones of probable breaks. Therefore, we have applied an unsupervised machine learning model to denoise the SEM images to remove the False-Positive defects and optimize the effect of stochastic noise on structured pixels for better metrology and enhanced defect inspection. We repeated the defect inspection step with the same trained model and performed a comparative analysis for \"robustness\" and \"accuracy\" metric with conventional approach for both noisy/denoised image pair. The proposed ensemble method demonstrates improvement of the average precision metric (mAP) of the most difficult defect classes. In this work we have developed a novel robust supervised deep learning training scheme to accurately classify as well as localize different defect types in SEM images with high degree of accuracy.

    "abstract": "Comprehensive semantic segmentation on renal pathological images is challenging due to the heterogeneous scales of the objects. For example, on a whole slide image (WSI), the cross-sectional areas of glomeruli can be 64 times larger than that of the peritubular capillaries, making it impractical to segment both objects on the same patch, at the same scale. To handle this scaling issue, prior studies have typically trained multiple segmentation networks in order to match the optimal pixel resolution of heterogeneous tissue types. This multi-network solution is resource-intensive and fails to model the spatial relationship between tissue types. In this paper, we propose the Omni-Seg+ network, a scale-aware dynamic neural network that achieves multi-object (six tissue types) and multi-scale (5X to 40X scale) pathological image segmentation via a single neural network. The contribution of this paper is three-fold: (1) a novel scale-aware controller is proposed to generalize the dynamic neural network from single-scale to multi-scale; (2) semi-supervised consistency regularization of pseudo-labels is introduced to model the inter-scale correlation of unannotated tissue types into a single end-to-end learning paradigm; and (3) superior scale-aware generalization is evidenced by directly applying a model trained on human kidney images to mouse kidney images, without retraining. By learning from ~150,000 human pathological image patches from six tissue types at three different resolutions, our approach achieved superior segmentation performance according to human visual assessment and evaluation of image-omics (i.e., spatial transcriptomics).

    "abstract": "Typically, singing voice conversion (SVC) depends on an embedding vector, extracted from either a speaker lookup table (LUT) or a speaker recognition network (SRN), to model speaker identity. However, singing contains more expressive speaker characteristics than conversational speech. It is suspected that a single embedding vector may only capture averaged and coarse-grained speaker characteristics, which is insufficient for the SVC task. To this end, this work proposes a novel hierarchical speaker representation framework for SVC, which can capture fine-grained speaker characteristics at different granularity. It consists of an up-sampling stream and three down-sampling streams. The up-sampling stream transforms the linguistic features into audio samples, while one down-sampling stream of the three operates in the reverse direction. It is expected that the temporal statistics of each down-sampling block can represent speaker characteristics at different granularity, which will be engaged in the up-sampling blocks to enhance the speaker modeling. Experiment results verify that the proposed method outperforms both the LUT and SRN based SVC systems. Moreover, the proposed system supports the one-shot SVC with only a few seconds of reference audio. ",

In this paper, we propose two back-end systems: multi-layer perceptron score fusion model (MSFM) and integrated embedding projector (IEP). The MSFM, score fusion back-end system, derived SASV score utilizing ASV and CM scores and embeddings. On the other hand,IEP combines ASV and CM embeddings into SASV embedding and calculates final SASV score based on the cosine similarity. We effectively integrated ASV and CM systems through proposed MSFM and IEP and achieved the SASV equal error rates 0.56%, 1.32% on the official evaluation trials of the SASV 2022 challenge. ",

For instance, recent concept-based explanation techniques analyze a machine learning model in terms of interpretable latent components. Such components have to be discovered in the model's embedding space, e.g., through independent component analysis (ICA) or modern disentanglement learning techniques. While these unsupervised approaches offer a sound formal framework, they either require access to a data generating function or impose rigid assumptions on the data distribution, such as independence of components, that are often violated in practice. In this work, we link conceptual explainability for vision models with disentanglement learning and ICA. This enables us to provide first theoretical results on how components can be identified without requiring any distributional assumptions. From these insights, we derive the disjoint attributions (DA) concept discovery method that is applicable to a broader class of problems than current approaches but yet possesses a formal identifiability guarantee. In an extensive comparison against component analysis and over 300 state-of-the-art disentanglement models, DA stably maintains superior performance, even under varying distributions and correlation strengths.

    "abstract": "Recently, introspective models like IntroVAE and S-IntroVAE have excelled in image generation and reconstruction tasks. The principal characteristic of introspective models is the adversarial learning of VAE, where the encoder attempts to distinguish between the real and the fake (i.e., synthesized) images. However, due to the unavailability of an effective metric to evaluate the difference between the real and the fake images, the posterior collapse and the vanishing gradient problem still exist, reducing the fidelity of the synthesized images. In this paper, we propose a new variation of IntroVAE called Adversarial Similarity Distance Introspective Variational Autoencoder (AS-IntroVAE). We theoretically analyze the vanishing gradient problem and construct a new Adversarial Similarity Distance (AS-Distance) using the 2-Wasserstein distance and the kernel trick. With weight annealing on AS-Distance and KL-Divergence, the AS-IntroVAE are able to generate stable and high-quality images. The posterior collapse problem is addressed by making per-batch attempts to transform the image so that it better fits the prior distribution in the latent space. Compared with the per-image approach, this strategy fosters more diverse distributions in the latent space, allowing our model to produce images of great diversity. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AS-IntroVAE on image generation and reconstruction tasks. ",

An important class of computational problems include so-called integro-differential equations which include both integrals and derivatives of a function. In another example, stochastic differential equations can be written in terms of a partial differential equation of a probability density function of the stochastic variable. To learn characteristics of the stochastic variable based on the density function, specific integral transforms, namely moments, of the density function need to be calculated. Recently, the machine learning paradigm of Physics-Informed Neural Networks emerged with increasing popularity as a method to solve differential equations by leveraging automatic differentiation. In this work, we propose to augment the paradigm of Physics-Informed Neural Networks with automatic integration in order to compute complex integral transforms on trained solutions, and to solve integro-differential equations where integrals are computed on-the-fly during training.
