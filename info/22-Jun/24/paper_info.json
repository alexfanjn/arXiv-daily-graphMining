    "title": "Latent Policies for Adversarial Imitation Learning",
    "abstract": "This paper considers learning robot locomotion and manipulation tasks from expert demonstrations. Generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) trains a discriminator that distinguishes expert from agent transitions, and in turn use a reward defined by the discriminator output to optimize a policy generator for the agent. This generative adversarial training approach is very powerful but depends on a delicate balance between the discriminator and the generator training. In high-dimensional problems, the discriminator training may easily overfit or exploit associations with task-irrelevant features for transition classification. A key insight of this work is that performing imitation learning in a suitable latent task space makes the training process stable, even in challenging high-dimensional problems. We use an action encoder-decoder model to obtain a low-dimensional latent action space and train a LAtent Policy using Adversarial imitation Learning (LAPAL). The encoder-decoder model can be trained offline from state-action pairs to obtain a task-agnostic latent action representation or online, simultaneously with the discriminator and generator training, to obtain a task-aware latent action representation. We demonstrate that LAPAL training is stable, with near-monotonic performance improvement, and achieves expert performance in most locomotion and manipulation tasks, while a GAIL baseline converges slower and does not achieve expert performance in high-dimensional environments.

    "title": "Community Recovery in the Geometric Block Model",
    "abstract": "To capture inherent geometric features of many community detection problems, we propose to use a new random graph model of communities that we call a \\emph{Geometric Block Model}. The geometric block model builds on the \\emph{random geometric graphs} (Gilbert, 1961), one of the basic models of random graphs for spatial networks, in the same way that the well-studied stochastic block model builds on the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{en}yi random graphs. It is also a natural extension of random community models inspired by the recent theoretical and practical advancements in community detection. To analyze the geometric block model, we first provide new connectivity results for \\emph{random annulus graphs} which are generalizations of random geometric graphs. The connectivity properties of geometric graphs have been studied since their introduction, and analyzing them has been difficult due to correlated edge formation. We then use the connectivity results of random annulus graphs to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for efficient recovery of communities for the geometric block model. We show that a simple triangle-counting algorithm to detect communities in the geometric block model is near-optimal. For this we consider two regimes of graph density. In the regime where the average degree of the graph grows logarithmically with number of vertices, we show that our algorithm performs extremely well, both theoretically and practically. In contrast, the triangle-counting algorithm is far from being optimum for the stochastic block model in the logarithmic degree regime. We also look at the regime where the average degree of the graph grows linearly with the number of vertices $n$, and hence to store the graph one needs $\\Theta(n^2)$ memory. We show that our algorithm needs to store only $O(n \\log n)$ edges in this regime to recover the latent communities. ",

    "abstract": "Radio access network (RAN) slicing allows the division of the network into several logical networks tailored to different and varying service requirements in a sustainable way. It is thereby considered a key enabler of 5G and next generation networks. However, determining optimal strategies for RAN slicing remains a challenging issue. Using machine learning algorithms to address such a difficult problem is promising. However, due to the large differences imposed by RAN deployments and the disparity of their required services it is difficult to utilize the same slicing model across all the covered areas. Moreover, the data collected by each mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) in different areas is mostly limited and rarely shared among operators. Federated learning presents new opportunities for MVNOs to benefit from distributed training. In this paper, we propose a federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) approach to train bandwidth allocation models among MVNOs based on their interactions with their users. We evaluate the proposed approach through extensive simulations to show the importance of such collaboration in building efficient network slicing models. ",

The goal is to position as many facilities as possible subject to the condition that every two facilities have distance at least $\\delta$ from each other. Our main technical contribution is an efficient procedure to `round-up' distance $\\delta$. It transforms a $\\delta$-dispersed set $S$ into a $\\delta^\\star$-dispersed set $S^\\star$ of same size where distance $\\delta^\\star$ is a slightly larger rational $\\tfrac{a}{b}$ with a numerator $a$ upper bounded by the longest (not-induced) path in the input graph. Based on this rounding procedure and connections to the distance-$d$ independent set problem we derive a number of algorithmic results. When parameterized by treewidth, the problem is in XP. When parameterized by treedepth the problem is FPT and has a matching lower bound on its time complexity under ETH. Moreover, we can also settle the parameterized complexity with the solution size as parameter using our rounding technique: $\\delta$-\\dispersion is FPT for every $\\delta \\leq 2$ and W[1]-hard for every $\\delta > 2$. Further, we show that $\\delta$-dispersion is NP-complete for every fixed irrational distance $\\delta$, which was left open in a previous work. ",

In the current literature, such task is universally solved via a message passing neural network based mean field variational Bayesian methodology. The classical loose evidence lower bound is generally chosen as the variational inference objective, which could induce oversimplified variational approximation and thus underestimate the underlying complex posterior. In this paper, we propose a novel doubly reparameterized importance weighted structure learning method, which employs a tighter importance weighted lower bound as the variational inference objective. It is computed from multiple samples drawn from a reparameterizable Gumbel-Softmax sampler and the resulting constrained variational inference task is solved by a generic entropic mirror descent algorithm. The resulting doubly reparameterized gradient estimator reduces the variance of the corresponding derivatives with a beneficial impact on learning. The proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various popular scene graph generation benchmarks. ",

Standardization for recently started IEEE 802.11be (Wi-Fi 7) Working Groups has focused on significant medium access control layer changes that emphasize the role of the access point (AP) in radio resource management (RRM) for coordinating channel access due to the high collision probability with the distributed coordination function (DCF), especially in dense overlapping Wi-Fi networks. This paper proposes a novel multi-AP coordination system architecture aided by a centralized AP controller (APC). Meanwhile, a deep reinforcement learning channel access (DLCA) protocol is developed to replace the binary exponential backoff mechanism in DCF to enhance the network throughput by enabling the coordination of APs. First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning further enhances the network throughput. Subsequently, we also put forward a new greedy algorithm to maintain proportional fairness (PF) among multiple APs. Via the simulation, the performance of DLCA protocol in dense overlapping Wi-Fi networks is verified to have strong stability and outperform baselines such as Shared Transmission Opportunity (SH-TXOP) and Request-to-Send/Clear-to-Send (RTS/CTS) in terms of the network throughput by 10% and 3% as well as the network utility considering proportional fairness by 28.3% and 13.8%, respectively.

To improve the reliability of the URLLC transmissions, we propose a coding scheme with finite blocklength codewords that exploits dirty-paper coding (DPC) to precancel the interference from eMBB transmissions. Rigorous bounds are derived for the error probabilities of eMBB and URLLC transmissions achieved by our scheme. Numerical results illustrate that they are lower than for standard time-sharing. ",

Our main theoretical contribution is providing a mechanism for achieving BDP when data is drawn from a binary Markov chain. We improve on the state-of-the-art BDP mechanism and show that our mechanism provides the optimal noise-privacy tradeoffs for any local mechanism up to negligible factors. We also briefly discuss a non-local mechanism which adds correlated noise. Lastly, we perform experiments on synthetic data that detail when DP is insufficient, and experiments on real data to show that our privacy guarantees are robust to underlying distributions that are not simple Markov chains.

Conventional adjacency-based data structures used for storing networks such as adjacency lists were designed without incorporating time and can thus quickly retrieve all edges between two sets of nodes (a node-based slice) but cannot quickly retrieve all edges that occur within a given time interval (a time-based slice). We propose a hybrid data structure for storing temporal networks that stores edges in both an adjacency dictionary, enabling rapid node-based slices, and an interval tree, enabling rapid time-based slices. Our hybrid structure also enables compound slices, where one needs to slice both over nodes and time, either by slicing first over nodes or slicing first over time. We further propose an approach for predictive compound slicing, which attempts to predict whether a node-based or time-based compound slice is more efficient. We evaluate our hybrid data structure on many real temporal network data sets and find that they achieve much faster slice times than existing data structures with only a modest increase in creation time and memory usage.

Such redundancies make the search process inefficient. We propose a graph-based search policy that eliminates the redundant explorations of any intermediate molecules. As searching over a graph is more complicated than over a tree, we further adopt a graph neural network to guide the search over graphs. Meanwhile, our method can search a batch of targets together in the graph and remove the inter-target duplication in the tree-based search methods. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

The interplay between a server's defense and an adversary's attack inevitably leads to an arms race dilemma, as commonly seen in Adversarial Machine Learning. To study the fundamental tradeoffs between model utility from a benign user's view and privacy from an adversary's view, we develop new metrics to quantify such tradeoffs, analyze their theoretical properties, and develop an optimization problem to understand the optimal adversarial attack and defense strategies. The developed concepts and theory match the empirical findings on the `equilibrium' between privacy and utility.

In this paper, we define an explanatory causal effect based on a hypothetical ideal experiment. The definition brings several benefits to model agnostic explanations. First, explanations are transparent and have causal meanings. Second, the explanatory causal effect estimation can be data driven. Third, the causal effects provide both a local explanation for a specific prediction and a global explanation showing the overall importance of a feature in a predictive model. We further propose a method using individual and combined variables based on explanatory causal effects for explanations. We show the definition and the method work with experiments on some real-world data sets. ",

    "title": "A Neuromorphic Vision-Based Measurement for Robust Relative Localization  in Future Space Exploration Missions",
    "abstract": "Space exploration has witnessed revolutionary changes upon landing of the Perseverance Rover on the Martian surface and demonstrating the first flight beyond Earth by the Mars helicopter, Ingenuity. During their mission on Mars, Perseverance Rover and Ingenuity collaboratively explore the Martian surface, where Ingenuity scouts terrain information for rover's safe traversability. Hence, determining the relative poses between both the platforms is of paramount importance for the success of this mission. Driven by this necessity, this work proposes a robust relative localization system based on a fusion of neuromorphic vision-based measurements (NVBMs) and inertial measurements. The emergence of neuromorphic vision triggered a paradigm shift in the computer vision community, due to its unique working principle delineated with asynchronous events triggered by variations of light intensities occurring in the scene. This implies that observations cannot be acquired in static scenes due to illumination invariance. To circumvent this limitation, high frequency active landmarks are inserted in the scene to guarantee consistent event firing. These landmarks are adopted as salient features to facilitate relative localization. A novel event-based landmark identification algorithm using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) is developed for matching the landmarks correspondences formulating our NVBMs. The NVBMs are fused with inertial measurements in proposed state estimators, landmark tracking Kalman filter (LTKF) and translation decoupled Kalman filter (TDKF) for landmark tracking and relative localization, respectively. The proposed system was tested in a variety of experiments and has outperformed state-of-the-art approaches in accuracy and range. ",

Rate adaptation (RA) becomes indispensable to enhance UAV communication robustness against UAV mobility-induced channel variances. However, existing MU-MIMO RA algorithms are mainly designed for ground communications with relatively stable channel coherence time, which incurs channel measurement staleness and sub-optimal rate selections when coping with highly dynamic air-to-ground links. In this paper, we propose SensRate, a new uplink MU-MIMO RA algorithm dedicated for low-altitude UAVs, which exploits inherent onboard sensors used for flight control with no extra cost. We propose a novel channel prediction algorithm that utilizes sensor-estimated flight states to assist channel direction prediction for each client and estimate inter-user interference for optimal rates. We provide an implementation of our design using a commercial UAV and show that it achieves an average throughput gain of 1.24\\times and 1.28\\times compared with the bestknown RA algorithm for 2- and 3-antenna APs, respectively ",

In view of this, we propose a method to mine error templates for GEC automatically. An error template is a regular expression aiming at identifying text errors. We use the web crawler to acquire such error templates from the Internet. For each template, we further select the corresponding corrective action by using the language model perplexity as a criterion. We have accumulated 1,119 error templates for Chinese GEC based on this method. Experimental results on the newly proposed CTC-2021 Chinese GEC benchmark show that combing our error templates can effectively improve the performance of a strong GEC system, especially on two error types with very little training data.

    "abstract": "The structure of the graph defined by the interactions in a Boolean network can determine properties of the asymptotic dynamics. For instance, considering the asynchronous dynamics, the absence of positive cycles guarantees the existence of a unique attractor, and the absence of negative cycles ensures that all attractors are fixed points. In presence of multiple attractors, one might be interested in properties that ensure that attractors are sufficiently \"isolated\", that is, they can be found in separate subspaces or even trap spaces, subspaces that are closed with respect to the dynamics. Here we introduce notions of separability for attractors and identify corresponding necessary conditions on the interaction graph. In particular, we show that if the interaction graph has at most one positive cycle, or at most one negative cycle, or if no positive cycle intersects a negative cycle, then the attractors can be separated by subspaces. If the interaction graph has no path from a negative to a positive cycle, then the attractors can be separated by trap spaces. Furthermore, we study networks with interaction graphs admitting two vertices that intersect all cycles, and show that if their attractors cannot be separated by subspaces, then their interaction graph must contain a copy of the complete signed digraph on two vertices, deprived of a negative loop. We thus establish a connection between a dynamical property and a complex network motif. The topic is far from exhausted and we conclude by stating some open questions. ",

However, underestimating the head predicates in the whole training process, they wreck the features of head predicates that provide general features for tail ones. Besides, assigning excessive attention to the tail predicates leads to semantic deviation. Based on this, we propose a novel SGG framework, learning to generate scene graphs from Head to Tail (SGG-HT), containing Curriculum Re-weight Mechanism (CRM) and Semantic Context Module (SCM). CRM learns head/easy samples firstly for robust features of head predicates and then gradually focuses on tail/hard ones. SCM is proposed to relieve semantic deviation by ensuring the semantic consistency between the generated scene graph and the ground truth in global and local representations. Experiments show that SGG-HT significantly alleviates the biased problem and chieves state-of-the-art performances on Visual Genome. ",

At the same time, efficiently parallelizing HAC is difficult due to the seemingly sequential nature of the algorithm. In this paper, we address this issue and present ParHAC, the first efficient parallel HAC algorithm with sublinear depth for the widely-used average-linkage function. In particular, we provide a $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for this problem on $m$ edge graphs using $\\tilde{O}(m)$ work and poly-logarithmic depth. Moreover, we show that obtaining similar bounds for exact average-linkage HAC is not possible under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions. We complement our theoretical results with a comprehensive study of the ParHAC algorithm in terms of its scalability, performance, and quality, and compare with several state-of-the-art sequential and parallel baselines. On a broad set of large publicly-available real-world datasets, we find that ParHAC obtains a 50.1x speedup on average over the best sequential baseline, while achieving quality similar to the exact HAC algorithm. We also show that ParHAC can cluster one of the largest publicly available graph datasets with 124 billion edges in a little over three hours using a commodity multicore machine. ",

In this paper, we propose Warped Convolution Networks (WCN) to effectively estimate the homography transformation by SL(3) group and sl(3) algebra with group convolution. To this end, six commutative subgroups within SL(3) group are composed to form a homography transformation. For each subgroup, a warping function is proposed to bridge the Lie algebra structure to its corresponding parameters in tomography. By taking advantage of the warped convolution, homography estimation is formulated into several simple pseudo-translation regressions. By walking along the Lie topology, our proposed WCN is able to learn the features that are invariant to homography transformation. It can be easily plugged into other popular CNN-based methods. Extensive experiments on POT benchmark and MNIST-Proj dataset show that our proposed method is effective for both homography estimation and classification. ",

    "abstract": "Inferring tie strengths in social networks is an essential task in social network analysis. Common approaches classify the ties as weak and strong ties based on the strong triadic closure (STC). The STC states that if for three nodes, $A$, $B$, and $C$, there are strong ties between $A$ and $B$, as well as $A$ and $C$, there has to be a (weak or strong) tie between $B$ and $C$. So far, most works discuss the STC in static networks. However, modern large-scale social networks are usually highly dynamic, providing user contacts and communications as streams of edge updates. Temporal networks capture these dynamics. To apply the STC to temporal networks, we first generalize the STC and introduce a weighted version such that empirical a priori knowledge given in the form of edge weights is respected by the STC. The weighted STC is hard to compute, and our main contribution is an efficient 2-approximative streaming algorithm for the weighted STC in temporal networks. As a technical contribution, we introduce a fully dynamic 2-approximation for the minimum weight vertex cover problem, which is a crucial component of our streaming algorithm. Our evaluation shows that the weighted STC leads to solutions that capture the a priori knowledge given by the edge weights better than the non-weighted STC. Moreover, we show that our streaming algorithm efficiently approximates the weighted STC in large-scale social networks. ",

    "abstract": "Short-term load forecasting (STLF) plays a significant role in the operation of electricity trading markets. Considering the growing concern of data privacy, federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted to train STLF models for utility companies (UCs) in recent research. Inspiringly, in wholesale markets, as it is not realistic for power plants (PPs) to access UCs' data directly, FL is definitely a feasible solution of obtaining an accurate STLF model for PPs. However, due to FL's distributed nature and intense competition among UCs, defects increasingly occur and lead to poor performance of the STLF model, indicating that simply adopting FL is not enough. In this paper, we propose a DRL-assisted FL approach, DEfect-AwaRe federated soft actor-critic (DearFSAC), to robustly train an accurate STLF model for PPs to forecast precise short-term utility electricity demand. Firstly. we design a STLF model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) using just historical load data and time data. Furthermore, considering the uncertainty of defects occurrence, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is adopted to assist FL by alleviating model degradation caused by defects. In addition, for faster convergence of FL training, an auto-encoder is designed for both dimension reduction and quality evaluation of uploaded models. In the simulations, we validate our approach on real data of Helsinki's UCs in 2019. The results show that DearFSAC outperforms all the other approaches no matter if defects occur or not. ",

    "abstract": "Deep convolutional autoencoders provide an effective tool for learning non-linear dimensionality reduction in an unsupervised way. Recently, they have been used for the task of anomaly detection in the visual domain. By optimising for the reconstruction error using anomaly-free examples, the common belief is that a trained network will have difficulties to reconstruct anomalous parts during the test phase. This is usually done by controlling the capacity of the network by either reducing the size of the bottleneck layer or enforcing sparsity constraints on its activations. However, neither of these techniques does explicitly penalise reconstruction of anomalous signals often resulting in a poor detection. We tackle this problem by adapting a self-supervised learning regime which allows to use discriminative information during training while regularising the model to focus on the data manifold by means of a modified reconstruction error resulting in an accurate detection. Unlike related approaches, the inference of the proposed method during training and prediction is very efficient processing the whole input image in one single step. Our experiments on the MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset demonstrate high recognition and localisation performance of the proposed method. On the texture-subset, in particular, our approach consistently outperforms a bunch of recent anomaly detection methods by a big margin. ",

Firstly, we propose algorithms for adversarial perturbation of both highly relevant and non-relevant documents using gradient-based optimization methods. The aim of our algorithms is to add/replace a small number of tokens to a highly relevant or non-relevant document to cause a large rank demotion or promotion. Our experiments show that a small number of tokens can already result in a large change in the rank of a document. Moreover, we find that BERT-rankers heavily rely on the document start/head for relevance prediction, making the initial part of the document more susceptible to adversarial attacks. More interestingly, we find a small set of recurring adversarial words that when added to documents result in successful rank demotion/promotion of any relevant/non-relevant document respectively. Finally, our adversarial tokens also show particular topic preferences within and across datasets, exposing potential biases from BERT pre-training or downstream datasets. ",

Despite the recent advances in 3D virtual try-on solutions, such approaches still remain limited to a very narrow - if not only a handful - selection of articles, and often for only one size of those fashion items. Other state-of-the-art approaches that aim to support customers find what fits them online mostly require a high level of customer engagement and privacy-sensitive data (such as height, weight, age, gender, belly shape, etc.), or alternatively need images of customers' bodies in tight clothing. They also often lack the ability to produce fit and shape aware visual guidance at scale, coming up short by simply advising which size to order that would best match a customer's physical body attributes, without providing any information on how the garment may fit and look. Contributing towards taking a leap forward and surpassing the limitations of current approaches, we present FitGAN, a generative adversarial model that explicitly accounts for garments' entangled size and fit characteristics of online fashion at scale. Conditioned on the fit and shape of the articles, our model learns disentangled item representations and generates realistic images reflecting the true fit and shape properties of fashion articles. Through experiments on real world data at scale, we demonstrate how our approach is capable of synthesizing visually realistic and diverse fits of fashion items and explore its ability to control fit and shape of images for thousands of online garments.

Recently, matrix completion methods (MCMs), transformers, and graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown high accuracy in predicting ACs of binary mixtures, superior to well-established models, e.g., COSMO-RS and UNIFAC. GNNs are particularly promising here as they learn a molecular graph-to-property relationship without pretraining, typically required for transformers, and are, unlike MCMs, applicable to molecules not included in training. For ILs, however, GNN applications are currently missing. Herein, we present a GNN to predict temperature-dependent infinite dilution ACs of solutes in ILs. We train the GNN on a database including more than 40,000 AC values and compare it to a state-of-the-art MCM. The GNN and MCM achieve similar high prediction performance, with the GNN additionally enabling high-quality predictions for ACs of solutions that contain ILs and solutes not considered during training.

    "abstract": "Copy detection patterns (CDP) are an attractive technology that allows manufacturers to defend their products against counterfeiting. The main assumption behind the protection mechanism of CDP is that these codes printed with the smallest symbol size (1x1) on an industrial printer cannot be copied or cloned with sufficient accuracy due to data processing inequality. However, previous works have shown that Machine Learning (ML) based attacks can produce high-quality fakes, resulting in decreased accuracy of authentication based on traditional feature-based authentication systems. While Deep Learning (DL) can be used as a part of the authentication system, to the best of our knowledge, none of the previous works has studied the performance of a DL-based authentication system against ML-based attacks on CDP with 1x1 symbol size. In this work, we study such a performance assuming a supervised learning (SL) setting. ",

However, the choice of words and vocal cues in conversations presents an underexplored rich source of natural language data for personal safety and crime prevention. When accompanied by audio analysis, it makes it possible to understand the context of a conversation, including the level of tension or rift between people. Building on existing work, we introduce a new information fusion approach that extracts and fuses multi-level features including verbal, vocal, and text as heterogeneous sources of information to detect the extent of violent behaviours in conversations. Our multilevel multimodel fusion framework integrates four types of information from raw audio signals including embeddings generated from both BERT and Bi-long short-term memory (LSTM) models along with the output of 2D CNN applied to Mel-frequency Cepstrum (MFCC) as well as the output of audio Time-Domain dense layer. The embeddings are then passed to three-layer FC networks, which serve as a concatenated step. Our experimental setup revealed that the combination of the multi-level features from different modalities achieves better performance than using a single one with F1 Score=0.85. We expect that the findings derived from our method provides new approaches for violence detection in conversations. ",

Specifically, agents are tasked with selecting actions from a common ground set according to individualized objective functions, and we aim to protect the system against attacks. In our problem formulation, attackers attempt to disrupt the system by removing an agent's contribution after knowing the system solution and thus can attack perfectly. To protect the multi-agent system against such attacks, we aim to maximize the minimum performance of all agents' individual objective functions under attacks. Thus, we propose a fast algorithm with tunable parameters for balancing complexity and performance, yielding substantially improved time complexity and performance compared to recent methods. Finally, we provide Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm. ",

To improve the classification accuracy, most computer-aided diagnosis algorithms recognize colorectal polyps by adopting Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI). However, the NBI usually suffers from missing utilization in real clinic scenarios since the acquisition of this specific image requires manual switching of the light mode when polyps have been detected by using White-Light (WL) images. To avoid the above situation, we propose a novel method to directly achieve accurate white-light colonoscopy image classification by conducting structured cross-modal representation consistency. In practice, a pair of multi-modal images, i.e. NBI and WL, are fed into a shared Transformer to extract hierarchical feature representations. Then a novel designed Spatial Attention Module (SAM) is adopted to calculate the similarities between the class token and patch tokens %from multi-levels for a specific modality image. By aligning the class tokens and spatial attention maps of paired NBI and WL images at different levels, the Transformer achieves the ability to keep both global and local representation consistency for the above two modalities. Extensive experimental results illustrate the proposed method outperforms the recent studies with a margin, realizing multi-modal prediction with a single Transformer while greatly improving the classification accuracy when only with WL images.

This focus on model-level outcomes and errors has masked important aspects of ML that are rooted in its inherent non-determinism. We show that the effects of non-determinism, and consequently its implications for the law, instead become clearer from the perspective of reasoning about ML outputs as probability distributions over possible outcomes. This distributional viewpoint accounts for non-determinism by emphasizing the possible outcomes of ML. Importantly, this type of reasoning is not exclusive with current legal reasoning; it complements (and in fact can strengthen) analyses concerning individual, concrete outcomes for specific automated decisions. By clarifying the important role of non-determinism, we demonstrate that ML code falls outside of the cyberlaw frame of treating \"code as law,\" as this frame assumes that code is deterministic. We conclude with a brief discussion of what work ML can do to constrain the potentially harm-inducing effects of non-determinism, and we clarify where the law must do work to bridge the gap between its current individual-outcome focus and the distributional approach that we recommend.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have a high capacity to completely memorize noisy labels given sufficient training time, and its memorization, unfortunately, leads to performance degradation. Recently, virtual adversarial training (VAT) attracts attention as it could further improve the generalization of DNNs in semi-supervised learning. The driving force behind VAT is to prevent the models from overfitting data points by enforcing consistency between the inputs and the perturbed inputs. This strategy could be helpful in learning from noisy labels if it prevents neural models from learning noisy samples while encouraging the models to generalize clean samples. In this paper, we propose context-based virtual adversarial training (ConVAT) to prevent a text classifier from overfitting to noisy labels. Unlike the previous works, the proposed method performs the adversarial training at the context level rather than the inputs. It makes the classifier not only learn its label but also its contextual neighbors, which alleviates the learning from noisy labels by preserving contextual semantics on each data point. We conduct extensive experiments on four text classification datasets with two types of label noises. Comprehensive experimental results clearly show that the proposed method works quite well even with extremely noisy settings. ",

First, for memory and training efficiency, we use two types of window attention: spatial and spatiotemporal. Second, during training, we mask a variable percentage of tokens instead of a fixed mask ratio. For inference, MaskViT generates all tokens via iterative refinement where we incrementally decrease the masking ratio following a mask scheduling function. On several datasets we demonstrate that MaskViT outperforms prior works in video prediction, is parameter efficient, and can generate high-resolution videos (256x256). Further, we demonstrate the benefits of inference speedup (up to 512x) due to iterative decoding by using MaskViT for planning on a real robot. Our work suggests that we can endow embodied agents with powerful predictive models by leveraging the general framework of masked visual modeling with minimal domain knowledge. ",

At the same time, it is known from the neuroscience literature that human visual system (HVS) is tailored to process asynchronous brightness changes rather than synchronous RGB images, in order to build and continuously update mental 3D representations of the surroundings for navigation and survival. Visual sensors that were inspired by HVS principles are event cameras. Thus, events are sparse and asynchronous per-pixel brightness (or colour channel) change signals. In contrast to existing works on neural 3D scene representation learning, this paper approaches the problem from a new perspective. We demonstrate that it is possible to learn NeRF suitable for novel-view synthesis in the RGB space from asynchronous event streams. Our models achieve high visual accuracy of the rendered novel views of challenging scenes in the RGB space, even though they are trained with substantially fewer data (i.e., event streams from a single event camera moving around the object) and more efficiently (due to the inherent sparsity of event streams) than the existing NeRF models trained with RGB images.

Current generative models represent this manifold by mapping an $m$-dimensional latent variable through a neural network $f_\\theta: \\mathbb{R}^m \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$. Such procedures, which we call pushforward models, incur a straightforward limitation: manifolds cannot in general be represented with a single parameterization, meaning that attempts to do so will incur either computational instability or the inability to learn probability densities within the manifold. To remedy this problem, we propose to model $\\mathcal{M}$ as a neural implicit manifold: the set of zeros of a neural network. To learn the data distribution within $\\mathcal{M}$, we introduce constrained energy-based models, which use a constrained variant of Langevin dynamics to train and sample within the learned manifold. The resulting model can be manipulated with an arithmetic of manifolds which allows practitioners to take unions and intersections of model manifolds. In experiments on synthetic and natural data, we show that constrained EBMs can learn manifold-supported distributions with complex topologies more accurately than pushforward models. ",

    "title": "Bi-stochastically normalized graph Laplacian: convergence to manifold  Laplacian and robustness to outlier noise",
    "abstract": "Bi-stochastic normalization of kernelized graph affinity matrix provides an alternative normalization scheme for graph Laplacian methods in graph-based data analysis and can be computed efficiently by Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) iterations in practice. This paper proves the convergence of the bi-stochastically normalized graph Laplacian to manifold (weighted-)Laplacian with rates when $n$ data points are i.i.d. sampled from a general $d$-dimensional manifold embedded in a possibly high-dimensional space. Under certain joint limit of $n \\to \\infty$ and kernel bandwidth $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the point-wise convergence rate of the graph Laplacian operator (under 2-norm) is proved to be $ O( n^{-1/(d/2+3)})$ at finite large $n$ up to log factors, achieved at the scaling of $\\epsilon \\sim n^{-1/(d/2+3)} $. When the manifold data are corrupted by outlier noise, we theoretically prove the graph Laplacian point-wise consistency which matches the rate for clean manifold data up to an additional error term proportional to the boundedness of mutual inner-products of the noise vectors. Our analysis suggests that, under the setting being considered in this paper, not exact bi-stochastic normalization but an approximate one will achieve the same consistency rate. Motivated by the analysis, we propose an approximate and constrained matrix scaling problem that can be solved by SK iterations with early termination, and apply to simulated manifold data both clean and with outlier noise. Numerical experiments support our theoretical results and show the robustness of bi-stochastically normalized graph Laplacian to outlier noise. ",

    "title": "A novel adversarial learning strategy for medical image classification",
    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) techniques have been extensively utilized for medical image classification. Most DL-based classification networks are generally structured hierarchically and optimized through the minimization of a single loss function measured at the end of the networks. However, such a single loss design could potentially lead to optimization of one specific value of interest but fail to leverage informative features from intermediate layers that might benefit classification performance and reduce the risk of overfitting. Recently, auxiliary convolutional neural networks (AuxCNNs) have been employed on top of traditional classification networks to facilitate the training of intermediate layers to improve classification performance and robustness. In this study, we proposed an adversarial learning-based AuxCNN to support the training of deep neural networks for medical image classification. Two main innovations were adopted in our AuxCNN classification framework. First, the proposed AuxCNN architecture includes an image generator and an image discriminator for extracting more informative image features for medical image classification, motivated by the concept of generative adversarial network (GAN) and its impressive ability in approximating target data distribution. Second, a hybrid loss function is designed to guide the model training by incorporating different objectives of the classification network and AuxCNN to reduce overfitting. Comprehensive experimental studies demonstrated the superior classification performance of the proposed model. The effect of the network-related factors on classification performance was investigated. ",

    "title": "Adversarial Multi-Task Learning for Disentangling Timbre and Pitch in  Singing Voice Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Recently, deep learning-based generative models have been introduced to generate singing voices. One approach is to predict the parametric vocoder features consisting of explicit speech parameters. This approach has the advantage that the meaning of each feature is explicitly distinguished. Another approach is to predict mel-spectrograms for a neural vocoder. However, parametric vocoders have limitations of voice quality and the mel-spectrogram features are difficult to model because the timbre and pitch information are entangled. In this study, we propose a singing voice synthesis model with multi-task learning to use both approaches -- acoustic features for a parametric vocoder and mel-spectrograms for a neural vocoder. By using the parametric vocoder features as auxiliary features, the proposed model can efficiently disentangle and control the timbre and pitch components of the mel-spectrogram. Moreover, a generative adversarial network framework is applied to improve the quality of singing voices in a multi-singer model. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model can generate more natural singing voices than the single-task models, while performing better than the conventional parametric vocoder-based model.

    "abstract": "Precipitation governs Earth's hydroclimate, and its daily spatiotemporal fluctuations have major socioeconomic effects. Advances in Numerical weather prediction (NWP) have been measured by the improvement of forecasts for various physical fields such as temperature and pressure; however, large biases exist in precipitation prediction. We augment the output of the well-known NWP model CFSv2 with deep learning to create a hybrid model that improves short-range global precipitation at 1-, 2-, and 3-day lead times. To hybridise, we address the sphericity of the global data by using modified DLWP-CS architecture which transforms all the fields to cubed-sphere projection. Dynamical model precipitation and surface temperature outputs are fed into a modified DLWP-CS (UNET) to forecast ground truth precipitation. While CFSv2's average bias is +5 to +7 mm/day over land, the multivariate deep learning model decreases it to within -1 to +1 mm/day. Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Hurricane Ivan in 2004, China floods in 2010, India floods in 2005, and Myanmar storm Nargis in 2008 are used to confirm the substantial enhancement in the skill for the hybrid dynamical-deep learning model. CFSv2 typically shows a moderate to large bias in the spatial pattern and overestimates the precipitation at short-range time scales. The proposed deep learning augmented NWP model can address these biases and vastly improve the spatial pattern and magnitude of predicted precipitation. Deep learning enhanced CFSv2 reduces mean bias by 8x over important land regions for 1 day lead compared to CFSv2. The spatio-temporal deep learning system opens pathways to further the precision and accuracy in global short-range precipitation forecasts. ",

    "title": "Single-phase deep learning in cortico-cortical networks",
    "abstract": "The error-backpropagation (backprop) algorithm remains the most common solution to the credit assignment problem in artificial neural networks. In neuroscience, it is unclear whether the brain could adopt a similar strategy to correctly modify its synapses. Recent models have attempted to bridge this gap while being consistent with a range of experimental observations. However, these models are either unable to effectively backpropagate error signals across multiple layers or require a multi-phase learning process, neither of which are reminiscent of learning in the brain. Here, we introduce a new model, bursting cortico-cortical networks (BurstCCN), which solves these issues by integrating known properties of cortical networks namely bursting activity, short-term plasticity (STP) and dendrite-targeting interneurons. BurstCCN relies on burst multiplexing via connection-type-specific STP to propagate backprop-like error signals within deep cortical networks. These error signals are encoded at distal dendrites and induce burst-dependent plasticity as a result of excitatory-inhibitory topdown inputs. First, we demonstrate that our model can effectively backpropagate errors through multiple layers using a single-phase learning process. Next, we show both empirically and analytically that learning in our model approximates backprop-derived gradients. Finally, we demonstrate that our model is capable of learning complex image classification tasks (MNIST and CIFAR-10). Overall, our results suggest that cortical features across sub-cellular, cellular, microcircuit and systems levels jointly underlie single-phase efficient deep learning in the brain. ",

    "abstract": "We explore the use of machine learning techniques to remove the response of large volume $\\gamma$-ray detectors from experimental spectra. Segmented $\\gamma$-ray total absorption spectrometers (TAS) allow for the simultaneous measurement of individual $\\gamma$-ray energy (E$_\\gamma$) and total excitation energy (E$_x$). Analysis of TAS detector data is complicated by the fact that the E$_x$ and E$_\\gamma$ quantities are correlated, and therefore, techniques that simply unfold using E$_x$ and E$_\\gamma$ response functions independently are not as accurate. In this work, we investigate the use of conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to simultaneously unfold $E_{x}$ and $E_{\\gamma}$ data in TAS detectors. Specifically, we employ a Pix2Pix cGAN, a generative modeling technique based on recent advances in deep learning, to treat $(E_x, E_{\\gamma})$ matrix unfolding as an image-to-image translation problem. We present results for simulated and experimental matrices of single-$\\gamma$ and double-$\\gamma$ decay cascades. Our model demonstrates characterization capabilities within detector resolution limits for upwards of $90\\%$ of simulated test cases. ",
