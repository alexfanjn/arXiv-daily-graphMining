    "title": "Sentences as connection paths: A neural language architecture of  sentence structure in the brain",
    "abstract": "This article presents a neural language architecture of sentence structure in the brain, in which sentences are temporal connection paths that interconnect neural structures underlying their words. Words remain 'in-situ', hence they are always content-addressable. Arbitrary and novel sentences (with novel words) can be created with 'neural blackboards' for words and sentences. Hence, the unlimited productivity of natural language can be achieved with a 'fixed' small world like network structure. The article focuses on the neural blackboard for sentences. The architecture uses only one 'connection matrix' for binding all structural relations between words in sentences. Its ability to represent arbitrary (English) sentences is discussed in detail, based on a comprehensive analysis of them. The architecture simulates intra-cranial brain activity observed during sentence processing and fMRI observations related to sentence complexity and ambiguity. The simulations indicate that the observed effects relate to global control over the architecture, not to the sentence structures involved, which predicts higher activity differences related to complexity and ambiguity with higher comprehension capacity. Other aspects discussed are the 'intrinsic' sentence structures provided by connection paths and their relation to scope and inflection, the use of a dependency parser for control of binding, long-distance dependencies and gaps, question answering, ambiguity resolution based on backward processing without explicit backtracking, garden paths, and performance difficulties related to embeddings.

    "abstract": "Deep learning technologies have become the backbone for the development of computer vision. With further explorations, deep neural networks have been found vulnerable to well-designed adversarial attacks. Most of the vision devices are equipped with image signal processing (ISP) pipeline to implement RAW-to-RGB transformations and embedded into data preprocessing module for efficient image processing. Actually, ISP pipeline can introduce adversarial behaviors to post-capture images while data preprocessing may destroy attack patterns. However, none of the existing adversarial attacks takes into account the impacts of both ISP pipeline and data preprocessing. In this paper, we develop an image-scaling attack targeting on ISP pipeline, where the crafted adversarial RAW can be transformed into attack image that presents entirely different appearance once being scaled to a specific-size image. We first consider the gradient-available ISP pipeline, i.e., the gradient information can be directly used in the generation process of adversarial RAW to launch the attack. To make the adversarial attack more applicable, we further consider the gradient-unavailable ISP pipeline, in which a proxy model that well learns the RAW-to-RGB transformations is proposed as the gradient oracles. Extensive experiments show that the proposed adversarial attacks can craft adversarial RAW data against the target ISP pipelines with high attack rates. ",

    "abstract": "An autonomous system's perception engine must provide an accurate understanding of the environment for it to make decisions. Deep learning based object detection networks experience degradation in the performance and robustness for small and far away objects due to a reduction in object's feature map as we move to higher layers of the network. In this work, we propose a novel radar-guided spatial attention for RGB images to improve the perception quality of autonomous vehicles operating in a dynamic environment. In particular, our method improves the perception of small and long range objects, which are often not detected by the object detectors in RGB mode. The proposed method consists of two RGB object detectors, namely the Primary detector and a lightweight Secondary detector. The primary detector takes a full RGB image and generates primary detections. Next, the radar proposal framework creates regions of interest (ROIs) for object proposals by projecting the radar point cloud onto the 2D RGB image. These ROIs are cropped and fed to the secondary detector to generate secondary detections which are then fused with the primary detections via non-maximum suppression. This method helps in recovering the small objects by preserving the object's spatial features through an increase in their receptive field. We evaluate our fusion method on the challenging nuScenes dataset and show that our fusion method with SSD-lite as primary and secondary detector improves the baseline primary yolov3 detector's recall by 14% while requiring three times fewer computational resources.

We propose a framework which implements do-operation by swapping latent cause and effect factors encoded from a pair of inputs. Moreover, we also identify the inadequacy of existing causal representation metrics empirically and theoretically, and introduce new metrics for better evaluation.

    "abstract": "Multilayer networks describe the rich ways in which nodes are related through different types of connections in separate layers. These multiple relationships are naturally represented by an adjacency tensor that can be interpreted using techniques from multilinear algebra. In this work we propose the use of the nonnegative Tucker decomposition (NNTuck) with KL-divergence as an expressive factor model for multilayer networks that naturally generalizes existing methods for stochastic block models of multilayer networks. We show how the NNTuck provides an intuitive factor-based perspective on layer dependence and enables linear-algebraic techniques for analyzing dependence with respect to specific layers. Algorithmically, we show that using expectation maximization (EM) to maximize this log-likelihood under the NNTuck model is step-by-step equivalent to tensorial multiplicative updates for the nonnegative Tucker decomposition under a KL loss, extending a previously known equivalence from nonnegative matrices to nonnegative tensors. Using both synthetic and real-world data, we evaluate the use and interpretation of the NNTuck as a model of multilayer networks. The ability to quantify dependencies between layers has the potential to inform survey instruments for collecting social network data, identify redundancies in the structure of a network, and indicate relationships between disparate layers. Therefore, we propose a definition of layer dependence based on using a likelihood ratio test to evaluate three nested models: the layer independent, layer dependent, and layer redundant NNTucks. We show how these definitions, paired with analysis of the factor matrices in the NNTuck, can be used to understand and interpret layer dependence in different contexts. ",

Reasoning-based methods with complex reasoning mechanisms, such as reinforcement learning-based sequential decision making, have been regarded as the default pathway for this task.

In this paper, we propose QAGCN - a simple but effective and novel model that leverages attentional graph convolutional networks that can perform multi-step reasoning during the encoding of knowledge graphs. As a consequence, complex reasoning mechanisms are avoided. In addition, to improve efficiency, we retrieve answers using highly-efficient embedding computations and, for better interpretability, we extract interpretable paths for returned answers. On widely adopted benchmark datasets, the proposed model has been demonstrated competitive against state-of-the-art methods that rely on complex reasoning mechanisms.

Such mislabeled samples would raise suspicion upon human inspection, potentially revealing the attack. To improve the stealthiness of textual backdoor attacks, we propose the first clean-label framework Kallima for synthesizing mimesis-style backdoor samples to develop insidious textual backdoor attacks.

This conflict resolution method is built upon temporal-logic-based reactive synthesis to guarantee safety and task completion under specific environment assumptions. In heterogeneous multi-agent systems, every agent is expected to complete its own tasks in service of a global team objective. However, at runtime, an agent may encounter un-modeled obstacles (e.g., doors or walls) that prevent it from achieving its own task. To address this problem, we take advantage of the capability of other heterogeneous agents to resolve the obstacle. A controller framework is proposed to redirect agents with the capability of resolving the appropriate obstacles to the required target when such a situation is detected. A set of case studies involving a bipedal robot Digit and a quadcopter are used to evaluate the controller performance in action. Additionally, we implement the proposed framework on a physical multi-agent robotic system to demonstrate its viability for real world applications. ",

Large-scale online programming contests attract millions of experienced programmers to compete against each other. Competition-level programming problems are challenging in nature, and participants often fail to solve the problem on their first attempt. Some online platforms for competitive programming allow programmers to practice on competition-level problems as well, and the standard feedback for an incorrect practice submission is the first test case that the submission fails. Often, the failed test case does not provide programmers with enough information to resolve the errors in their code, and they abandon the problem after several more unsuccessful attempts. We present Clef, the first data-driven tool that can generate feedback on competition-level code automatically by repairing programmers' incorrect submissions. The key development is that Clef can learn how to generate repairs for incorrect submissions by examining the repairs that other programmers made to their own submissions over time. Since the differences between an incorrect program and a correct program for the same task may be significant, we introduce a new data structure, merge trees, to capture the changes between submissions. Merge trees are versatile: they can encode both large algorithm-level redesigns and small statement-level alterations. Clef applies the patterns it learns from a database of submissions to generate repairs for new submissions outside the database. We evaluated Clef on six real-world problems from Codeforces, the world's largest platform for competitive programming. Clef achieves 42.1% accuracy in repairing programmers' incorrect submissions. Even when given incorrect submissions from programmers who never found the solution to a problem on their own, Clef repairs the users' programs 34.1% of the time. ",

However, this assumption does not hold for biomedical imaging systems where sensor-based sources of noise are proportional to signal strengths, and the noise is better represented as a Poisson process. In this work, we explore a sparsity and dictionary learning-based approach and present a novel self-supervised learning method for single-image denoising where the noise is approximated as a Poisson process, requiring no clean ground-truth data. Specifically, we approximate traditional iterative optimization algorithms for image denoising with a recurrent neural network which enforces sparsity with respect to the weights of the network. Since the sparse representations are based on the underlying image, it is able to suppress the spurious components (noise) in the image patches, thereby introducing implicit regularization for denoising task through the network structure. Experiments on two bio-imaging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of PSNR and SSIM.

As a result, deep learning techniques, such as neural networks, have recently been developed to improve computational efficiency in solving large-scale OPF problems. However, the feasibility and optimality of the solution may not be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose an optimization model-informed generative adversarial network (MI-GAN) framework to solve OPF under uncertainty. The main contributions are summarized into three aspects: (1) to ensure feasibility and improve optimality of generated solutions, three important layers are proposed: feasibility filter layer, comparison layer, and gradient-guided layer; (2) in the GAN-based framework, an efficient model-informed selector incorporating these three new layers is established; and (3) a new recursive iteration algorithm is also proposed to improve solution optimality.

The latter is based on implicitly learning the nonlinear behavior of the system via the representer theorem. Instead of seeking a model and then performing control design, our method goes directly from data to control. This allows us to robustify the control inputs against the uncertainties in data by considering a min-max optimization problem to calculate the optimal control sequence. We show that by incorporating a proper uncertainty set, this min-max problem can be reformulated as a nonconvex but structured minimization problem. By exploiting its structure, we present a projected gradient descent algorithm to effectively solve this problem. Finally, we test the RoKDeePC on two nonlinear example systems - one academic case study and a grid-forming converter feeding a nonlinear load - and compare it with some existing nonlinear data-driven predictive control methods.

To this end, adaptive power allocation techniques can provide good performance with low computational cost. This work presents novel robust and adaptive power allocation technique for RS-based multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. In particular, we develop a robust adaptive power allocation based on stochastic gradient learning and the minimization of the mean-square error between the transmitted symbols of the RS system and the received signal. The proposed robust power allocation strategy incorporates knowledge of the variance of the channel errors to deal with imperfect CSIT and adjust power levels in the presence of uncertainty. An analysis of the convexity and stability of the proposed power allocation algorithms is provided, together with a study of their computational complexity and theoretical bounds relating the power allocation strategies. Numerical results show that the sum-rate of an RS system with adaptive power allocation outperforms RS and conventional MU-MIMO systems under imperfect CSIT. %\\vspace{-0.75em} ",

    "abstract": "We expose the danger of reward poisoning in offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), whereby an attacker can modify the reward vectors to different learners in an offline data set while incurring a poisoning cost. Based on the poisoned data set, all rational learners using some confidence-bound-based MARL algorithm will infer that a target policy - chosen by the attacker and not necessarily a solution concept originally - is the Markov perfect dominant strategy equilibrium for the underlying Markov Game, hence they will adopt this potentially damaging target policy in the future. We characterize the exact conditions under which the attacker can install a target policy. We further show how the attacker can formulate a linear program to minimize its poisoning cost. Our work shows the need for robust MARL against adversarial attacks. ",

These models aim at capturing user interest from different perspectives, including user interest evolution, session interest, multiple interests, etc. In this paper, we focus on a new type of user interest, i.e., user retargeting interest. User retargeting interest is defined as user's click interest on target items the same as or similar to historical click items. We propose a novel soft retargeting network (SRN) to model this specific interest. Specifically, we first calculate the similarity between target item and each historical item with the help of graph embedding. Then we learn to aggregate the similarity weights to measure the extent of user's click interest on target item. Furthermore, we model the evolution of user retargeting interest. Experimental results on public datasets and industrial dataset demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art models. ",

Recent studies have devised effective black-box attacks with high query efficiency. However, such performance is often accompanied by compromises in attack imperceptibility, hindering the practical use of these approaches. In this paper, we propose to restrict the perturbations to a small salient region to generate adversarial examples that can hardly be perceived. This approach is readily compatible with many existing black-box attacks and can significantly improve their imperceptibility with little degradation in attack success rate. Further, we propose the Saliency Attack, a new black-box attack aiming to refine the perturbations in the salient region to achieve even better imperceptibility. Extensive experiments show that compared to the state-of-the-art black-box attacks, our approach achieves much better imperceptibility scores, including most apparent distortion (MAD), $L_0$ and $L_2$ distances, and also obtains significantly higher success rates judged by a human-like threshold on MAD. Importantly, the perturbations generated by our approach are interpretable to some extent. Finally, it is also demonstrated to be robust to different detection-based defenses. ",

It has been said that players in a 90-min game do not have the ball for about 87 minutes on average. However, it has remained difficult to evaluate an attacking player without receiving the ball, and to reveal how movement contributes to the creation of scoring opportunities for teammates. In this paper, we evaluate players who create off-ball scoring opportunities by comparing actual movements with the reference movements generated via trajectory prediction. First, we predict the trajectories of players using a graph variational recurrent neural network that can accurately model the relationship between players and predict the long-term trajectory. Next, based on the difference in the modified off-ball evaluation index between the actual and the predicted trajectory as a reference, we evaluate how the actual movement contributes to scoring opportunity compared to the predicted movement. For verification, we examined the relationship with the annual salary, the goals, and the rating in the game by experts for all games of a team in a professional soccer league in a year. The results show that the annual salary and the proposed indicator correlated significantly, which could not be explained by the existing indicators and goals. Our results suggest the effectiveness of the proposed method as an indicator for a player without the ball to create a scoring chance for teammates. ",

Estimating the individual treatment effect (ITE) using counterfactual long-term prediction is practical to evaluate such interventions. However, most of the conventional frameworks did not consider the time-varying complex structure of multi-agent relationships and covariate counterfactual prediction. This may sometimes lead to erroneous assessments of ITE and interpretation problems. Here we propose an interpretable, counterfactual recurrent network in multi-agent systems to estimate the effect of the intervention. Our model leverages graph variational recurrent neural networks and theory-based computation with domain knowledge for the ITE estimation framework based on long-term prediction of multi-agent covariates and outcomes, which can confirm under the circumstances under which the intervention is effective. On simulated models of an automated vehicle and biological agents with time-varying confounders, we show that our methods achieved lower estimation errors in counterfactual covariates and the most effective treatment timing than the baselines. Furthermore, using real basketball data, our methods performed realistic counterfactual predictions and evaluated the counterfactual passes in shot scenarios. ",

The advancement in neural network architectures over the last decade has led to significant improvement in their performance. It sparked an interest in their deployment for real-time applications. This process initiated the need to understand the vulnerability of these models to adversarial attacks. It is instrumental in designing models that are robust against adversaries. Recent works have proposed novel techniques to counter the adversaries, most often sacrificing natural accuracy. Most suggest training with an adversarial version of the inputs, constantly moving away from the original distribution. The focus of our work is to use abstract certification to extract a subset of inputs for (hence we call it 'soft') adversarial training. We propose a training framework that can retain natural accuracy without sacrificing robustness in a constrained setting. Our framework specifically targets moderately critical applications which require a reasonable balance between robustness and accuracy. The results testify to the idea of soft adversarial training for the defense against adversarial attacks. At last, we propose the scope of future work for further improvement of this framework. ",

Specifically, the performance comparison and advantages of HSFL and HFSL are analyzed generally. Promising open research directions are presented to offer commendable reference for future research. Finally, primary simulations are conducted upon considering three datasets under non-independent and identically distributed settings, to verify the feasibility of our proposed architectures, which can significantly reduce communication/computation cost and training time, as compared with conventional FL and SL.

In this paper, motivated by a proliferation of options of alignment regularizations, we seek to evaluate the performances of several popular design choices along the dimensions of robustness and invariance, for which we introduce a new test procedure. Our synthetic experiment results speak to the benefits of squared l2 norm regularization. Further, we also formally analyze the behavior of alignment regularization to complement our empirical study under assumptions we consider realistic. Finally, we test this simple technique we identify (worst-case data augmentation with squared l2 norm alignment regularization) and show that the benefits of this method outrun those of the specially designed methods.

However, current deep learning faces major challenges for such applications because of the huge computational cost and the inefficient learning. Hence, we develop a novel brain-inspired Spiking Neural Network (SNN) based system titled Spiking Gating Flow (SGF) for online action learning. The developed system consists of multiple SGF units which assembled in a hierarchical manner. A single SGF unit involves three layers: a feature extraction layer, an event-driven layer and a histogram-based training layer. To demonstrate the developed system capabilities, we employ a standard Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) gesture classification as a benchmark. The results indicate that we can achieve 87.5% accuracy which is comparable with Deep Learning (DL), but at smaller training/inference data number ratio 1.5:1. And only a single training epoch is required during the learning process. Meanwhile, to the best of our knowledge, this is the highest accuracy among the non-backpropagation algorithm based SNNs. At last, we conclude the few-shot learning paradigm of the developed network: 1) a hierarchical structure-based network design involves human prior knowledge; 2) SNNs for content based global dynamic feature detection.

However, existing deep-learning-based instance segmentation methods have been mostly developed based on public datasets, which largely omit heavy occlusion problems; therefore, these methods have limitations in real-world applications involving object occlusions, such as farrowing pen systems used on pig farms in which the farrowing crates often impede the sow and piglets. In this paper, we propose a novel occlusion-resistant Center Clustering Network for instance segmentation, dubbed as CClusnet-Inseg. Specifically, CClusnet-Inseg uses each pixel to predict object centers and trace these centers to form masks based on clustering results, which consists of a network for segmentation and center offset vector map, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, Centers-to-Mask (C2M) and Remain-Centers-to-Mask (RC2M) algorithms, and a pseudo-occlusion generator (POG). In all, 4,600 images were extracted from six videos collected from six farrowing pens to train and validate our method. CClusnet-Inseg achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 83.6; it outperformed YOLACT++ and Mask R-CNN, which had mAP values of 81.2 and 74.7, respectively. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of core modules of our method. In addition, we apply CClusnet-Inseg to multi-object tracking for animal monitoring, and the predicted object center that is a conjunct output could serve as an occlusion-resistant representation of the location of an object.

    "abstract": "Recent years have seen a surge of interest in meta-learning techniques for tackling the few-shot learning (FSL) problem. However, the meta-learner is prone to overfitting since there are only a few available samples, which can be identified as sampling noise on a clean dataset. Moreover, when handling the data with noisy labels, the meta-learner could be extremely sensitive to label noise on a corrupted dataset. To address these two challenges, we present Eigen-Reptile (ER) that updates the meta-parameters with the main direction of historical task-specific parameters to alleviate sampling and label noise. Specifically, the main direction is computed in a fast way, where the scale of the calculated matrix is related to the number of gradient steps instead of the number of parameters. Furthermore, to obtain a more accurate main direction for Eigen-Reptile in the presence of many noisy labels, we further propose Introspective Self-paced Learning (ISPL). We have theoretically and experimentally demonstrated the soundness and effectiveness of the proposed Eigen-Reptile and ISPL. Particularly, our experiments on different tasks show that the proposed method is able to outperform or achieve highly competitive performance compared with other gradient-based methods with or without noisy labels.

This means, for example, including parts-of-speech or dependency information within the used lexical features. The word embeddings can then be trained on the combinations instead of just raw tokens. It is also possible to later apply this method to the pre-training of huge language models and possibly enhance their performance.

    "abstract": "For the purpose of maximizing the spread of influence caused by a certain small number k of nodes in a social network, we are asked to find a k-subset of nodes (i.e., a seed set) with the best capacity to influence the nodes not in it. This problem of influence maximization (IM) has wide application, belongs to subset problems, and is NP-hard. To solve it, we should theoretically examine all seed sets and evaluate their influence spreads, which is time-consuming. Therefore, metaheuristic strategies are generally employed to gain a good seed set within a reasonable time. We observe that many algorithms for the IM problem only adopt a uniform mechanism in the whole solution search process, which lacks a response measure when the algorithm becomes trapped in a local optimum. To address this issue, we propose a phased hybrid evaluation-enhanced (PHEE) approach for IM, which utilizes two distinct search strategies to enhance the search of optimal solutions: a randomized range division evolutionary (RandRDE) algorithm to improve the solution quality, and a fast convergence strategy. Our approach is evaluated on 10 real-world social networks of different sizes and types. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is efficient and obtains the best influence spread for all the datasets compared with three state-of-the-art algorithms, outperforms the time consuming CELF algorithm on four datasets, and performs worse than CELF on only two networks.

    "abstract": "Automatic generation of ophthalmic reports using data-driven neural networks has great potential in clinical practice. When writing a report, ophthalmologists make inferences with prior clinical knowledge. This knowledge has been neglected in prior medical report generation methods. To endow models with the capability of incorporating expert knowledge, we propose a Cross-modal clinical Graph Transformer (CGT) for ophthalmic report generation (ORG), in which clinical relation triples are injected into the visual features as prior knowledge to drive the decoding procedure. However, two major common Knowledge Noise (KN) issues may affect models' effectiveness. 1) Existing general biomedical knowledge bases such as the UMLS may not align meaningfully to the specific context and language of the report, limiting their utility for knowledge injection. 2) Incorporating too much knowledge may divert the visual features from their correct meaning. To overcome these limitations, we design an automatic information extraction scheme based on natural language processing to obtain clinical entities and relations directly from in-domain training reports. Given a set of ophthalmic images, our CGT first restores a sub-graph from the clinical graph and injects the restored triples into visual features. Then visible matrix is employed during the encoding procedure to limit the impact of knowledge. Finally, reports are predicted by the encoded cross-modal features via a Transformer decoder. Extensive experiments on the large-scale FFA-IR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed CGT is able to outperform previous benchmark methods and achieve state-of-the-art performances. ",

Different from all prior studies on causal bandits, CCB needs to deal with exponentially large action space. We study under the context of binary generalized linear models (BGLMs) with a succinct parametric representation of the causal models. We present the algorithm BGLM-OFU for Markovian BGLMs (i.e. no hidden variables) based on the maximum likelihood estimation method, and show that it achieves $O(\\sqrt{T}\\log T)$ regret, where $T$ is the time horizon. For the special case of linear models with hidden variables, we apply causal inference techniques such as the do-calculus to convert the original model into a Markovian model, and then show that our BGLM-OFU algorithm and another algorithm based on the linear regression both solve such linear models with hidden variables. Our novelty includes (a) considering the combinatorial intervention action space, (b) considering general causal models including ones with hidden variables, (c) integrating and adapting techniques from diverse studies such as generalized linear bandits and online influence maximization, and (d) not relying on unrealistic assumptions such as knowing the joint distribution of the parents of $Y$ under all interventions used in some prior studies.

    "abstract": "Most recent self-supervised learning methods learn visual representation by contrasting different augmented views of images. Compared with supervised learning, more aggressive augmentations have been introduced to further improve the diversity of training pairs. However, aggressive augmentations may distort images' structures leading to a severe semantic shift problem that augmented views of the same image may not share the same semantics, thus degrading the transfer performance. To address this problem, we propose a new SSL paradigm, which counteracts the impact of semantic shift by balancing the role of weak and aggressively augmented pairs. Specifically, semantically inconsistent pairs are of minority and we treat them as noisy pairs. Note that deep neural networks (DNNs) have a crucial memorization effect that DNNs tend to first memorize clean (majority) examples before overfitting to noisy (minority) examples. Therefore, we set a relatively large weight for aggressively augmented data pairs at the early learning stage. With the training going on, the model begins to overfit noisy pairs. Accordingly, we gradually reduce the weights of aggressively augmented pairs. In doing so, our method can better embrace the aggressive augmentations and neutralize the semantic shift problem. Experiments show that our model achieves 73.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ResNet-50 for 200 epochs, which is a 2.5% improvement over BYOL. Moreover, experiments also demonstrate that the learned representations can transfer well for various downstream tasks. ",

We show how this is likely traced to instabilities of the optimization dynamics that are restrained, i.e., localized over iterations and regions of the weight tensor space. We do this by presenting a theoretical framework using numerical analysis of partial differential equations (PDE), and analyzing the gradient descent PDE of a simplified convolutional neural network (CNN).

    "abstract": "Machine learning approaches commonly rely on the assumption of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data. In reality, however, this assumption is almost always violated due to distribution shifts between environments. Although valuable learning signals can be provided by heterogeneous data from changing distributions, it is also known that learning under arbitrary (adversarial) changes is impossible. Causality provides a useful framework for modeling distribution shifts, since causal models encode both observational and interventional distributions. In this work, we explore the sparse mechanism shift hypothesis, which posits that distribution shifts occur due to a small number of changing causal conditionals. Motivated by this idea, we apply it to learning causal structure from heterogeneous environments, where i.i.d. data only allows for learning an equivalence class of graphs without restrictive assumptions. We propose the Mechanism Shift Score (MSS), a score-based approach amenable to various empirical estimators, which provably identifies the entire causal structure with high probability if the sparse mechanism shift hypothesis holds. Empirically, we verify behavior predicted by the theory and compare multiple estimators and score functions to identify the best approaches in practice. Compared to other methods, we show how MSS bridges a gap by both being nonparametric as well as explicitly leveraging sparse changes. ",

The $L^2$ Physics-Informed Loss is the de-facto standard in training Physics-Informed Neural Networks.

In particular, we leverage the concept of stability in the literature of partial differential equation to study the asymptotic behavior of the learned solution as the loss approaches zero. With this concept, we study an important class of high-dimensional non-linear PDEs in optimal control, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman(HJB) Equation, and prove that for general $L^p$ Physics-Informed Loss, a wide class of HJB equation is stable only if $p$ is sufficiently large. Therefore, the commonly used $L^2$ loss is not suitable for training PINN on those equations, while $L^{\\infty}$ loss is a better choice. Based on the theoretical insight, we develop a novel PINN training algorithm to minimize the $L^{\\infty}$ loss for HJB equations which is in a similar spirit to adversarial training.

We efficiently express the obstacle shape as the zero-level set of a signed distance function which is implicitly determined by a small number of network parameters. To solve the direct scattering problem, we implement the implicit boundary integral method. It uses projections of the grid points in the tubular neighborhood onto the boundary to compute the PDE solution instead of a grid-size-dependent extraction method of surface points such as Marching Cubes. The implicit representation conveniently handles the shape perturbation in the optimization process. To update the shape, we use PyTorch's automatic differentiation to backpropagate the loss function w.r.t. the network parameters, allowing us to avoid complex and error-prone manual derivation of the shape derivative. The proposed framework makes the inverse scattering problem more tractable with fewer parameters to optimize in comparison to the memory-inefficient grid-based approaches and outputs high-quality reconstruction results.

    "abstract": "Neural replicator dynamics (NeuRD) is an alternative to the foundational softmax policy gradient (SPG) algorithm motivated by online learning and evolutionary game theory. The NeuRD expected update is designed to be nearly identical to that of SPG, however, we show that the Monte Carlo updates differ in a substantial way: the importance correction accounting for a sampled action is nullified in the SPG update, but not in the NeuRD update. Naturally, this causes the NeuRD update to have higher variance than its SPG counterpart. Building on implicit exploration algorithms in the adversarial bandit setting, we introduce capped implicit exploration (CIX) estimates that allow us to construct NeuRD-CIX, which interpolates between this aspect of NeuRD and SPG. We show how CIX estimates can be used in a black-box reduction to construct bandit algorithms with regret bounds that hold with high probability and the benefits this entails for NeuRD-CIX in sequential decision-making settings. Our analysis reveals a bias--variance tradeoff between SPG and NeuRD, and shows how theory predicts that NeuRD-CIX will perform well more consistently than NeuRD while retaining NeuRD's advantages over SPG in non-stationary environments.

    "abstract": "Humans can make predictions on various time scales and hierarchical levels. Thereby, the learning of event encodings seems to play a crucial role. In this work we model the development of hierarchical predictions via autonomously learned latent event codes. We present a hierarchical recurrent neural network architecture, whose inductive learning biases foster the development of sparsely changing latent state that compress sensorimotor sequences. A higher level network learns to predict the situations in which the latent states tend to change. Using a simulated robotic manipulator, we demonstrate that the system (i) learns latent states that accurately reflect the event structure of the data, (ii) develops meaningful temporal abstract predictions on the higher level, and (iii) generates goal-anticipatory behavior similar to gaze behavior found in eye-tracking studies with infants. The architecture offers a step towards autonomous, self-motivated learning of compressed hierarchical encodings of gathered experiences and the exploitation of these encodings for the generation of highly versatile, adaptive behavior.

We show that, for a specific set of ground-truth functions (which we refer to as the \"learnable set\"), the test error of the overfitted 3-layer NTK is upper bounded by an expression that decreases with the number of neurons of the two hidden layers. Different from 2-layer NTK where there exists only one hidden-layer, the 3-layer NTK involves interactions between two hidden-layers. Our upper bound reveals that, between the two hidden-layers, the test error descends faster with respect to the number of neurons in the second hidden-layer (the one closer to the output) than with respect to that in the first hidden-layer (the one closer to the input). We also show that the learnable set of 3-layer NTK without bias is no smaller than that of 2-layer NTK models with various choices of bias in the neurons. However, in terms of the actual generalization performance, our results suggest that 3-layer NTK is much less sensitive to the choices of bias than 2-layer NTK, especially when the input dimension is large.

Furthermore, the transparency of these models increase trust among application domain experts. Medical datasets face common issues such as heterogeneous measurements, imbalanced classes with limited sample size, and missing data, which hinder the straightforward application of machine learning techniques. In this paper we present a family of prototype-based (PB) interpretable models which are capable of handling these issues. The models introduced in this contribution show comparable or superior performance to alternative techniques applicable in such situations. However, unlike ensemble based models, which have to compromise on easy interpretation, the PB models here do not. Moreover we propose a strategy of harnessing the power of ensembles while maintaining the intrinsic interpretability of the PB models, by averaging the model parameter manifolds. All the models were evaluated on a synthetic (publicly available dataset) in addition to detailed analyses of two real-world medical datasets (one publicly available). Results indicated that the models and strategies we introduced addressed the challenges of real-world medical data, while remaining computationally inexpensive and transparent, as well as similar or superior in performance compared to their alternatives.

In this work, we propose a general and provably powerful GNN framework that preserves the scalability of message passing scheme. In particular, we first propose to empower 1-WL for graph isomorphism test by considering edges among neighbors, giving rise to NC-1-WL. The expressiveness of NC-1-WL is shown to be strictly above 1-WL but below 3-WL theoretically. Further, we propose the NC-GNN framework as a differentiable neural version of NC-1-WL. Our simple implementation of NC-GNN is provably as powerful as NC-1-WL. Experiments demonstrate that our NC-GNN achieves remarkable performance on various benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "With the recent rise in awareness about advancing towards a sustainable future, electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming more popular. As there are way fewer charging stations than EVs, range anxiety plays a major role in the rising number of queries made by EVs along their journeys to find the nearest available charging station, and such online querying is handled by third-party service providers and communicated via the Edge cloud. On the other hand, with the recent drive towards an information-based society, the use of personal data in various analytics is surging like never before. Hence, the risk of privacy violation of data is also increasing. One of the recently popularised methods formalising utility-preserving location privacy is geo-indistinguishability, a generalisation of the local differential privacy, which is the state-of-the-art standard for privacy protection. However, the noise should be calibrated carefully, taking into account the implications for potential utility-loss for the users affecting their quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we consider EVs dynamically querying about charging stations along their journeys, and we theorize approximate geo-indistinguishability (AGeoI) on road networks which allows the EVs to obfuscate the individual query locations while keeping them within their preferred area of interest, as journeys are very sensitive to a sharp loss in QoS incurring a high cost to be covered. We propose a novel method to protect the privacy of EVs, both for the individual query locations and against the threat of tracing their journeys, by applying AGeoI that enables the users to substantially preserve their QoS. We lay out an analytical insight on our method and experimentally illustrate that under our method a very high fraction of the EVs attain privacy for free, and, in general, the utility-loss suffered due to gain in privacy is significantly low.

    "abstract": "Causal discovery and causal reasoning are classically treated as separate and consecutive tasks: one first infers the causal graph, and then uses it to estimate causal effects of interventions. However, such a two-stage approach is uneconomical, especially in terms of actively collected interventional data, since the causal query of interest may not require a fully-specified causal model. From a Bayesian perspective, it is also unnatural, since a causal query (e.g., the causal graph or some causal effect) can be viewed as a latent quantity subject to posterior inference -- other unobserved quantities that are not of direct interest (e.g., the full causal model) ought to be marginalized out in this process and contribute to our epistemic uncertainty. In this work, we propose Active Bayesian Causal Inference (ABCI), a fully-Bayesian active learning framework for integrated causal discovery and reasoning, which jointly infers a posterior over causal models and queries of interest. In our approach to ABCI, we focus on the class of causally-sufficient, nonlinear additive noise models, which we model using Gaussian processes. We sequentially design experiments that are maximally informative about our target causal query, collect the corresponding interventional data, and update our beliefs to choose the next experiment. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our approach is more data-efficient than several baselines that only focus on learning the full causal graph. This allows us to accurately learn downstream causal queries from fewer samples while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for the quantities of interest. ",

However, direct fusion of low-level details and high-level semantics will lead to a phenomenon that the detailed features are easily overwhelmed by surrounding contextual information, namely overshoot in this paper, which limits the improvement of the accuracy of existed two-branch models. In this paper, we bridge a connection between Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller and reveal that the two-branch network is nothing but a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller, which inherently suffers from the similar overshoot issue. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel three-branch network architecture: PIDNet, which possesses three branches to parse the detailed, context and boundary information (derivative of semantics), respectively, and employs boundary attention to guide the fusion of detailed and context branches in final stage. The family of PIDNets achieve the best trade-off between inference speed and accuracy and their test accuracy surpasses all the existed models with similar inference speed on Cityscapes, CamVid and COCO-Stuff datasets. Especially, PIDNet-S achieves 78.6% mIOU with inference speed of 93.2 FPS on Cityscapes test set and 81.6% mIOU with speed of 153.7 FPS on CamVid test set. ",

    "abstract": "With recent progress in deep generative models, the problem of identifying synthetic data and comparing their underlying generative processes has become an imperative task for various reasons, including fighting visual misinformation and source attribution. Existing methods often approximate the distance between the models via their sample distributions. In this paper, we approach the problem of fingerprinting generative models by learning representations that encode the residual artifacts left by the generative models as unique signals that identify the source models. We consider these unique traces (a.k.a. \"artificial fingerprints\") as representations of generative models, and demonstrate their usefulness in both the discriminative task of source attribution and the unsupervised task of defining a similarity between the underlying models. We first extend the existing studies on fingerprints of GANs to four representative classes of generative models (VAEs, Flows, GANs and score-based models), and demonstrate their existence and attributability. We then improve the stability and attributability of the fingerprints by proposing a new learning method based on set-encoding and contrastive training. Our set-encoder, unlike existing methods that operate on individual images, learns fingerprints from a \\textit{set} of images. We demonstrate improvements in the stability and attributability through comparisons to state-of-the-art fingerprint methods and ablation studies. Further, our method employs contrastive training to learn an implicit similarity between models. We discover latent families of generative models using this metric in a standard hierarchical clustering algorithm. ",

However, the extra latency and memory costs introduced by this approach may make it unacceptable for efficiency-constrained applications. It has recently been shown for bilingual translation that using a deep encoder and shallow decoder (DESD) can reduce inference latency while maintaining translation quality, so we study similar speed-accuracy trade-offs for multilingual translation. We find that for many-to-one translation we can indeed increase decoder speed without sacrificing quality using this approach, but for one-to-many translation, shallow decoders cause a clear quality drop. To ameliorate this drop, we propose a deep encoder with multiple shallow decoders (DEMSD) where each shallow decoder is responsible for a disjoint subset of target languages. Specifically, the DEMSD model with 2-layer decoders is able to obtain a 1.8x speedup on average compared to a standard transformer model with no drop in translation quality. ",

We also find that an arbitrary positioning of weights can degrade ESN performance and variance; and that this can be remedied in particular by employing connectome-derived weight positions. Herein we consider four connectome features -- namely, the sparsity, positioning, distribution, and clustering of weights -- and construct corresponding model classes (A, B, B${}_2$, C) from an appropriate null model ESN; one with its reservoir layer replaced by a fruit fly connectivity matrix.

In contrast, we leverage the differentiability property of the AIL reward function and formulate a class of Actor Residual Critic (ARC) RL algorithms that draw a parallel to the standard Actor-Critic (AC) algorithms in RL literature and uses a residual critic, C function (instead of the standard Q function) to approximate only the discounted future return (excluding the immediate reward). ARC algorithms have similar convergence properties as the standard AC algorithms with the additional advantage that the gradient through the immediate reward is exact. For the discrete (tabular) case with finite states, actions, and known dynamics, we prove that policy iteration with $C$ function converges to an optimal policy. In the continuous case with function approximation and unknown dynamics, we experimentally show that ARC aided AIL outperforms standard AIL in simulated continuous-control and real robotic manipulation tasks.

To perform efficient online inference, representation quantization, aiming to embed the latent features by a compact sequence of discrete numbers, recently shows the promising potentiality in optimizing both memory and computation overheads.

In this paper, we propose a novel quantization framework to learn Binarized Graph Representations for Top-K Recommendation (BiGeaR). BiGeaR introduces multi-faceted quantization reinforcement at the pre-, mid-, and post-stage of binarized representation learning, which substantially retains the representation informativeness against embedding binarization. In addition to saving the memory footprint, BiGeaR further develops solid online inference acceleration with bitwise operations, providing alternative flexibility for the realistic deployment. The empirical results over five large real-world benchmarks show that BiGeaR achieves about 22%~40% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art quantization-based recommender system, and recovers about 95%~102% of the performance capability of the best full-precision counterpart with over 8x time and space reduction.

Recently, vision transformers have been found to be effective in many computer vision tasks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no work that studied the feasibility of AT in a FL process for vision transformers. This paper investigates such feasibility with different federated model aggregation methods and different vision transformer models with different tokenization and classification head techniques. In order to improve the robust accuracy of the models with the not independent and identically distributed (Non-IID), we propose an extension to FedAvg aggregation method, called FedWAvg.

    "abstract": "The convergence of GD and SGD when training mildly parameterized neural networks starting from random initialization is studied. For a broad range of models and loss functions, including the most commonly used square loss and cross entropy loss, we prove an ``early stage convergence'' result. We show that the loss is decreased by a significant amount in the early stage of the training, and this decrease is fast. Furthurmore, for exponential type loss functions, and under some assumptions on the training data, we show global convergence of GD. Instead of relying on extreme over-parameterization, our study is based on a microscopic analysis of the activation patterns for the neurons, which helps us derive more powerful lower bounds for the gradient. The results on activation patterns, which we call ``neuron partition'', help build intuitions for understanding the behavior of neural networks' training dynamics, and may be of independent interest.

Our edge computing network considers a cluster of virtual machines and Raspberry Pis, and is designed to benchmark serverless functions under different hardware and network conditions.

We share the lessons learnt in engineering and implementing an open source edge computing network testbed. The measurements indicate that a properly dimensioned system can effectively deploy resource constrained edge computing devices as a serverless infrastructure.

We observe that existing GNN based methods fail to overcome challenges of scale and irregularity of points in outdoor datasets. Addressing the need to preserve structural details while learning over a larger volume efficiently, we propose Hierarchical Point Graph Neural Network (HPGNN). It learns node features at various levels of graph coarseness to extract information. This enables to learn over a large point cloud while retaining fine details that existing point-level graph networks struggle to achieve. Connections between multiple levels enable a point to learn features in multiple scales, in a few iterations. We design HPGNN as a purely GNN-based approach, so that it offers modular expandability as seen with other point-based and Graph network baselines. To illustrate the improved processing capability, we compare previous point based and GNN models for semantic segmentation with our HPGNN, achieving a significant improvement for GNNs (+36.7 mIoU) on the SemanticKITTI dataset.

    "abstract": "Adversarial training has been widely explored for mitigating attacks against deep models. However, most existing works are still trapped in the dilemma between higher accuracy and stronger robustness since they tend to fit a model towards robust features (not easily tampered with by adversaries) while ignoring those non-robust but highly predictive features. To achieve a better robustness-accuracy trade-off, we propose the Vanilla Feature Distillation Adversarial Training (VFD-Adv), which conducts knowledge distillation from a pre-trained model (optimized towards high accuracy) to guide adversarial training towards higher accuracy, i.e., preserving those non-robust but predictive features. More specifically, both adversarial examples and their clean counterparts are forced to be aligned in the feature space by distilling predictive representations from the pre-trained/clean model, while previous works barely utilize predictive features from clean models. Therefore, the adversarial training model is updated towards maximally preserving the accuracy as gaining robustness. A key advantage of our method is that it can be universally adapted to and boost existing works. Exhaustive experiments on various datasets, classification models, and adversarial training algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. ",

SCCL model aims at the lack of consideration of local features and emotional semantic features of the text in the language model that can efficiently extract text context features like BERT and GRU. Then make the following improvements to their shortcomings. On the one hand, based on BERT-BiGRU, the capsule network is introduced to extract local features while retaining good context features. On the other hand, the sentiment lexicon is introduced to extract the emotional sequence of the text to provide richer emotional semantic features for the model. To enhance the universality of the sentiment lexicon, the improved SO-PMI algorithm based on TF-IDF is used to expand the lexicon, so that the lexicon can also perform well in the field of online travel reviews.

    "abstract": "Curb space is one of the busiest areas in urban road networks. Especially in recent years, the rapid increase of ride-hailing trips and commercial deliveries has induced massive pick-ups/drop-offs (PUDOs), which occupy the limited curb space that was designed and built decades ago. These PUDOs could jam curb utilization and disturb the mainline traffic flow, evidently leading to significant societal externalities. However, there is a lack of an analytical framework that rigorously quantifies and mitigates the congestion effect of PUDOs in the system view, particularly with little data support and involvement of confounding effects. In view of this, this paper develops a rigorous causal inference approach to estimate the congestion effect of PUDOs on general networks. A causal graph is set to represent the spatio-temporal relationship between PUDOs and traffic speed, and a double and separated machine learning (DSML) method is proposed to quantify how PUDOs affect traffic congestion. Additionally, a re-routing formulation is developed and solved to encourage passenger walking and traffic flow re-routing to achieve system optimal. Numerical experiments are conducted using real-world data in the Manhattan area. On average, 100 additional units of PUDOs in a region could reduce the traffic speed by 3.70 and 4.54 mph on weekdays and weekends, respectively. Re-routing trips with PUDOs on curbs could respectively reduce the system-wide total travel time by 2.44\\% and 2.12\\% in Midtown and Central Park on weekdays. Sensitivity analysis is also conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. ",

In conversational videos, emotion can be present in multiple modalities, i.e., audio, video, and transcript. However, due to the inherent characteristics of these modalities, multi-modal ERC has always been considered a challenging undertaking. Existing ERC research focuses mainly on using text information in a discussion, ignoring the other two modalities. We anticipate that emotion recognition accuracy can be improved by employing a multi-modal approach. Thus, in this study, we propose a Multi-modal Fusion Network (M2FNet) that extracts emotion-relevant features from visual, audio, and text modality. It employs a multi-head attention-based fusion mechanism to combine emotion-rich latent representations of the input data. We introduce a new feature extractor to extract latent features from the audio and visual modality. The proposed feature extractor is trained with a novel adaptive margin-based triplet loss function to learn emotion-relevant features from the audio and visual data. In the domain of ERC, the existing methods perform well on one benchmark dataset but not on others. Our results show that the proposed M2FNet architecture outperforms all other methods in terms of weighted average F1 score on well-known MELD and IEMOCAP datasets and sets a new state-of-the-art performance in ERC.

This paper proposes a deep neural network architecture for learning such dependencies consisting of a 3D convolutional layer, fully connected (FC) layers, and attention layer, which is simpler to implement and gives a competitive performance on the UCF-101 dataset. The proposed method first learns spatial and temporal features of actions through 3D-CNN, and then the attention mechanism helps the model to locate attention to essential features for recognition.

    "abstract": "Bitcoin has emerged as a revolutionary payment system with its decentralized ledger concept; however it has significant problems such as high transaction fees and low throughput. Lightning Network (LN), which was introduced much later, solves most of these problems with an innovative concept called off-chain payments. With this advancement, Bitcoin has become an attractive venue to perform micro-payments which can also be adopted in many IoT applications (e.g., toll payments). Nevertheless, it is not feasible to host LN and Bitcoin on IoT devices due to the storage, memory, and processing restrictions. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a secure and efficient protocol that enables an IoT device to use LN's functions through an untrusted gateway node. Through this gateway which hosts the LN and Bitcoin nodes, the IoT device can open & close LN channels and send & receive LN payments. This delegation approach is powered by a threshold cryptography based scheme that requires the IoT device and the LN gateway to jointly perform all LN operations. Specifically, we propose thresholdizing LN's Bitcoin public and private keys as well as its public and private keys for the new channel states (i.e., commitment points). We prove with a game theoretical security analysis that the IoT device is secure against collusion and stealing attacks. We implemented the proposed protocol by changing LN's source code and thoroughly evaluated its performance using a Raspberry Pi. Our evaluation results show that the protocol is fast, does not bring extra cost overhead and can be run on low data-rate wireless networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that implemented threshold cryptography in LN. ",

Because of their heterogeneous representations, however, direct mapping between the two modalities -- i.e., two-dimensional (mid-sagittal slice) plus time tagged-MRI sequence and its corresponding one-dimensional waveform -- is not straightforward. Instead, we resort to two-dimensional spectrograms as an intermediate representation, which contains both pitch and resonance, from which to develop an end-to-end deep learning framework to translate from a sequence of tagged-MRI to its corresponding audio waveform with limited dataset size. Our framework is based on a novel fully convolutional asymmetry translator with guidance of a self residual attention strategy to specifically exploit the moving muscular structures during speech. In addition, we leverage a pairwise correlation of the samples with the same utterances with a latent space representation disentanglement strategy. Furthermore, we incorporate an adversarial training approach with generative adversarial networks to offer improved realism on our generated spectrograms. Our experimental results, carried out with a total of 63 tagged-MRI sequences alongside speech acoustics, showed that our framework enabled the generation of clear audio waveforms from a sequence of tagged-MRI, surpassing competing methods.

To this end, we present a new framework to prove the coding theorems for linear codes, which unifies the channel coding theorem, the source coding theorem and the joint source-channel coding (JSCC) theorem. In the presented framework, the systematic bits and the corresponding parity-check bits play different roles. Precisely, the noisy systematic bits are used to limit the list size of typical codewords, while the noisy parity-check bits are used to select from the list the maximum likelihood codeword. This new framework for linear codes allows that the systematic bits and the parity-check bits are transmitted in different ways and over different channels. With this framework, we prove that the Bernoulli generator matrix codes (BGMCs) are capacity-achieving over BIOS channels, entropy-achieving for Bernoulli sources, and also system-capacity-achieving for JSCC applications. A lower bound on the bit-error rate (BER) is derived for linear codes, which can be used to predict the error floors and hence serves as a simple tool to design the JSCC system. Numerical results show that the convolutional LDGM codes perform well in the waterfall region and match well with the derived error floors, which can be lowered down if required by simply increasing the encoding memory.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of connecting massive devices to the Internet, especially for remote areas without cellular network infrastructures, space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs) emerge and offload computation-intensive tasks. In this paper, we consider a SAGIN, where multiple low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellites providing connections to the cloud server, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and nearby base stations (BSs) providing edge computing services are included. The UAV flies along a fixed trajectory to collect tasks generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and forwards these tasks to a BS or the cloud server for further processing. To facilitate efficient processing, the UAV needs to decide where to offload as well as the proportion of offloaded tasks. However, in practice, due to the variability of environment and actual demand, the amount of arrival tasks is uncertain. If the deterministic optimization is utilized to develop offloading strategy, unnecessary system overhead or higher task drop rate may occur, which severely damages the system robustness. To address this issue, we characterize the uncertainty with a data-driven approach, and formulate a distributionally robust optimization problem to minimize the expected energy-constrained system latency under the worst-case probability distribution. Furthermore, the distributionally robust latency optimization algorithm is proposed to reach the suboptimal solution. Finally, we perform simulations on the realworld data set, and compare with other benchmark schemes to verify the efficiency and robustness of our proposed algorithm. ",

We show that our modification improve the performance of siamese networks on multi change detection datasets, and it works for both convolutional neural network and visual transformer. ",

This leads to low down the performance of hash function learning. In this paper, a hash algorithm is proposed with a hyper-class representation. It is a two-steps approach. The first step finds potential decision features and establish hyper-class. The second step constructs hash learning based on the hyper-class information in the first step, so that the hash codes of the data within the hyper-class are as similar as possible, as well as the hash codes of the data between the hyper-classes are as different as possible. To evaluate the efficiency, a series of experiments are conducted on four public datasets.

We evaluate our framework on differentiable mass-spring and material point method (MPM) simulations, with challenging locomotion tasks and multiple robot designs.

It usually involved in two steps: (1) text recognition and (2) text classification. To localize texts in videos, we can resort to large numbers of text recognition methods based on OCR technology. However, to our knowledge, there is no existing work focused on the second step of video text classification, which will limit the guidance to downstream tasks such as video indexing and browsing. In this paper, we are the first to address this new task of video text classification by fusing multimodal information to deal with the challenging scenario where different types of video texts may be confused with various colors, unknown fonts and complex layouts. In addition, we tailor a specific module called CorrelationNet to reinforce feature representation by explicitly extracting layout information. Furthermore, contrastive learning is utilized to explore inherent connections between samples using plentiful unlabeled videos. Finally, we construct a new well-defined industrial dataset from the news domain, called TI-News, which is dedicated to building and evaluating video text recognition and classification applications. Extensive experiments on TI-News demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. ",

Specifically, we observe that in-distribution data enjoy more consistent predictions for its original and augmented versions on a trained network than out-distribution data, which separates in-distribution and out-distribution samples. Experiments on various high-resolution image benchmark datasets demonstrate that TTA-AD achieves comparable or better detection performance under dataset-vs-dataset anomaly detection settings with a 60%~90\\% running time reduction of existing classifier-based algorithms. We provide empirical verification that the key to TTA-AD lies in the remaining classes between augmented features, which has long been partially ignored by previous works.

The popularity of self-supervised learning is driven by the fact that traditional models typically require a huge amount of well-annotated data for training. Acquiring annotated data can be a difficult and costly process. Self-supervised methods have been introduced to improve the efficiency of training data through discriminative pre-training of models using supervisory signals that have been freely obtained from the raw data. Unlike existing reviews of SSRL that have pre-dominately focused upon methods in the fields of CV or NLP for a single data mode, we aim to provide the first comprehensive review of multimodal self-supervised learning methods for temporal data. To this end, we 1) provide a comprehensive categorization of existing SSRL methods, 2) introduce a generic pipeline by defining the key components of a SSRL framework, 3) compare existing models in terms of their objective function, network architecture and potential applications, and 4) review existing multimodal techniques in each category and various modalities. Finally, we present existing weaknesses and future opportunities. We believe our work develops a perspective on the requirements of SSRL in domains that utilise multimodal and/or temporal data ",

    "abstract": "Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) focuses on improving the generalization ability of object detectors via knowledge transfer. Recent advances in DAOD strive to change the emphasis of the adaptation process from global to local in virtue of fine-grained feature alignment methods. However, both the global and local alignment approaches fail to capture the topological relations among different foreground objects as the explicit dependencies and interactions between and within domains are neglected. In this case, only seeking one-vs-one alignment does not necessarily ensure the precise knowledge transfer. Moreover, conventional alignment-based approaches may be vulnerable to catastrophic overfitting regarding those less transferable regions (e.g. backgrounds) due to the accumulation of inaccurate localization results in the target domain. To remedy these issues, we first formulate DAOD as an open-set domain adaptation problem, in which the foregrounds and backgrounds are seen as the ``known classes'' and ``unknown class'' respectively. Accordingly, we propose a new and general framework for DAOD, named Foreground-aware Graph-based Relational Reasoning (FGRR), which incorporates graph structures into the detection pipeline to explicitly model the intra- and inter-domain foreground object relations on both pixel and semantic spaces, thereby endowing the DAOD model with the capability of relational reasoning beyond the popular alignment-based paradigm. The inter-domain visual and semantic correlations are hierarchically modeled via bipartite graph structures, and the intra-domain relations are encoded via graph attention mechanisms. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed FGRR exceeds the state-of-the-art performance on four DAOD benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "360-degree streaming videos can provide a rich immersive experiences to the users. However, it requires an extremely high bandwidth network. One of the common solutions for saving bandwidth consumption is to stream only a portion of video covered by the user's viewport. To do that, the user's viewpoint prediction is indispensable. In existing viewport prediction methods, they mainly concentrate on the user's head movement trajectory and video saliency. None of them consider navigation information contained in the video, which can turn the attention of the user to specific regions in the video with high probability. Such information can be included in video subtitles, especially the one in 360-degree virtual tourism videos. This fact reveals the potential contribution of video subtitles to viewport prediction. Therefore, in this paper, a subtitle-based viewport prediction model for 360-degree virtual tourism videos is proposed. This model leverages the navigation information in the video subtitles in addition to head movement trajectory and video saliency, to improve the prediction accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms baseline methods which only use head movement trajectory and video saliency for viewport prediction. ",

It consists of two procedures: bidirectional pretraining and unidirectional finetuning. Both procedures utilize SimCut, a simple regularization method that forces the consistency between the output distributions of the original and the cutoff sentence pairs. Without leveraging extra dataset via back-translation or integrating large-scale pretrained model, Bi-SimCut achieves strong translation performance across five translation benchmarks (data sizes range from 160K to 20.2M): BLEU scores of 31.16 for en -> de and 38.37 for de -> en on the IWSLT14 dataset, 30.78 for en -> de and 35.15 for de -> en on the WMT14 dataset, and 27.17 for zh -> en on the WMT17 dataset. SimCut is not a new method, but a version of Cutoff (Shen et al., 2020) simplified and adapted for NMT, and it could be considered as a perturbation-based method. Given the universality and simplicity of SimCut and Bi-SimCut, we believe they can serve as strong baselines for future NMT research. ",

    "abstract": "While large-scale neural language models, such as GPT2 and BART, have achieved impressive results on various text generation tasks, they tend to get stuck in undesirable sentence-level loops with maximization-based decoding algorithms (\\textit{e.g.}, greedy search). This phenomenon is counter-intuitive since there are few consecutive sentence-level repetitions in human corpora (e.g., 0.02\\% in Wikitext-103). To investigate the underlying reasons for generating consecutive sentence-level repetitions, we study the relationship between the probabilities of the repetitive tokens and their previous repetitions in the context. Through our quantitative experiments, we find that 1) Language models have a preference to repeat the previous sentence; 2) The sentence-level repetitions have a \\textit{self-reinforcement effect}: the more times a sentence is repeated in the context, the higher the probability of continuing to generate that sentence; 3) The sentences with higher initial probabilities usually have a stronger self-reinforcement effect. Motivated by our findings, we propose a simple and effective training method \\textbf{DITTO} (Pseu\\underline{D}o-Repet\\underline{IT}ion Penaliza\\underline{T}i\\underline{O}n), where the model learns to penalize probabilities of sentence-level repetitions from pseudo repetitive data. Although our method is motivated by mitigating repetitions, experiments show that DITTO not only mitigates the repetition issue without sacrificing perplexity, but also achieves better generation quality. Extensive experiments on open-ended text generation (Wikitext-103) and text summarization (CNN/DailyMail) demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our method. ",

We propose a novel graph restructuring method to maximize the benefit of prevalent GNNs with the homophilic assumption. Our contribution is threefold: a) learning the weight of pseudo-eigenvectors for an adaptive spectral clustering that aligns well with known node labels, b) proposing a new homophilic metric that measures how two nodes with the same label are likely to be connected, and c) reconstructing the adjacency matrix based on the result of adaptive spectral clustering to maximize the homophilic scores. The experimental results show that our graph restructuring method can significantly boost the performance of six classical GNNs by an average of 25% on less-homophilic graphs.

Inspired by structural entropy on graphs, we transform the data sample from graphs to coding trees, which is a simpler but essential structure for graph data. Furthermore, we propose a novel message passing scheme, termed hierarchical reporting, in which features are transferred from leaf nodes to root nodes by following the hierarchical structure of coding trees. We then present a tree kernel and a convolutional network to implement our scheme for graph classification. With the designed message passing scheme, the tree kernel and convolutional network have a lower runtime complexity of $O(n)$ than Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel and other graph neural networks of at least $O(hm)$. We empirically validate our methods with several graph classification benchmarks and demonstrate that they achieve better performance and lower computational consumption than competing approaches. ",

Existing cropping detection mechanisms analyze the fundamental traces of image cropping, for example, chromatic aberration and vignetting to uncover cropping attack, yet fragile to common post-processing attacks which deceive forensics by removing such cues. Besides, they ignore the fact that recovering the cropped-out contents can unveil the purpose of the behaved cropping attack. This paper presents a novel robust watermarking scheme for image Cropping Localization and Recovery (CLR-Net). We first protect the original image by introducing imperceptible perturbations. Then, typical image post-processing attacks are simulated to erode the protected image. On the recipient's side, we predict the cropping mask and recover the original image. We propose two plug-and-play networks to improve the real-world robustness of CLR-Net, namely, the Fine-Grained generative JPEG simulator (FG-JPEG) and the Siamese image pre-processing network. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the combined challenge of image cropping localization and entire image recovery from a fragment. Experiments demonstrate that CLR-Net can accurately localize the cropping as well as recover the details of the cropped-out regions with both high quality and fidelity, despite of the presence of image processing attacks of varied types.

    "abstract": "While adversarial training and its variants have shown to be the most effective algorithms to defend against adversarial attacks, their extremely slow training process makes it hard to scale to large datasets like ImageNet. The key idea of recent works to accelerate adversarial training is to substitute multi-step attacks (e.g., PGD) with single-step attacks (e.g., FGSM). However, these single-step methods suffer from catastrophic overfitting, where the accuracy against PGD attack suddenly drops to nearly 0% during training, destroying the robustness of the networks. In this work, we study the phenomenon from the perspective of training instances. We show that catastrophic overfitting is instance-dependent and fitting instances with larger gradient norm is more likely to cause catastrophic overfitting. Based on our findings, we propose a simple but effective method, Adversarial Training with Adaptive Step size (ATAS). ATAS learns an instancewise adaptive step size that is inversely proportional to its gradient norm. The theoretical analysis shows that ATAS converges faster than the commonly adopted non-adaptive counterparts. Empirically, ATAS consistently mitigates catastrophic overfitting and achieves higher robust accuracy on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet when evaluated on various adversarial budgets. ",

    "title": "Ego Network Structure in Online Social Networks and its Impact on  Information Diffusion",
    "abstract": "In the last few years, Online Social Networks (OSNs) attracted the interest of a large number of researchers, thanks to their central role in the society. Through the analysis of OSNs, many social phenomena have been studied, such as the viral diffusion of information amongst people. What is still unclear is the relation between micro-level structural properties of OSNs (i.e. the properties of the personal networks of the users, also known as ego networks) and the emergence of such phenomena. A better knowledge of this relation could be essential for the creation of services for the Future Internet, such as highly personalised advertisements fitted on users' needs and characteristics. In this paper, we contribute to bridge this gap by analysing the ego networks of a large sample of Facebook and Twitter users. Our results indicate that micro-level structural properties of OSNs are interestingly similar to those found in social networks formed offline. In particular, online ego networks show the same structure found offline, with social contacts arranged in layers with compatible size and composition. From the analysis of Twitter ego networks, we have been able to find a direct impact of tie strength and ego network circles on the diffusion of information in the network. Specifically, there is a high correlation between the frequency of direct contact between users and her friends in Twitter (a proxy for tie strength), and the frequency of retweets made by the users from tweets generated by their friends. We analysed the correlation for each ego network layer identified in Twitter, discovering their role in the diffusion of information. ",

Spam is any kind of unwanted, unsolicited digital communication that gets sent out in bulk, spam emails and SMSs are causing major resource wastage by unnecessarily flooding the network links. Although most spam mail originate with advertisers looking to push their products, some are much more malicious in their intent like phishing emails that aims to trick victims into giving up sensitive information like website logins or credit card information this type of cybercrime is known as phishing. To countermeasure spams, many researches and efforts are done to build spam detectors that are able to filter out messages and emails as spam or ham. In this research we build a spam detector using BERT pre-trained model that classifies emails and messages by understanding to their context, and we trained our spam detector model using multiple corpuses like SMS collection corpus, Enron corpus, SpamAssassin corpus, Ling-Spam corpus and SMS spam collection corpus, our spam detector performance was 98.62%, 97.83%, 99.13% and 99.28% respectively.

To solve this extremely challenging task, we present a purely data-driven method, which eliminates the prior assumption of lighting by replacing the recovery of physical lighting parameters with the extraction of the generic lighting representation, named global lighting contexts. We use them like lighting parameters in a calibrated photometric stereo network to recover surface normal vectors pixelwisely. To adapt our network to a wide variety of shapes, materials and lightings, it is trained on a new synthetic dataset which simulates the appearance of objects in the wild.

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) recently gained momentum due to their low-power multiplication-free computing and the closer resemblance of biological processes in the nervous system of humans. However, SNNs require very long spike trains (up to 1000) to reach an accuracy similar to their artificial neural network (ANN) counterparts for large models, which offsets efficiency and inhibits its application to low-power systems for real-world use cases. To alleviate this problem, emerging neural encoding schemes are proposed to shorten the spike train while maintaining the high accuracy. However, current accelerators for SNN cannot well support the emerging encoding schemes. In this work, we present a novel hardware architecture that can efficiently support SNN with emerging neural encoding. Our implementation features energy and area efficient processing units with increased parallelism and reduced memory accesses. We verified the accelerator on FPGA and achieve 25% and 90% improvement over previous work in power consumption and latency, respectively. At the same time, high area efficiency allows us to scale for large neural network models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to deploy the large neural network model VGG on physical FPGA-based neuromorphic hardware. ",

However, as in the single-node supervised learning setup, models trained in federated learning suffer from vulnerability to imperceptible input transformations known as adversarial attacks, questioning their deployment in security-related applications. In this work, we study the interplay between federated training, personalization, and certified robustness. In particular, we deploy randomized smoothing, a widely-used and scalable certification method, to certify deep networks trained on a federated setup against input perturbations and transformations. We find that the simple federated averaging technique is effective in building not only more accurate, but also more certifiably-robust models, compared to training solely on local data. We further analyze personalization, a popular technique in federated training that increases the model's bias towards local data, on robustness. We show several advantages of personalization over both~(that is, only training on local data and federated training) in building more robust models with faster training. Finally, we explore the robustness of mixtures of global and local~(\\ie personalized) models, and find that the robustness of local models degrades as they diverge from the global model ",

These contaminations are modeled with the proper statistical distributions depending on the underwater conditions. The optical turbulence modeling link coefficients are shown to be following the Log-normal distribution which its mean and variance are directly dependent on the temperature and the salinity of the simulated water and the assumed distance between the diffusion network nodes. The performance of the diffusion network in using UVLC technology is then analyzed both with simulations and theoretical calculations and the results are presented using the steady-state error metrics. Our analysis showed that the diffusion network can be implemented underwater with the VLC technology providing that the distance between the network nodes is less than 10 meters. Also, in order to guarantee the convergence of the adaptive network, the water salinity level and temperature must not exceed the values that are presented in our simulations. ",

    "abstract": "Electrochemical batteries are ubiquitous devices in our society. When they are employed in mission-critical applications, the ability to precisely predict the end of discharge under highly variable environmental and operating conditions is of paramount importance in order to support operational decision-making. While there are accurate predictive models of the processes underlying the charge and discharge phases of batteries, the modelling of ageing and its effect on performance remains poorly understood. Such a lack of understanding often leads to inaccurate models or the need for time-consuming calibration procedures whenever the battery ages or its conditions change significantly. This represents a major obstacle to the real-world deployment of efficient and robust battery management systems. In this paper, we propose for the first time an approach that can predict the voltage discharge curve for batteries of any degradation level without the need for calibration. In particular, we introduce Dynaformer, a novel Transformer-based deep learning architecture which is able to simultaneously infer the ageing state from a limited number of voltage/current samples and predict the full voltage discharge curve for real batteries with high precision. Our experiments show that the trained model is effective for input current profiles of different complexities and is robust to a wide range of degradation levels. In addition to evaluating the performance of the proposed framework on simulated data, we demonstrate that a minimal amount of fine-tuning allows the model to bridge the simulation-to-real gap between simulations and real data collected from a set of batteries. The proposed methodology enables the utilization of battery-powered systems until the end of discharge in a controlled and predictable way, thereby significantly prolonging the operating cycles and reducing costs.

We posit the detection of conversation groups as a learning problem that could benefit from leveraging the spatial context of the surroundings, and the inherent temporal context in interpersonal dynamics which is reflected in the temporal dynamics in human behavior signals, an aspect that has not been addressed in recent prior works. This motivates our approach which consists of a dynamic LSTM-based deep learning model that predicts continuous pairwise affinity values indicating how likely two people are in the same conversation group. These affinity values are also continuous in time, since relationships and group membership do not occur instantaneously, even though the ground truths of group membership are binary. Using the predicted affinity values, we apply a graph clustering method based on Dominant Set extraction to identify the conversation groups. We benchmark the proposed method against established methods on multiple social interaction datasets. Our results showed that the proposed method improves group detection performance in data that has more temporal granularity in conversation group labels. Additionally, we provide an analysis in the predicted affinity values in relation to the conversation group detection. Finally, we demonstrate the usability of the predicted affinity values in a forecasting framework to predict group membership for a given forecast horizon. ",

    "abstract": "In many inertial confinement fusion experiments, the neutron yield and other parameters cannot be completely accounted for with one and two dimensional models. This discrepancy suggests that there are three dimensional effects which may be significant. Sources of these effects include defects in the shells and shell interfaces, the fill tube of the capsule, and the joint feature in double shell targets. Due to their ability to penetrate materials, X-rays are used to capture the internal structure of objects. Methods such as Computational Tomography use X-ray radiographs from hundreds of projections in order to reconstruct a three dimensional model of the object. In experimental environments, such as the National Ignition Facility and Omega-60, the availability of these views is scarce and in many cases only consist of a single line of sight. Mathematical reconstruction of a 3D object from sparse views is an ill-posed inverse problem. These types of problems are typically solved by utilizing prior information. Neural networks have been used for the task of 3D reconstruction as they are capable of encoding and leveraging this prior information. We utilize half a dozen different convolutional neural networks to produce different 3D representations of ICF implosions from the experimental data. We utilize deep supervision to train a neural network to produce high resolution reconstructions. We use these representations to track 3D features of the capsules such as the ablator, inner shell, and the joint between shell hemispheres. Machine learning, supplemented by different priors, is a promising method for 3D reconstructions in ICF and X-ray radiography in general. ",

By designing contrastive and non-contrastive criteria that can be related algebraically and shown to be equivalent under limited assumptions, we show how close those families can be. We further study popular methods and introduce variations of them, allowing us to relate this theoretical result to current practices and show how design choices in the criterion can influence the optimization process and downstream performance. We also challenge the popular assumptions that contrastive and non-contrastive methods, respectively, need large batch sizes and output dimensions. Our theoretical and quantitative results suggest that the numerical gaps between contrastive and noncontrastive methods in certain regimes can be significantly reduced given better network design choice and hyperparameter tuning.

    "abstract": "The excessive runtime of high-fidelity partial differential equation (PDE) solvers makes them unsuitable for time-critical applications. We propose to accelerate PDE solvers using reduced-order modeling (ROM). Whereas prior ROM approaches reduce the dimensionality of discretized vector fields, our continuous reduced-order modeling (CROM) approach builds a smooth, low-dimensional manifold of the continuous vector fields themselves, not their discretization. We represent this reduced manifold using neural fields, relying on their continuous and differentiable nature to efficiently solve the PDEs. CROM may train on any and all available numerical solutions of the continuous system, even when they are obtained using diverse methods or discretizations. After the low-dimensional manifolds are built, solving PDEs requires significantly less computational resources. Since CROM is discretization-agnostic, CROM-based PDE solvers may optimally adapt discretization resolution over time to economize computation. We validate our approach on an extensive range of PDEs with training data from voxel grids, meshes, and point clouds. Large-scale experiments demonstrate that our approach obtains speed, memory, and accuracy advantages over prior ROM approaches while gaining 109$\\times$ wall-clock speedup over full-order models on CPUs and 89$\\times$ speedup on GPUs.

We further discover that the loss and the privacy loss on an example are well-correlated. This implies groups that are underserved in terms of model utility are simultaneously underserved in terms of privacy loss. For example, on CIFAR-10, the average $\\epsilon$ of the class with the highest loss (Cat) is 32% higher than that of the class with the lowest loss (Ship).

However, previous Attention architecture does not constrain repeated information in the user's historical behavior, which limits the power of hidden representation and leads to some problems such as information redundancy and filter bubbles. To solve this problem, we propose a personalized news recommendation model called DCAN.It captures multi-grained user-news matching signals through news encoders and user encoders. We keep updating a coverage vector to track the history of news attention and augment the vector in 4 types of ways. Then we fed the augmented Coverage vector into the Multi-headed Self-attention model to help adjust the future attention and added the Coverage regulation to the loss function(CRL), which enabled the recommendation system to consider more about differentiated information. Extensive experiments on Microsoft News Recommendation Dataset (MIND) show that our model significantly improve the diversity of news recommendations with minimal sacrifice in accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) and their multi-scale and hierarchical variations have been successful at capturing image representations but their use has been generally studied for low-resolution images (e.g. - 256x256, 384384). For gigapixel whole-slide imaging (WSI) in computational pathology, WSIs can be as large as 150000x150000 pixels at 20X magnification and exhibit a hierarchical structure of visual tokens across varying resolutions: from 16x16 images capture spatial patterns among cells, to 4096x4096 images characterizing interactions within the tissue microenvironment. We introduce a new ViT architecture called the Hierarchical Image Pyramid Transformer (HIPT), which leverages the natural hierarchical structure inherent in WSIs using two levels of self-supervised learning to learn high-resolution image representations. HIPT is pretrained across 33 cancer types using 10,678 gigapixel WSIs, 408,218 4096x4096 images, and 104M 256x256 images. We benchmark HIPT representations on 9 slide-level tasks, and demonstrate that: 1) HIPT with hierarchical pretraining outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for cancer subtyping and survival prediction, 2) self-supervised ViTs are able to model important inductive biases about the hierarchical structure of phenotypes in the tumor microenvironment.

Nearly two years after privacy labels launched, only 60.5% of apps have privacy labels, increasing by an average of 0.5% per week, mostly driven by new apps rather than older apps coming into compliance. Of apps with labels, 17.3% collect data used to track users, 37.6% collect data that is linked to a user identity, and 41.9% collect data that is not linked. Only 42.1% of apps with labels indicate that they do not collect any data.

    "abstract": "We consider transfer learning approaches that fine-tune a pretrained deep neural network on a target task. We investigate generalization properties of fine-tuning to understand the problem of overfitting, which often happens in practice. Previous works have shown that constraining the distance from the initialization of fine-tuning improves generalization. Using a PAC-Bayesian analysis, we observe that besides distance from initialization, Hessians affect generalization through the noise stability of deep neural networks against noise injections. Motivated by the observation, we develop Hessian distance-based generalization bounds for a wide range of fine-tuning methods. Next, we investigate the robustness of fine-tuning with noisy labels. We design an algorithm that incorporates consistent losses and distance-based regularization for fine-tuning. Additionally, we prove a generalization error bound of our algorithm under class conditional independent noise in the training dataset labels. We perform a detailed empirical study of our algorithm on various noisy environments and architectures. For example, on six image classification tasks whose training labels are generated with programmatic labeling, we show a 3.26% accuracy improvement over prior methods. Meanwhile, the Hessian distance measure of the fine-tuned network using our algorithm decreases by six times more than existing approaches. ",

Adopting AI-based techniques and more specifically Deep Learning (DL) approaches to control and guide these UAVs can be beneficial in terms of performance but add more concerns regarding the safety of those techniques and their vulnerability against adversarial attacks causing the chances of collisions going up as the agent becomes confused. This paper proposes an innovative approach based on the explainability of DL methods to build an efficient detector that will protect these DL schemes and thus the UAVs adopting them from potential attacks. The agent is adopting a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) scheme for guidance and planning. It is formed and trained with a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) with Prioritised Experience Replay (PER) DRL scheme that utilises Artificial Potential Field (APF) to improve training times and obstacle avoidance performance. The adversarial attacks are generated by Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Basic Iterative Method (BIM) algorithms and reduced obstacle course completion rates from 80\\% to 35\\%. A Realistic Synthetic environment for UAV explainable DRL based planning and guidance including obstacles and adversarial attacks is built. Two adversarial attack detectors are proposed. The first one adopts a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and achieves an accuracy in detection of 80\\%. The second detector is developed based on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network and achieves an accuracy of 91\\% with much faster computing times when compared to the CNN based detector. ",

In this context, this paper finds inspiration from recent discoveries on cortical circuits in the brain to propose a more biologically plausible self-supervised machine learning approach that combines multimodal information using intra-layer modulations together with canonical correlation analysis (CCA), as well as a memory mechanism to keep track of temporal data, the so-called Canonical Cortical Graph Neural networks. The approach outperformed recent state-of-the-art results considering both better clean audio reconstruction and energy efficiency, described by a reduced and smother neuron firing rate distribution, suggesting the model as a suitable approach for speech enhancement in future audio-visual hearing aid devices.

Often the safety cost is sparse and unknown, which unavoidably leads to constraint violations -- a phenomenon ideally to be avoided in safety-critical applications. We tackle this problem by augmenting the state-space with a safety state, which is nonnegative if and only if the constraint is satisfied. The value of this state also serves as a distance toward constraint violation, while its initial value indicates the available safety budget. This idea allows us to derive policies for scheduling the safety budget during training. We call our approach Simmer (Safe policy IMproveMEnt for RL) to reflect the careful nature of these schedules. We apply this idea to two safe RL problems: RL with constraints imposed on an average cost, and RL with constraints imposed on a cost with probability one. Our experiments suggest that simmering a safe algorithm can improve safety during training for both settings. We further show that Simmer can stabilize training and improve the performance of safe RL with average constraints. ",

Hence, sequential recommender systems have been developed to learn the dynamic user interests from the historical interactions for suggesting items. However, the interaction pattern encoding functions in most existing sequential recommender systems have focused on single type of user-item interactions. In many real-life online platforms, user-item interactive behaviors are often multi-typed (e.g., click, add-to-favorite, purchase) with complex cross-type behavior inter-dependencies. Learning from informative representations of users and items based on their multi-typed interaction data, is of great importance to accurately characterize the time-evolving user preference. In this work, we tackle the dynamic user-item relation learning with the awareness of multi-behavior interactive patterns. Towards this end, we propose a new Temporal Graph Transformer (TGT) recommendation framework to jointly capture dynamic short-term and long-range user-item interactive patterns, by exploring the evolving correlations across different types of behaviors. The new TGT method endows the sequential recommendation architecture to distill dedicated knowledge for type-specific behavior relational context and the implicit behavior dependencies. Experiments on the real-world datasets indicate that our method TGT consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art recommendation methods.

The flip graph is known to have some connectivity properties: (1) the flip graph is connected; (2) connectivity still holds when restricted to triangulations containing some constrained edges between the points; (3) for $P$ in general position of size $n$, the flip graph is $\\lceil \\frac{n}{2} -2 \\rceil$-connected, a recent result of Wagner and Welzl (SODA 2020). We introduce the study of connectivity properties of the flip graph when some edges between points are forbidden. An edge $e$ between two points is a flip cut edge if eliminating triangulations containing $e$ results in a disconnected flip graph. More generally, a set $X$ of edges between points of $P$ is a flip cut set if eliminating all triangulations that contain edges of $X$ results in a disconnected flip graph. The flip cut number of $P$ is the minimum size of a flip cut set. We give a characterization of flip cut edges that leads to an $O(n \\log n)$ time algorithm to test if an edge is a flip cut edge and, with that as preprocessing, an $O(n)$ time algorithm to test if two triangulations are in the same connected component of the flip graph. For a set of $n$ points in convex position (whose flip graph is the 1-skeleton of the associahedron) we prove that the flip cut number is $n-3$. ",

Therefore, the perturbed data are regarded as abnormal data and the classifier provides a decision boundary between the normal data and abnormal data, although the training data do not include any abnormal data.

    "abstract": "Many flagship smartphone cameras now use a dedicated neural image signal processor (ISP) to render noisy raw sensor images to the final processed output. Training nightmode ISP networks relies on large-scale datasets of image pairs with: (1) a noisy raw image captured with a short exposure and a high ISO gain; and (2) a ground truth low-noise raw image captured with a long exposure and low ISO that has been rendered through the ISP. Capturing such image pairs is tedious and time-consuming, requiring careful setup to ensure alignment between the image pairs. In addition, ground truth images are often prone to motion blur due to the long exposure. To address this problem, we propose a method that synthesizes nighttime images from daytime images. Daytime images are easy to capture, exhibit low-noise (even on smartphone cameras) and rarely suffer from motion blur. We outline a processing framework to convert daytime raw images to have the appearance of realistic nighttime raw images with different levels of noise. Our procedure allows us to easily produce aligned noisy and clean nighttime image pairs. We show the effectiveness of our synthesis framework by training neural ISPs for nightmode rendering. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using our synthetic nighttime images together with small amounts of real data (e.g., 5% to 10%) yields performance almost on par with training exclusively on real nighttime images.

Our algorithm is exceeded only by self-supervised methods requiring training data augmentation by geometric distortions. The only prior knowledge in our unsupervised algorithm is implicit in the network architecture. Multiple convolutional \"energy layers\" contain a sum-of-squares nonlinearity, inspired by \"energy models\" of primary visual cortex. Convolutional kernels are learned with a fast minibatch implementation of the K-Subspaces algorithm. High accuracy requires preprocessing with an initial whitening layer, representations that are less sparse during inference than learning, and rescaling for gain control. The hyperparameters of the network architecture are found by supervised meta-learning, which optimizes unsupervised clustering accuracy. We regard such dependence of unsupervised learning on prior knowledge implicit in network architecture as biologically plausible, and analogous to the dependence of brain architecture on evolutionary history.

    "abstract": "Face manipulation techniques develop rapidly and arouse widespread public concerns. Despite that vanilla convolutional neural networks achieve acceptable performance, they suffer from the overfitting issue. To relieve this issue, there is a trend to introduce some erasing-based augmentations. We find that these methods indeed attempt to implicitly induce more consistent representations for different augmentations via assigning the same label for different augmented images. However, due to the lack of explicit regularization, the consistency between different representations is less satisfactory. Therefore, we constrain the consistency of different representations explicitly and propose a simple yet effective framework, COnsistent REpresentation Learning (CORE). Specifically, we first capture the different representations with different augmentations, then regularize the cosine distance of the representations to enhance the consistency. Extensive experiments (in-dataset and cross-dataset) demonstrate that CORE performs favorably against state-of-the-art face forgery detection methods. ",

    "abstract": "Uncertainty quantification is essential for the reliable deployment of machine learning models to high-stakes application domains. Uncertainty quantification is all the more challenging when training distribution and test distribution are different, even the distribution shifts are mild. Despite the ubiquity of distribution shifts in real-world applications, existing uncertainty quantification approaches mainly study the in-distribution setting where the train and test distributions are the same. In this paper, we develop a systematic calibration model to handle distribution shifts by leveraging data from multiple domains. Our proposed method -- multi-domain temperature scaling -- uses the heterogeneity in the domains to improve calibration robustness under distribution shift. Through experiments on three benchmark data sets, we find our proposed method outperforms existing methods as measured on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets. ",

    "abstract": "Recent methods based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have reached high accuracy for medical image analysis, including the three basic tasks: segmentation, landmark detection, and object detection. It is known that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and the adversarial robustness of DNNs could be improved by adding adversarial noises to training data (i.e., adversarial training). In this study, we show that the standard adversarial training (SAT) method has a severe issue that limits its practical use: it generates a fixed level of noise for DNN training, and it is difficult for the user to choose an appropriate noise level, because a high noise level may lead to a large reduction in model performance, and a low noise level may have little effect. To resolve this issue, we have designed a novel adaptive-margin adversarial training (AMAT) method that generates adaptive adversarial noises for DNN training, which are dynamically tailored for each individual training sample. We have applied our AMAT method to state-of-the-art DNNs for the three basic tasks, using five publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our AMAT method outperforms the SAT method in adversarial robustness on noisy data and prediction accuracy on clean data.

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable segmentation accuracy on benchmark datasets where training and test sets are from the same domain, yet their performance can degrade significantly on unseen domains, which hinders the deployment of CNNs in many clinical scenarios. Most existing works improve model out-of-domain (OOD) robustness by collecting multi-domain datasets for training, which is expensive and may not always be feasible due to privacy and logistical issues. In this work, we focus on improving model robustness using a single-domain dataset only. We propose a novel data augmentation framework called MaxStyle, which maximizes the effectiveness of style augmentation for model OOD performance. It attaches an auxiliary style-augmented image decoder to a segmentation network for robust feature learning and data augmentation. Importantly, MaxStyle augments data with improved image style diversity and hardness, by expanding the style space with noise and searching for the worst-case style composition of latent features via adversarial training. With extensive experiments on multiple public cardiac and prostate MR datasets, we demonstrate that MaxStyle leads to significantly improved out-of-distribution robustness against unseen corruptions as well as common distribution shifts across multiple, different, unseen sites and unknown image sequences under both low- and high-training data settings.

Most of the dehazing methods try to estimate the transmission map along with the atmospheric light to get the dehazed image in the image domain. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end architecture that directly estimates dehazed image in Krawtchouk transform domain. For this a customized Krawtchouk Convolution Layer (KCL) in the architecture is added. KCL is constructed using Krawtchouk basis functions which converts the image from the spatial domain to the Krawtchouk transform domain. Another convolution layer is added at the end of the architecture named as Inverse Krawtchouk Convolution Layer (IKCL) which converts the image back to the spatial domain from the transform domain. It has been observed that the haze is mainly present in lower frequencies of hazy images, wherein the Krawtchouk transform helps to analyze the high and low frequencies of the images separately. We have divided our architecture into two branches, the upper branch deals with the higher frequencies while the lower branch deals with the lower frequencies of the image. The lower branch is made deeper in terms of the layers as compared to the upper branch to address the haze present in the lower frequencies. Using the proposed Orthogonal Transform based Generative Adversarial Network (OTGAN) architecture for image dehazing, we were able to achieve competitive results when compared to the present state-of-the-art methods.

Using this result, we prove that the class of planar graphs has underlying treewidth 3; the class of $K_{s,t}$-minor-free graphs has underlying treewidth $s$ (for ${t \\geq \\max\\{s,3\\}}$); and the class of $K_t$-minor-free graphs has underlying treewidth ${t-2}$. In general, we prove that a monotone class has bounded underlying treewidth if and only if it excludes some fixed topological minor. We also study the underlying treewidth of graph classes defined by an excluded subgraph or excluded induced subgraph. We show that the class of graphs with no $H$ subgraph has bounded underlying treewidth if and only if every component of $H$ is a subdivided star, and that the class of graphs with no induced $H$ subgraph has bounded underlying treewidth if and only if every component of $H$ is a star.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) over resource-constrained wireless networks has recently attracted much attention. However, most existing studies consider one FL task in single-cell wireless networks and ignore the impact of downlink/uplink inter-cell interference on the learning performance. In this paper, we investigate FL over a multi-cell wireless network, where each cell performs a different FL task and over-the-air computation (AirComp) is adopted to enable fast uplink gradient aggregation. We conduct convergence analysis of AirComp-assisted FL systems, taking into account the inter-cell interference in both the downlink and uplink model/gradient transmissions, which reveals that the distorted model/gradient exchanges induce a gap to hinder the convergence of FL. We characterize the Pareto boundary of the error-induced gap region to quantify the learning performance trade-off among different FL tasks, based on which we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the sum of error-induced gaps in all cells. To tackle the coupling between the downlink and uplink transmissions as well as the coupling among multiple cells, we propose a cooperative multi-cell FL optimization framework to achieve efficient interference management for downlink and uplink transmission design. Results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves much better average learning performance over multiple cells than non-cooperative baseline schemes. ",

    "abstract": "A method to perform offline and online speaker diarization for an unlimited number of speakers is described in this paper. End-to-end neural diarization (EEND) has achieved overlap-aware speaker diarization by formulating it as a multi-label classification problem. It has also been extended for a flexible number of speakers by introducing speaker-wise attractors. However, the output number of speakers of attractor-based EEND is empirically capped; it cannot deal with cases where the number of speakers appearing during inference is higher than that during training because its speaker counting is trained in a fully supervised manner. Our method, EEND-GLA, solves this problem by introducing unsupervised clustering into attractor-based EEND. In the method, the input audio is first divided into short blocks, then attractor-based diarization is performed for each block, and finally the results of each blocks are clustered on the basis of the similarity between locally-calculated attractors. While the number of output speakers is limited within each block, the total number of speakers estimated for the entire input can be higher than the limitation. To use EEND-GLA in an online manner, our method also extends the speaker-tracing buffer, which was originally proposed to enable online inference of conventional EEND. We introduces a block-wise buffer update to make the speaker-tracing buffer compatible with EEND-GLA. Finally, to improve online diarization, our method improves the buffer update method and revisits the variable chunk-size training of EEND. The experimental results demonstrate that EEND-GLA can perform speaker diarization of an unseen number of speakers in both offline and online inferences. ",

    "abstract": "Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) promise improved generalization under covariate shift by providing principled probabilistic representations of epistemic uncertainty. However, weight-based BNNs often struggle with high computational complexity of large-scale architectures and datasets. Node-based BNNs have recently been introduced as scalable alternatives, which induce epistemic uncertainty by multiplying each hidden node with latent random variables, while learning a point-estimate of the weights. In this paper, we interpret these latent noise variables as implicit representations of simple and domain-agnostic data perturbations during training, producing BNNs that perform well under covariate shift due to input corruptions. We observe that the diversity of the implicit corruptions depends on the entropy of the latent variables, and propose a straightforward approach to increase the entropy of these variables during training. We evaluate the method on out-of-distribution image classification benchmarks, and show improved uncertainty estimation of node-based BNNs under covariate shift due to input perturbations. As a side effect, the method also provides robustness against noisy training labels. ",

    "abstract": "Sellers in online markets face the challenge of determining the right time to sell in view of uncertain future offers. Classical stopping theory assumes that sellers have full knowledge of the value distributions, and leverage this knowledge to determine stopping rules that maximize expected welfare. In practice, however, stopping rules must often be determined under partial information, based on scarce data or expert predictions. Consider a seller that has one item for sale and receives successive offers drawn from some value distributions. The decision on whether or not to accept an offer is irrevocable, and the value distributions are only partially known. We therefore let the seller adopt a robust maximin strategy, assuming that value distributions are chosen adversarially by nature to minimize the value of the accepted offer. We provide a general maximin solution to this stopping problem that identifies the optimal (threshold-based) stopping rule for the seller for all statistical information structures. We then perform a detailed analysis for when the seller knows the common mean, dispersion (variance or mean absolute deviation) and support of the distributions. We show for this information structure that the seller's stopping rule consists of decreasing thresholds converging to the common mean, and that nature's adversarial response, in the long run, is to always create an all-or-nothing scenario. The maximin solutions also reveal what happens as dispersion or the number of offers grows large. ",

Transitional networks are formed from time series data and they leverage graph theory tools to reveal information about the underlying dynamic system. However, traditional tools can fail to summarize the complex topology present in such graphs. In this work, we leverage persistent homology from topological data analysis to study the structure of these networks. We contrast dynamic state detection from time series using CGSSN and TDA to two state of the art approaches: Ordinal Partition Networks (OPNs) combined with TDA, and the standard application of persistent homology to the time-delay embedding of the signal. We show that the CGSSN captures rich information about the dynamic state of the underlying dynamical system as evidenced by a significant improvement in dynamic state detection and noise robustness in comparison to OPNs. We also show that because the computational time of CGSSN is not linearly dependent on the signal's length, it is more computationally efficient than applying TDA to the time-delay embedding of the time series.

The crossover function enables to calculate the crossover distance for an OWSN and an OFTN. If the distance between two points on Earth is greater than the crossover distance, then switching or crossing over from the OFTN to the OWSN results in lower latency for data communications between these points. In this work, we extend the previously proposed crossover function for a scenario such that intermediate satellites (or hops) are incorporated between ingress and egress satellites in the OWSN for a more realistic calculation of the crossover distance in this scenario. We consider different OWSNs with different satellite altitudes and different OFTNs with different optical fiber refractive indexes, and we study the effect of the number of hops on crossover distance and length of a laser inter-satellite link (LISL). It is observed from numerical results that crossover distance increases with number of hops, and this increase is higher at higher satellite altitudes in OWSNs and lower refractive indexes in OFTNs. Furthermore, an inverse relationship between crossover distance and length of a LISL is observed. With increase in number of hops, the length of a LISL decreases as opposed to the crossover distance.

    "abstract": "The logit outputs of a feedforward neural network at initialization are conditionally Gaussian, given a random covariance matrix defined by the penultimate layer. In this work, we study the distribution of this random matrix. Recent work has shown that shaping the activation function as network depth grows large is necessary for this covariance matrix to be non-degenerate. However, the current infinite-width-style understanding of this shaping method is unsatisfactory for large depth: infinite-width analyses ignore the microscopic fluctuations from layer to layer, but these fluctuations accumulate over many layers. To overcome this shortcoming, we study the random covariance matrix in the shaped infinite-depth-and-width limit. We identify the precise scaling of the activation function necessary to arrive at a non-trivial limit, and show that the random covariance matrix is governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that we call the Neural Covariance SDE. Using simulations, we show that the SDE closely matches the distribution of the random covariance matrix of finite networks. Additionally, we recover an if-and-only-if condition for exploding and vanishing norms of large shaped networks based on the activation function. ",
