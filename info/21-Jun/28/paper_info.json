Each molecule is represented as a complete graph in which each atom is a vertex and all vertex pairs are connected by an edge weighted by the Euclidean distance between atom pairs. We ingest a sequence of complete molecular graphs into a dynamic graph neural network (GNN) to predict the graph at the next time step. Our dynamic GNN predicts atom-to-atom distances with a mean absolute error of 0.017 \\r{A}, which is considered ``chemically accurate'' for molecular simulations. We also explored the transferability of a trained network to new molecular systems and found that finetuning with less than 10% of the total trajectory provides a mean absolute error of the same order of magnitude as that when training from scratch on the full molecular trajectory.

    "abstract": "Smart Contracts (SCs) in Ethereum can automate tasks and provide different functionalities to a user. Such automation is enabled by the `Turing-complete' nature of the programming language (Solidity) in which SCs are written. This also opens up different vulnerabilities and bugs in SCs that malicious actors exploit to carry out malicious or illegal activities on the cryptocurrency platform. In this work, we study the correlation between malicious activities and the vulnerabilities present in SCs and find that some malicious activities are correlated with certain types of vulnerabilities. We then develop and study the feasibility of a scoring mechanism that corresponds to the severity of the vulnerabilities present in SCs to determine if it is a relevant feature to identify suspicious SCs. We analyze the utility of severity score towards detection of suspicious SCs using unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms across different temporal granularities and identify behavioral changes. In our experiments with on-chain SCs, we were able to find a total of 1094 benign SCs across different granularities which behave similar to malicious SCs, with the inclusion of the smart contract vulnerability scores in the feature set.

In this work, we are particularly interested in the estimation of flexible activation functions using tensor-based solutions, where the AFs are expressed as a weighted sum of predefined basis functions. To do so, we propose a new learning algorithm which solves a constrained coupled matrix-tensor factorization (CMTF) problem. This technique fuses the first and zeroth order information of the NN, where the first-order information is contained in a Jacobian tensor, following a constrained canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD). The proposed algorithm can handle different decomposition bases. The goal of this method is to compress large pretrained NN models, by replacing subnetworks, {\\em i.e.,} one or multiple layers of the original network, by a new flexible layer. The approach is applied to a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) used for character classification. ",

    "abstract": "The detection of nuclei and cells in histology images is of great value in both clinical practice and pathological studies. However, multiple reasons such as morphological variations of nuclei or cells make it a challenging task where conventional object detection methods cannot obtain satisfactory performance in many cases. A detection task consists of two sub-tasks, classification and localization. Under the condition of dense object detection, classification is a key to boost the detection performance. Considering this, we propose similarity based region proposal networks (SRPN) for nuclei and cells detection in histology images. In particular, a customized convolution layer termed as embedding layer is designed for network building. The embedding layer is added into the region proposal networks, enabling the networks to learn discriminative features based on similarity learning. Features obtained by similarity learning can significantly boost the classification performance compared to conventional methods. SRPN can be easily integrated into standard convolutional neural networks architectures such as the Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet. We test the proposed approach on tasks of multi-organ nuclei detection and signet ring cells detection in histological images. Experimental results show that networks applying similarity learning achieved superior performance on both tasks when compared to their counterparts. In particular, the proposed SRPN achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MoNuSeg benchmark for nuclei segmentation and detection while compared to previous methods, and on the signet ring cell detection benchmark when compared with baselines.

Due to the computational cost, inflated ciphertext size and limited arithmetic operations that are allowed in most encryption schemes, feasible applications of homomorphic encryption are few. While theorists are working on the mathematical and cryptographical foundations of homomorphic encryption in order to overcome the current limitations, practitioners are also re-designing queries and algorithms to adapt the functionalities of the current encryption schemes. As an initial study on working with homomorphically encrypted graphs, this paper provides an easy-to-implement interactive algorithm to check whether or not a homomorphically encrypted graph is chordal. This algorithm is simply a refactoring of a current method to run on the encrypted adjacency matrices. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a mechanistic data-driven approach is proposed to accelerate structural topology optimization, employing an in-house developed finite element convolutional neural network (FE-CNN). Our approach can be divided into two stages: offline training, and online optimization. During offline training, a mapping function is built between high and low resolution representations of a given design domain. The mapping is expressed by a FE-CNN, which targets a common objective function value (e.g., structural compliance) across design domains of differing resolutions. During online optimization, an arbitrary design domain of high resolution is reduced to low resolution through the trained mapping function. The original high-resolution domain is thus designed by computations performed on only the low-resolution version, followed by an inverse mapping back to the high-resolution domain. Numerical examples demonstrate that this approach can accelerate optimization by up to an order of magnitude in computational time. Our proposed approach therefore shows great potential to overcome the curse-of-dimensionality incurred by density-based structural topology optimization. The limitation of our present approach is also discussed. ",

    "abstract": "Social animals, including humans, have a broad range of personality traits, which can be used to predict individual behavioral responses and decisions. Current methods to quantify individual personality traits in humans rely on self-report questionnaires, which require time and effort to collect and rely on active cooperation. However, personality differences naturally manifest in social interactions such as online social networks. Here, we demonstrate that the topology of an online social network can be used to characterize the personality traits of its members. We analyzed the directed social graph formed by the users of the LiveJournal (LJ) blogging platform. Individual users personality traits, inferred from their self-reported domains of interest (DOIs), were associated with their network measures. Empirical clustering of DOIs by topological similarity exposed two main self-emergent DOI groups that were in alignment with the personality meta-traits plasticity and stability. Closeness, a global topological measure of network centrality, was significantly higher for bloggers associated with plasticity (vs. stability). A local network motif (a triad of 3 connected bloggers) that correlated with closeness also separated the personality meta-traits. Finally, topology-based classification of DOIs (without analyzing the content of the blogs) attained > 70% accuracy (average AUC of the test-set). These results indicate that personality traits are evident and detectable in network topology. This has serious implications for user privacy. But, if used responsibly, network identification of personality traits could aid in early identification of health-related risks, at the population level. ",

    "abstract": "Temporally and spatially dependent uncertain parameters are regularly encountered in engineering applications. Commonly these uncertainties are accounted for using random fields and processes which require knowledge about the appearing probability distributions functions which is not readily available. In these cases non-probabilistic approaches such as interval analysis and fuzzy set theory are helpful uncertainty measures. Partial differential equations involving fuzzy and interval fields are traditionally solved using the finite element method where the input fields are sampled using some basis function expansion methods. This approach however is problematic, as it is reliant on knowledge about the spatial correlation fields. In this work we utilize physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve interval and fuzzy partial differential equations. The resulting network structures termed interval physics-informed neural networks (iPINNs) and fuzzy physics-informed neural networks (fPINNs) show promising results for obtaining bounded solutions of equations involving spatially uncertain parameter fields. In contrast to finite element approaches, no correlation length specification of the input fields as well as no averaging via Monte-Carlo simulations are necessary. In fact, information about the input interval fields is obtained directly as a byproduct of the presented solution scheme. Furthermore, all major advantages of PINNs are retained, i.e. meshfree nature of the scheme, and ease of inverse problem set-up. ",

On the other hand, it was shown by previous studies that generated optimized molecules are often unrealistic, even with the inclusion of mechanics to enforce similarity to a dataset of real drug molecules. In this work we use a hybrid approach, where the dataset distribution is learned using an autoregressive model while the score optimization is done using the Metropolis algorithm, biased toward the learned distribution. We show that the resulting method, that we call learned realism sampling (LRS), produces empirically more realistic molecules and outperforms all recent baselines in the task of molecule optimization with similarity constraints.

The basic idea is to apply the proximal majorization-minimization algorithm to solve the nonconvex problem with the inner subproblems solved by a sparse semismooth Newton (SSN) method based proximal point algorithm (PPA). We must emphasize that the main difficulty in the design of the algorithm lies in how to overcome the singular difficulty of the inner subproblem. Furthermore, we also prove that the PPMM algorithm converges to a d-stationary point. Due to the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property of the problem, we present the convergence rate of the PPMM algorithm.
