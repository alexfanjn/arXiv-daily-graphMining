    "abstract": "We conjecture that the relative unpopularity of logical frameworks among practitioners is partly due to their complex meta-languages, which often demand both programming skills and theoretical knowledge of the meta-language in question for them to be fruitfully used. We present ongoing work on a logical framework with a meta-language based on graphs. A simpler meta-language leads to a shallower embedding of the object language, but hopefully leads to easier implementation and usage. A graph-based logical framework also opens up interesting possibilities in time and space performance by using heavily optimized graph databases as backends and by proof compression algorithms geared towards graphs. Deductive systems can be specified using simple domain-specific languages built on top of the graph database's query language. There is support for interactive (through a web-based interface) and semiautomatic (following user-defined tactics specified by a domain-specific language) proof modes. We have so far implemented nine systems for propositional logic, including Fitch-style and backward-directed Natural Deduction systems for intuitionistic and classical logic (with the classical systems reusing the rules of the intuitionistic ones), and a Hilbert-style system for the K modal logic.

    "abstract": "Web search engines influence perception of social reality by filtering and ranking information. However, their outputs are often subjected to bias that can lead to skewed representation of subjects such as professional occupations or gender. In our paper, we use a mixed-method approach to investigate presence of race and gender bias in representation of artificial intelligence (AI) in image search results coming from six different search engines. Our findings show that search engines prioritize anthropomorphic images of AI that portray it as white, whereas non-white images of AI are present only in non-Western search engines. By contrast, gender representation of AI is more diverse and less skewed towards a specific gender that can be attributed to higher awareness about gender bias in search outputs. Our observations indicate both the the need and the possibility for addressing bias in representation of societally relevant subjects, such as technological innovation, and emphasize the importance of designing new approaches for detecting bias in information retrieval systems.

In this manuscript we perform analysis of a corresponding algorithm and show that the parameters of the RNs of the well trained predictive network are not independent of each other. Their dependence can be used to significantly improve the network effectiveness. The traditional seq2seq algorithms require short term memory of a size proportional to the predicted sequence length. This requirement is quite difficult to implement in a neuroscience context. We present a novel memoryless algorithm for seq2seq predictive networks and compare it to the traditional one in the context of time series prediction. We show that the new algorithm is more robust and makes predictions with higher accuracy than the traditional one. ",

    "abstract": "Content-independent watermarks and block-wise independency can be considered as vulnerabilities in semi-fragile watermarking methods. In this paper to achieve the objectives of semi-fragile watermarking techniques, a method is proposed to not have the mentioned shortcomings. In the proposed method, the watermark is generated by relying on image content and a key. Furthermore, the embedding scheme causes the watermarked blocks to become dependent on each other, using a key. In the embedding phase, the image is partitioned into non-overlapping blocks. In order to detect and separate the different types of attacks more precisely, the proposed method embeds three copies of each watermark bit into LWT coefficients of each 4x4 block. In the authentication phase, by voting between the extracted bits the error maps are created; these maps indicate image authenticity and reveal the modified regions. Also, in order to automate the authentication, the images are classified into four categories using seven features. Classification accuracy in the experiments is 97.97 percent. It is noted that our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is robust against JPEG compression and is competitive with a state-of-the-art semi-fragile watermarking method, in terms of robustness and semi-fragility.

    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet-50, DenseNet-40 and ResNeXt-56 are severely over-parameterized, necessitating a consequent increase in the computational resources required for model training which scales exponentially for increments in model depth. In this paper, we propose an Entropy-Based Convolutional Layer Estimation (EBCLE) heuristic which is robust and simple, yet effective in resolving the problem of over-parameterization with regards to network depth of CNN model. The EBCLE heuristic employs a priori knowledge of the entropic data distribution of input datasets to determine an upper bound for convolutional network depth, beyond which identity transformations are prevalent offering insignificant contributions for enhancing model performance. Restricting depth redundancies by forcing feature compression and abstraction restricts over-parameterization while decreasing training time by 24.99% - 78.59% without degradation in model performance. We present empirical evidence to emphasize the relative effectiveness of broader, yet shallower models trained using the EBCLE heuristic, which maintains or outperforms baseline classification accuracies of narrower yet deeper models. The EBCLE heuristic is architecturally agnostic and EBCLE based CNN models restrict depth redundancies resulting in enhanced utilization of the available computational resources. The proposed EBCLE heuristic is a compelling technique for researchers to analytically justify their HyperParameter (HP) choices for CNNs. Empirical validation of the EBCLE heuristic in training CNN models was established on five benchmarking datasets (ImageNet32, CIFAR-10/100, STL-10, MNIST) and four network architectures (DenseNet, ResNet, ResNeXt and EfficientNet B0-B2) with appropriate statistical tests employed to infer any conclusive claims presented in this paper.

The method is very popular, because its implementation is very easy and does not require the knowledge of a fundamental solution. However, for anisotropic media the method may yield an unphysical radiation condition and lead to erroneous and unstable results. In this article we argue that a radial scaling (opposed to a cartesian scaling) does not suffer from this drawback and produces the desired radiation condition. This result is of great importance as it rehabilitates the application of the complex scaling method for anisotropic media. To present further details we consider the radial complex scaling method for scalar anisotropic resonance problems. We prove that the associated operator is Fredholm and show the convergence of approximations generated by simulateneous domain truncation and finite element discretization. We present computational studies to undergird our theoretical results. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper the problem of scheduling of jobs on parallel machines under incompatibility relation is considered. In this model a binary relation between jobs is given and no two jobs that are in the relation can be scheduled on the same machine. In particular, we consider job scheduling under incompatibility relation forming bipartite graphs, under makespan optimality criterion, on uniform and unrelated machines. We show that no algorithm can achieve a good approximation ratio for uniform machines, even for a case of unit time jobs, under $P \\neq NP$. We also provide an approximation algorithm that achieves the best possible approximation ratio, even for the case of jobs of arbitrary lengths $p_j$, under the same assumption. Precisely, we present an $O(n^{1/2-\\epsilon})$ inapproximability bound, for any $\\epsilon > 0$; and $\\sqrt{p_{sum}}$-approximation algorithm, respectively. To enrich the analysis, bipartite graphs generated randomly according to Gilbert's model $\\mathcal{G}_{n,n,p(n)}$ are considered. For a broad class of $p(n)$ functions we show that there exists an algorithm producing a schedule with makespan almost surely at most twice the optimum. Due to our knowledge, this is the first study of randomly generated graphs in the context of scheduling in the considered model. For unrelated machines, an FPTAS for $R2|G = bipartite|C_{\\max}$ is provided. We also show that there is no algorithm of approximation ratio $O(n^bp_{\\max}^{1-\\epsilon})$, even for $Rm|G = bipartite|C_{max}$ for $m \\ge 3$ and any $\\epsilon > 0$, $b > 0$, unless $P = NP$.

    "abstract": "There is an escalating need for methods to identify latent patterns in text data from many domains. We introduce a new method to identify topics in a corpus and represent documents as topic sequences. Discourse Atom Topic Modeling draws on advances in theoretical machine learning to integrate topic modeling and word embedding, capitalizing on the distinct capabilities of each. We first identify a set of vectors (\"discourse atoms\") that provide a sparse representation of an embedding space. Atom vectors can be interpreted as latent topics: Through a generative model, atoms map onto distributions over words; one can also infer the topic that generated a sequence of words. We illustrate our method with a prominent example of underutilized text: the U.S. National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). The NVDRS summarizes violent death incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify 225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured variables. Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide by gender, and recent research on gender biases in semantic space, we identify the gender bias of our topics (e.g., a topic about pain medication is feminine). We then compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female versus male victims. Results provide a detailed quantitative picture of reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a flexible and broadly applicable approach to model topics in text data.

We construct neural networks, whose PINN residual (generalization error) can be made as small as desired. We also prove that the total $L^2$-error can be bounded by the generalization error, which in turn is bounded in terms of the training error, provided that a sufficient number of randomly chosen training (collocation) points is used. Moreover, we prove that the size of the PINNs and the number of training samples only grow polynomially with the underlying dimension, enabling PINNs to overcome the curse of dimensionality in this context. These results enable us to provide a comprehensive error analysis for PINNs in approximating Kolmogorov PDEs. ",

It is unknown which of those errors are associated significantly with low quality judgements by humans who the text is aimed for, which hampers addressing errors based on their impact on improving human evaluations. We assessed their possible association with an experiment availing of expert and crowdsourced evaluations of human authored text, template generated text, and sequence-to-sequence model generated text. The results showed that there was no significant association between human authored texts with errors and the low human judgements of naturalness and quality. There was also no significant association between machine learning generated texts with dropped or hallucinated slots and the low human judgements of naturalness and quality. Thus, both approaches appear to be viable options for designing a natural language interface for knowledge graphs. ",

To address this gap, we extend the idea behind the Bayesian estimate of the map equation for unweighted and undirected networks to enable more robust community detection in weighted and directed networks.

The hybrid zonotope is shown to be equivalent to $2^N$ constrained zonotopes through the addition of $N$ binary zonotope factors and is well-suited for the analysis of hybrid systems with both continuous and discrete states and inputs. The major contribution of this manuscript is a closed-form solution for exact forward reachable sets of linear mixed logical dynamical systems. This is given by a simple identity and does not require solving any optimization programs or taking set approximations. The proposed approach captures the worst-case exponential growth in the number of convex sets required to represent the nonconvex reachable set of a hybrid system while exhibiting only linear growth in the complexity of the hybrid zonotope set representation. To reduce both set representation complexity and the computational burden of reachability analysis, a binary tree is used to store only the combinations of binary factors of the hybrid zonotope that map to nonempty convex sets. The proposed approach is applied to an established benchmark example where the exact reachable set of a discrete-time hybrid system with six continuous and two discrete states is given by a single hybrid zonotope equivalent to the union of 657 constrained zonotopes, and is represented using only 283 continuous factors, 29 binary factors, and 177 linear equality constraints. Furthermore, the hybrid zonotope is closed under linear mappings, Minkowski sums, generalized intersections, and halfspace intersections. ",

    "abstract": "Lyme disease is one of the most common infectious vector-borne diseases in the world. In the early stage, the disease manifests itself in most cases with erythema migrans (EM) skin lesions. Better diagnosis of these early forms would allow improving the prognosis by preventing the transition to a severe late form thanks to appropriate antibiotic therapy. Recent studies show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform very well to identify skin lesions from the image but, there is not much work for Lyme disease prediction from EM lesion images. The main objective of this study is to extensively analyze the effectiveness of CNNs for diagnosing Lyme disease from images and to find out the best CNN architecture for the purpose. There is no publicly available EM image dataset for Lyme disease prediction mainly because of privacy concerns. In this study, we utilized an EM dataset consisting of images collected from Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital Center (CF-CHU) of France and the internet. CF-CHU collected the images from several hospitals in France. This dataset was labeled by expert dermatologists and infectiologists from CF-CHU. First, we benchmarked this dataset for twenty-three well-known CNN architectures in terms of predictive performance metrics, computational complexity metrics, and statistical significance tests. Second, to improve the performance of the CNNs, we used transfer learning from ImageNet pre-trained models as well as pre-trained the CNNs with the skin lesion dataset \"Human Against Machine with 10000 training images (HAM1000)\". In that process, we searched for the best performing number of layers to unfreeze during transfer learning fine-tuning for each of the CNNs. Third, for model explainability, we utilized Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping to visualize the regions of input that are significant to the CNNs for making predictions. Fourth, we provided guidelines for model selection based on predictive performance and computational complexity. Our study confirmed the effectiveness and potential of even some lightweight CNNs to be used for Lyme disease pre-scanner mobile applications. We also made all the trained models publicly available at https://dappem.limos.fr/download.html, which can be used by others for transfer learning and building pre-scanners for Lyme disease. ",

Using input convex neural networks, the models are hyperelastic, anisotropic and fulfill the polyconvexity condition, which implies ellipticity and thus ensures material stability. The first constitutive model is based on a set of polyconvex, anisotropic and objective invariants. The second approach is formulated in terms of the deformation gradient, its cofactor and determinant, uses group symmetrization to fulfill the material symmetry condition, and data augmentation to fulfill objectivity approximately. The extension of the dataset for the data augmentation approach is based on mechanical considerations and does not require additional experimental or simulation data. The models are calibrated with highly challenging simulation data of cubic lattice metamaterials, including finite deformations and lattice instabilities. A moderate amount of calibration data is used, based on deformations which are commonly applied in experimental investigations. While the invariant-based model shows drawbacks for several deformation modes, the model based on the deformation gradient alone is able to reproduce and predict the effective material behavior very well and exhibits excellent generalization capabilities. Thus, in particular the second model presents a highly flexible constitutive modeling approach, that leads to a mathematically well-posed problem. ",
