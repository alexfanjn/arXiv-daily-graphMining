    "abstract": "The optimal way for a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to explore is to learn a set of skills that achieves a uniform distribution of states. Following this,we introduce DisTop, a new model that simultaneously learns diverse skills and focuses on improving rewarding skills. DisTop progressively builds a discrete topology of the environment using an unsupervised contrastive loss, a growing network and a goal-conditioned policy. Using this topology, a state-independent hierarchical policy can select where the agent has to keep discovering skills in the state space. In turn, the newly visited states allows an improved learnt representation and the learning loop continues. Our experiments emphasize that DisTop is agnostic to the ground state representation and that the agent can discover the topology of its environment whether the states are high-dimensional binary data, images, or proprioceptive inputs. We demonstrate that this paradigm is competitiveon MuJoCo benchmarks with state-of-the-art algorithms on both single-task dense rewards and diverse skill discovery. By combining these two aspects, we showthat DisTop achieves state-of-the-art performance in comparison with hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) when rewards are sparse. We believe DisTop opens new perspectives by showing that bottom-up skill discovery combined with representation learning can unlock the exploration challenge in DRL. ",

    "abstract": "Users online tend to consume information adhering to their system of beliefs and to ignore dissenting information. During the COVID-19 pandemic, users get exposed to a massive amount of information about a new topic having a high level of uncertainty. In this paper, we analyze two social media that enforced opposite moderation methods, Twitter and Gab, to assess the interplay between news consumption and content regulation concerning COVID-19. We compare the two platforms on about three million pieces of content analyzing user interaction with respect to news articles. We first describe users' consumption patterns on the two platforms focusing on the political leaning of news outlets. Finally, we characterize the echo chamber effect by modeling the dynamics of users' interaction networks. Our results show that the presence of moderation pursued by Twitter produces a significant reduction of questionable content, with a consequent affiliation towards reliable sources in terms of engagement and comments. Conversely, the lack of clear regulation on Gab results in the tendency of the user to engage with both types of content, showing a slight preference for the questionable ones which may account for a dissing/endorsement behavior. Twitter users show segregation towards reliable content with a uniform narrative. Gab, instead, offers a more heterogeneous structure where users, independently of their leaning, follow people who are slightly polarized towards questionable news. ",

    "abstract": "Building invariance to non-meaningful transformations is essential to building efficient and generalizable machine learning models. In practice, the most common way to learn invariance is through data augmentation. There has been recent interest in the development of methods that learn distributions on augmentation transformations from the training data itself. While such approaches are beneficial since they are responsive to the data, they ignore the fact that in many situations the range of transformations to which a model needs to be invariant changes depending on the particular class input belongs to. For example, if a model needs to be able to predict whether an image contains a starfish or a dog, we may want to apply random rotations to starfish images during training (since these do not have a preferred orientation), but we would not want to do this to images of dogs. In this work we introduce a method by which we can learn class conditional distributions on augmentation transformations. We give a number of examples where our methods learn different non-meaningful transformations depending on class and further show how our method can be used as a tool to probe the symmetries intrinsic to a potentially complex dataset.

While the complexity of exact counting of graph homomorphisms (Dyer and Greenhill, 2000) and the counting CSP (Bulatov, 2013, and Dyer and Richerby, 2013) is well understood, counting modulo some natural number has attracted considerable interest as well. In their 2015 paper Faben and Jerrum suggested a conjecture stating that counting homomorphisms to a fixed graph H modulo a prime number is hard whenever it is hard to count exactly, unless H has automorphisms of certain kind. In this paper we confirm this conjecture. As a part of this investigation we develop techniques that widen the spectrum of reductions available for modular counting and apply to the general CSP rather than being limited to graph homomorphisms.

Specifically, we first propose a loss-shifting trick in the $\\text{FTRL}$ analysis, which greatly simplifies the approach of [Jin and Luo, 2020] and already improves their results for the known transition case. Then, we extend this idea to the unknown transition case and develop a novel analysis which upper bounds the transition estimation error by (a fraction of) the regret itself in the stochastic setting, a key property to ensure $\\mathcal{O}(\\text{polylog}(T))$ regret.

    "abstract": "This work explores the hypothesis that the complexity of the function a deep neural network (NN) is learning can be deduced by how fast its weights change during training. Our analysis provides evidence for this supposition by relating the network's distribution of Lipschitz constants (i.e., the norm of the gradient at different regions of the input space) during different training intervals with the behavior of the stochastic training procedure. We first observe that the average Lipschitz constant close to the training data affects various aspects of the parameter trajectory, with more complex networks having a longer trajectory, bigger variance, and often veering further from their initialization. We then show that NNs whose biases are trained more steadily have bounded complexity even in regions of the input space that are far from any training point. Finally, we find that steady training with Dropout implies a training- and data-dependent generalization bound that grows poly-logarithmically with the number of parameters. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that good training behavior can be a useful bias towards good generalization. ",

A wrong scope definition can determine (in the worst case) project failure. A good scope definition become even more relevant in technological intensive innovation projects, nowadays characterized by a highly dynamic multidisciplinary, turbulent and uncertain environment. In these cases, the boundaries of the project are not easily detectable and it is difficult to decide what it is in-scope and out-of-scope. The present work proposes a tool for the scope delineation process, that automatically define an innovative technological field or a new technology. The tool is based on Text Mining algorithm that exploits Elsevier's Scopus abstracts in order to the extract relevant data to define a technological scope. The automatic definition tool is then applied on four case studies: Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. The results show how the tool can provide many crucial information in the definition process of a technological field. In particular for the target technological field (or technology), it provides the definition and other elements related to the target. ",

Unlike approaches that use domain-specific intermediate representations such as pose keypoints, NWT learns its own latent representations, with minimal assumptions about the audio and video content. To this end, we propose a novel discrete variational autoencoder with adversarial loss, dVAE-Adv, which learns a new discrete latent representation we call Memcodes. Memcodes are straightforward to implement, require no additional loss terms, are stable to train compared with other approaches, and show evidence of interpretability. To predict on the Memcode space, we use an autoregressive encoder-decoder model conditioned on audio. Additionally, our model can control latent attributes in the generated video that are not annotated in the data. We train NWT on clips from HBO's Last Week Tonight with John Oliver. NWT consistently scores above other approaches in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) on tests of overall video naturalness, facial naturalness and expressiveness, and lipsync quality. This work sets a strong baseline for generalized audio-to-video synthesis. Samples are available at https://next-week-tonight.github.io/NWT/. ",

However, most of the proposed Si programmable PICs for ONNs have several drawbacks such as low scalability, high power consumption, and lack of frameworks for training. To address these issues, we have proposed a microring resonator (MRR) crossbar array as a Si programmable PIC for an ONN. In this article, we present a prototype of a fully integrated 4 ${\\rm \\times}$ 4 MRR crossbar array and demonstrated a simple MVM and classification task. Moreover, we propose on-chip backpropagation using the transpose matrix operation of the MRR crossbar array, enabling the on-chip training of the ONN. The proposed ONN scheme can establish a scalable, power-efficient deep learning accelerator for applications in both inference and training tasks. ",

In this article, we compare the two main proof techniques that have been paving the way to a rigorous analysis, discuss their potential and limitations, and survey their successful applications. On the one hand, we review approaches based on descent cone analysis, showing that they often lead to strong guarantees even in the presence of adversarial noise, but face limitations when it comes to structured observations. On the other hand, we discuss techniques using approximate dual certificates and the golfing scheme, which are often better suited to deal with practical measurement structures, but sometimes lead to weaker guarantees. Lastly, we review recent progress towards analyzing descent cones also for structured scenarios -- exploiting the idea of splitting the cones into multiple parts that are analyzed via different techniques.

While AM dependency parsers have been shown to be fast and accurate across several graphbanks, they require explicit annotations of the compositional tree structures for training.

Here we show how they can instead be trained directly on the graphs with a neural latent-variable model, drastically reducing the amount and complexity of manual heuristics. We demonstrate that our model picks up on several linguistic phenomena on its own and achieves comparable accuracy to supervised training, greatly facilitating the use of AM dependency parsing for new sembanks.

The analysis is mainly performed by human inspectors manually analyzing recorded images.

In this paper, we present a novel deep learning Generative Adversarial Network model for generating ultrasonic B-scans with defects in distinct locations. Furthermore, we show that generated B-scans can be used for synthetic data augmentation, and can improve the performance of deep convolutional neural object detection networks. Our novel method is demonstrated on a dataset of almost 4000 B-scans with more than 6000 annotated defects. Defect detection performance when training on real data yielded average precision of 71%. By training only on generated data the results increased to 72.1%, and by mixing generated and real data we achieve 75.7% average precision.

We cannot avoid these conflicts but sometimes we may choose which interaction framework to use as a battlefield.

Both attitudes can be formulated via appropriately chosen traditional games. In particular, the prisoner's dilemma game is based on pair interaction while the public goods game represents multi-point interactions of group members. To reveal the possible advantage of a certain attitude we extend these models by allowing players not simply to change their strategies but also let them to vary their attitudes for a higher individual income. We show that both attitudes could be the winner at a specific parameter value. Interestingly, however, the subtle interplay between different states may result in a counterintuitive evolutionary outcome where the increase of the multiplication factor of public goods game drives the population to a fully defector state. We point out that the accompanying pattern formation can only be understood via the multipoint or multi-player interactions of different microscopic states where the vicinity of a particular state may influence the relation of two other competitors.

Whilst most polyps are benign, the number, size and the surface structure of the polyp are tightly linked to the risk of colon cancer. There exists a high missed detection rate and incomplete removal of colon polyps due to the variable nature, difficulties to delineate the abnormality, high recurrence rates and the anatomical topography of the colon. In the past, several methods have been built to automate polyp detection and segmentation. However, the key issue of most methods is that they have not been tested rigorously on a large multi-center purpose-built dataset. Thus, these methods may not generalise to different population datasets as they overfit to a specific population and endoscopic surveillance. To this extent, we have curated a dataset from 6 different centers incorporating more than 300 patients. The dataset includes both single frame and sequence data with 3446 annotated polyp labels with precise delineation of polyp boundaries verified by six senior gastroenterologists. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive detection and pixel-level segmentation dataset curated by a team of computational scientists and expert gastroenterologists. This dataset has been originated as the part of the Endocv2021 challenge aimed at addressing generalisability in polyp detection and segmentation.
