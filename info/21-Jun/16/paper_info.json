    "abstract": "We investigate scaling and efficiency of the deep neural network multigrid method (DNN-MG). DNN-MG is a novel neural network-based technique for the simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations that combines an adaptive geometric multigrid solver, i.e. a highly efficient classical solution scheme, with a recurrent neural network with memory. The neural network replaces in DNN-MG one or multiple finest multigrid layers and provides a correction for the classical solve in the next time step. This leads to little degradation in the solution quality while substantially reducing the overall computational costs. At the same time, the use of the multigrid solver at the coarse scales allows for a compact network that is easy to train, generalizes well, and allows for the incorporation of physical constraints. Previous work on DNN-MG focused on the overall scheme and how to enforce divergence freedom in the solution. In this work, we investigate how the network size affects training and solution quality and the overall runtime of the computations. Our results demonstrate that larger networks are able to capture the flow behavior better while requiring only little additional training time. At runtime, the use of the neural network correction can even reduce the computation time compared to a classical multigrid simulation through a faster convergence of the nonlinear solve that is required at every time step.

    "abstract": "Automatic speaker verification (ASV) is a well developed technology for biometric identification, and has been ubiquitous implemented in security-critic applications, such as banking and access control. However, previous works have shown that ASV is under the radar of adversarial attacks, which are very similar to their original counterparts from human's perception, yet will manipulate the ASV render wrong prediction. Due to the very late emergence of adversarial attacks for ASV, effective countermeasures against them are limited. Given that the security of ASV is of high priority, in this work, we propose the idea of \"voting for the right answer\" to prevent risky decisions of ASV in blind spot areas, by employing random sampling and voting. Experimental results show that our proposed method improves the robustness against both the limited-knowledge attackers by pulling the adversarial samples out of the blind spots, and the perfect-knowledge attackers by introducing randomness and increasing the attackers' budgets. The code for reproducing main results is available at https://github.com/thuhcsi/adsv_voting. ",

Aiming at the problem of the existing \"Latent Feature Guide Attribute Attention\" (LFGAA) zero-shot image classification network, the output latent attributes and artificially defined attributes are different in the semantic space, which leads to the problem of model performance degradation, proposed an LGFAA network based on semantic feedback, and improved model performance by constructing semantic embedded modules and feedback mechanisms. At the same time, for the common domain shift problem in zero-shot learning, based on the idea of co-training algorithm using the difference information between different views of data to learn from each other, we propose an Ensemble Co-training algorithm, which adaptively reduces the prediction error in image tag embedding from multiple angles. Various experiments conducted on the zero-shot dataset and the cylinder liner dataset in the industrial field provide competitive results. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved remarkable performance in various fields. However, training a DNN model from scratch requires a lot of computing resources and training data. It is difficult for most individual users to obtain such computing resources and training data. Model copyright infringement is an emerging problem in recent years. For instance, pre-trained models may be stolen or abuse by illegal users without the authorization of the model owner. Recently, many works on protecting the intellectual property of DNN models have been proposed. In these works, embedding watermarks into DNN based on backdoor is one of the widely used methods. However, when the DNN model is stolen, the backdoor-based watermark may face the risk of being detected and removed by an adversary. In this paper, we propose a scheme to detect and remove watermark in deep neural networks via generative adversarial networks (GAN). We demonstrate that the backdoor-based DNN watermarks are vulnerable to the proposed GAN-based watermark removal attack. The proposed attack method includes two phases. In the first phase, we use the GAN and few clean images to detect and reverse the watermark in the DNN model. In the second phase, we fine-tune the watermarked DNN based on the reversed backdoor images. Experimental evaluations on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate that, the proposed method can effectively remove about 98% of the watermark in DNN models, as the watermark retention rate reduces from 100% to less than 2% after applying the proposed attack. In the meantime, the proposed attack hardly affects the model's performance. The test accuracy of the watermarked DNN on the MNIST and the CIFAR10 datasets drops by less than 1% and 3%, respectively.

Adhesions are identified on cine-MRI by the absence of sliding motion during movement. Diagnosis and mapping of adhesions improves the management of patients with pain. Detection of abdominal adhesions on cine-MRI is challenging from both a radiological and deep learning perspective. We focus on classifying presence or absence of adhesions in sagittal abdominal cine-MRI series. We experimented with spatio-temporal deep learning architectures centered around a ConvGRU architecture. A hybrid architecture comprising a ResNet followed by a ConvGRU model allows to classify a whole time-series. Compared to a stand-alone ResNet with a two time-point (inspiration/expiration) input, we show an increase in classification performance (AUROC) from 0.74 to 0.83 ($p<0.05$). Our full temporal classification approach adds only a small amount (5%) of parameters to the entire architecture, which may be useful for other medical imaging problems with a temporal dimension. ",

    "abstract": "Timely, accurate and reliable assessment of fetal brain development is essential to reduce short and long-term risks to fetus and mother. Fetal MRI is increasingly used for fetal brain assessment. Three key biometric linear measurements important for fetal brain evaluation are Cerebral Biparietal Diameter (CBD), Bone Biparietal Diameter (BBD), and Trans-Cerebellum Diameter (TCD), obtained manually by expert radiologists on reference slices, which is time consuming and prone to human error. The aim of this study was to develop a fully automatic method computing the CBD, BBD and TCD measurements from fetal brain MRI. The input is fetal brain MRI volumes which may include the fetal body and the mother's abdomen. The outputs are the measurement values and reference slices on which the measurements were computed. The method, which follows the manual measurements principle, consists of five stages: 1) computation of a Region Of Interest that includes the fetal brain with an anisotropic 3D U-Net classifier; 2) reference slice selection with a Convolutional Neural Network; 3) slice-wise fetal brain structures segmentation with a multiclass U-Net classifier; 4) computation of the fetal brain midsagittal line and fetal brain orientation, and; 5) computation of the measurements. Experimental results on 214 volumes for CBD, BBD and TCD measurements yielded a mean $L_1$ difference of 1.55mm, 1.45mm and 1.23mm respectively, and a Bland-Altman 95% confidence interval ($CI_{95}$) of 3.92mm, 3.98mm and 2.25mm respectively. These results are similar to the manual inter-observer variability. The proposed automatic method for computing biometric linear measurements of the fetal brain from MR imaging achieves human level performance. It has the potential of being a useful method for the assessment of fetal brain biometry in normal and pathological cases, and of improving routine clinical practice. ",

    "abstract": "The growing demand for head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, along with a global shortage of radiologists, has led to an increase in the time taken to report head MRI scans around the world. For many neurological conditions, this delay can result in increased morbidity and mortality. An automated triaging tool could reduce reporting times for abnormal examinations by identifying abnormalities at the time of imaging and prioritizing the reporting of these scans. In this work, we present a convolutional neural network for detecting clinically-relevant abnormalities in $\\text{T}_2$-weighted head MRI scans. Using a validated neuroradiology report classifier, we generated a labelled dataset of 43,754 scans from two large UK hospitals for model training, and demonstrate accurate classification (area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) = 0.943) on a test set of 800 scans labelled by a team of neuroradiologists. Importantly, when trained on scans from only a single hospital the model generalized to scans from the other hospital ($\\Delta$AUC $\\leq$ 0.02). A simulation study demonstrated that our model would reduce the mean reporting time for abnormal examinations from 28 days to 14 days and from 9 days to 5 days at the two hospitals, demonstrating feasibility for use in a clinical triage environment.
