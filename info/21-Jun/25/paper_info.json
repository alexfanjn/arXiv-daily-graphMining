    "title": "Minimum sharpness: Scale-invariant parameter-robustness of neural  networks",
    "abstract": "Toward achieving robust and defensive neural networks, the robustness against the weight parameters perturbations, i.e., sharpness, attracts attention in recent years (Sun et al., 2020). However, sharpness is known to remain a critical issue, \"scale-sensitivity.\" In this paper, we propose a novel sharpness measure, Minimum Sharpness. It is known that NNs have a specific scale transformation that constitutes equivalent classes where functional properties are completely identical, and at the same time, their sharpness could change unlimitedly. We define our sharpness through a minimization problem over the equivalent NNs being invariant to the scale transformation. We also develop an efficient and exact technique to make the sharpness tractable, which reduces the heavy computational costs involved with Hessian. In the experiment, we observed that our sharpness has a valid correlation with the generalization of NNs and runs with less computational cost than existing sharpness measures. ",

    "abstract": "The claims data, containing medical codes, services information, and incurred expenditure, can be a good resource for estimating an individual's health condition and medical risk level. In this study, we developed Transformer-based Multimodal AutoEncoder (TMAE), an unsupervised learning framework that can learn efficient patient representation by encoding meaningful information from the claims data. TMAE is motivated by the practical needs in healthcare to stratify patients into different risk levels for improving care delivery and management. Compared to previous approaches, TMAE is able to 1) model inpatient, outpatient, and medication claims collectively, 2) handle irregular time intervals between medical events, 3) alleviate the sparsity issue of the rare medical codes, and 4) incorporate medical expenditure information. We trained TMAE using a real-world pediatric claims dataset containing more than 600,000 patients and compared its performance with various approaches in two clustering tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that TMAE has superior performance compared to all baselines. Multiple downstream applications are also conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework. The promising results confirm that the TMAE framework is scalable to large claims data and is able to generate efficient patient embeddings for risk stratification and analysis. ",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Leverage existing biomedical NLP tools and DS domain terminology to produce a novel and comprehensive knowledge graph containing dietary supplement (DS) information for discovering interactions between DS and drugs, or Drug-Supplement Interactions (DSI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created SemRepDS (an extension of SemRep), capable of extracting semantic relations from abstracts by leveraging a DS-specific terminology (iDISK) containing 28,884 DS terms not found in the UMLS. PubMed abstracts were processed using SemRepDS to generate semantic relations, which were then filtered using a PubMedBERT-based model to remove incorrect relations before generating our knowledge graph (SuppKG). Two pathways are used to identify potential DS-Drug interactions which are then evaluated by medical professionals for mechanistic plausibility. RESULTS: Comparison analysis found that SemRepDS returned 206.9% more DS relations and 158.5% more DS entities than SemRep. The fine-tuned BERT model obtained an F1 score of 0.8605 and removed 43.86% of the relations, improving the precision of the relations by 26.4% compared to pre-filtering. SuppKG consists of 2,928 DS-specific nodes. Manual review of findings identified 44 (88%) proposed DS-Gene-Drug and 32 (64%) proposed DS-Gene1-Function-Gene2-Drug pathways to be mechanistically plausible. DISCUSSION: The additional relations extracted using SemRepDS generated SuppKG that was used to find plausible DSI not found in the current literature. By the nature of the SuppKG, these interactions are unlikely to have been found using SemRep without the expanded DS terminology. CONCLUSION: We successfully extend SemRep to include DS information and produce SuppKG which can be used to find potential DS-Drug interactions. ",

We start with a rich word embedding pre-trained from a large general dataset, which is then augmented with embeddings learned from a much smaller and more specific domain dataset through a simple non-linear mapping mechanism. We also experimented with several other more sophisticated methods of such mapping including, several auto-encoder based and custom loss-function based methods that learn embedding representations through gradually learning to be close to the words of similar semantics and distant to dissimilar semantics. Our strengthened representations better capture the semantics of the depression domain, as it combines the semantics learned from the specific domain coupled with word coverage from the general language. We also present a comparative performance analyses of our word embedding representations with a simple bag-of-words model, well known sentiment and psycholinguistic lexicons, and a general pre-trained word embedding. When used as feature representations for several different machine learning methods, including deep learning models in a depressive Tweets identification task, we show that our augmented word embedding representations achieve a significantly better F1 score than the others, specially when applied to a high quality dataset. Also, we present several data ablation tests which confirm the efficacy of our augmentation techniques. ",

The study is focused on frequency domain test statistics based on the eigenvalues of an estimate of the spectral coherence matrix (SCM), obtained as a renormalization of the frequency-smoothed periodogram of the observed signal. If N denotes the sample size and B the smoothing span, it is proved that in the high-dimensional regime where M, B, N converge to infinity while K remains fixed, the SCM behaves as a certain correlated Wishart matrix. Exploiting well-known results on the behaviour of the eigenvalues of such matrices, it is deduced that the standard tests based on linear spectral statistics of the SCM fail to detect the presence of the useful signal in the high-dimensional regime. A new test based on the SCM, which is proved to be consistent, is also proposed, and its statistical performance is evaluated through numerical simulations. ",

We utilized the SARIMAX, Linear regression model to anticipate new suspected COVID-19 cases for the countries which did not converge yet.

We present new information investigation-based forecast results that can assist governments with planning their future activities and help clinical administrations to be more ready for what's to come. Our framework can foresee peak corona cases with an R-Squared value of 0.986 utilizing linear regression and fall of this pandemic at various levels for countries like India, US, and Brazil.

    "abstract": "With the rise of machine learning and deep learning based applications in practice, monitoring, i.e. verifying that these operate within specification, has become an important practical problem. An important aspect of this monitoring is to check whether the inputs (or intermediates) have strayed from the distribution they were validated for, which can void the performance assurances obtained during testing. There are two common approaches for this. The, perhaps, more classical one is outlier detection or novelty detection, where, for a single input we ask whether it is an outlier, i.e. exceedingly unlikely to have originated from a reference distribution. The second, perhaps more recent approach, is to consider a larger number of inputs and compare its distribution to a reference distribution (e.g. sampled during testing). This is done under the label drift detection. In this work, we bridge the gap between outlier detection and drift detection through comparing a given number of inputs to an automatically chosen part of the reference distribution. ",

However, traditional algorithms such as frame difference and optical flow usually suffer from low accuracy or heavy computation. Recent algorithms such as deep learning-based convolutional neural networks have achieved high accuracy and real-time performance, but they usually need to know the classes of targets in advance, which limits the practical applications. Therefore, we proposed a model free moving target detection algorithm. This algorithm extracts the moving area through the difference of image features. Then, the color and location probability map of the moving area will be calculated through maximum a posteriori probability. And the target probability map can be obtained through the dot multiply between the two maps. Finally, the optimal moving target area can be solved by stochastic gradient descent on the target probability map. Results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the highest accuracy compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, without needing to know the classes of targets. Furthermore, as the existing datasets are not suitable for moving target detection, we proposed a method for producing evaluation dataset. Besides, we also proved the proposed algorithm can be used to assist target tracking. ",

The evaluation of spinal bone lesions, however, is a challenging task for radiologists. This work aims at developing and evaluating a deep learning-based framework, named VinDr-SpineXR, for the classification and localization of abnormalities from spine X-rays. First, we build a large dataset, comprising 10,468 spine X-ray images from 5,000 studies, each of which is manually annotated by an experienced radiologist with bounding boxes around abnormal findings in 13 categories. Using this dataset, we then train a deep learning classifier to determine whether a spine scan is abnormal and a detector to localize 7 crucial findings amongst the total 13. The VinDr-SpineXR is evaluated on a test set of 2,078 images from 1,000 studies, which is kept separate from the training set. It demonstrates an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 88.61% (95% CI 87.19%, 90.02%) for the image-level classification task and a mean average precision (mAP@0.5) of 33.56% for the lesion-level localization task.

Despite the great potential, however, existing tensor-network-based unsupervised models only work as a proof of principle, as their performances are much worse than the standard models such as the restricted Boltzmann machines and neural networks.
