    "abstract": "People differ in how they attend to, interpret, and respond to their surroundings. Convergent processing of the world may be one factor that contributes to social connections between individuals. We used neuroimaging and network analysis to investigate whether the most central individuals in their communities (as measured by in-degree centrality, a notion of popularity) process the world in a particularly normative way. More central individuals had exceptionally similar neural responses to their peers and especially to each other in brain regions associated with high-level interpretations and social cognition (e.g., in the default-mode network), whereas less-central individuals exhibited more idiosyncratic responses. Self-reported enjoyment of and interest in stimuli followed a similar pattern, but accounting for these data did not change our main results. These findings suggest an \"Anna Karenina principle\" in social networks: Highly-central individuals process the world in exceptionally similar ways, whereas less-central individuals process the world in idiosyncratic ways.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks excel at image classification, but their performance is far less robust to input perturbations than human perception. In this work we explore whether this shortcoming may be partly addressed by incorporating brain-inspired recurrent dynamics in deep convolutional networks. We take inspiration from a popular framework in neuroscience: 'predictive coding'. At each layer of the hierarchical model, generative feedback 'predicts' (i.e., reconstructs) the pattern of activity in the previous layer. The reconstruction errors are used to iteratively update the network's representations across timesteps, and to optimize the network's feedback weights over the natural image dataset-a form of unsupervised training. We show that implementing this strategy into two popular networks, VGG16 and EfficientNetB0, improves their robustness against various corruptions. We hypothesize that other feedforward networks could similarly benefit from the proposed framework. To promote research in this direction, we provide an open-sourced PyTorch-based package called Predify, which can be used to implement and investigate the impacts of the predictive coding dynamics in any convolutional neural network.

In this context, a centralized system is needed for effective monitoring and analysis of the medical records. A web-based patient diagnostic system is a central platform to store the medical history and predict the possible disease based on the current symptoms experienced by a patient to ensure faster and accurate diagnosis. Early disease prediction can help the users determine the severity of the disease and take quick action. The proposed web-based disease prediction system utilizes machine learning based classification techniques on a data set acquired from the National Centre of Disease Control (NCDC). $K$-nearest neighbor (K-NN), random forest and naive bayes classification approaches are utilized and an ensemble voting algorithm is also proposed where each classifier is assigned weights dynamically based on the prediction confidence. The proposed system is also equipped with a recommendation scheme to recommend the type of tests based on the existing symptoms of the patient, so that necessary precautions can be taken. A centralized database ensures that the medical data is preserved and there is transparency in the system. The tampering into the system is prevented by giving the no \"updation\" rights once the diagnosis is created. ",

This is challenging even for humans, leading to shortage of annotated data, a fact that makes the task even more difficult for supervised machine learning approaches. In the current study, we perform implicit discourse relation classification without relying on any labeled implicit relation. We sidestep the lack of data through explicitation of implicit relations to reduce the task to two sub-problems: language modeling and explicit discourse relation classification, a much easier problem. Our experimental results show that this method can even marginally outperform the state-of-the-art, in spite of being much simpler than alternative models of comparable performance. Moreover, we show that the achieved performance is robust across domains as suggested by the zero-shot experiments on a completely different domain. This indicates that recent advances in language modeling have made language models sufficiently good at capturing inter-sentence relations without the help of explicit discourse markers. ",

The optimal resolution may vary significantly depending on the dataset. Modern CNNs hard-code their resolution hyper-parameters in the network architecture which makes tuning such hyper-parameters cumbersome. We propose to do away with hard-coded resolution hyper-parameters and aim to learn the appropriate resolution from data. We use scale-space theory to obtain a self-similar parametrization of filters and make use of the N-Jet: a truncated Taylor series to approximate a filter by a learned combination of Gaussian derivative filters. The parameter {\\sigma} of the Gaussian basis controls both the amount of detail the filter encodes and the spatial extent of the filter. Since {\\sigma} is a continuous parameter, we can optimize it with respect to the loss. The proposed N-Jet layer achieves comparable performance when used in state-of-the art architectures, while learning the correct resolution in each layer automatically. We evaluate our N-Jet layer on both classification and segmentation, and we show that learning {\\sigma} is especially beneficial for inputs at multiple sizes. ",

However, an essential problem remains unsolved: most of the methods require large computational cost and memory usage for training. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating future prediction videos with less memory usage than the conventional methods. This is a critical stepping stone in the path towards generating videos with high image quality, similar to that of generated images in the latest works in the field of image generation. We achieve high-efficiency by training our method in two stages: (1) image reconstruction to encode video frames into latent variables, and (2) latent variable prediction to generate the future sequence. Our method achieves an efficient compression of video into low-dimensional latent variables by decomposing each frame according to its hierarchical structure. That is, we consider that video can be separated into background and foreground objects, and that each object holds time-varying and time-independent information independently. Our experiments show that the proposed method can efficiently generate future prediction videos, even for complex datasets that cannot be handled by previous methods. ",

On networks, the topological wave function describes the dynamics of topological signals or cochains, i.e. dynamical signals defined both on nodes and on links. On simplicial complexes the wave function is also defined on higher-dimensional simplices. Therefore the topological wave function satisfies a relaxed condition of locality as it acquires the same value along simplices of dimension larger than zero. The topological Dirac equation defines eigenstates whose dispersion relation is determined by the spectral properties of the Dirac (or chiral) operator defined on networks and generalized network structures including simplicial complexes and multiplex networks. On simplicial complexes the Dirac equation leads to multiple energy bands. On multiplex networks the topological Dirac equation can be generalized to distinguish between different mutlilinks leading to a natural definition of rotations of the topological spinor. The topological Dirac equation is here initially formulated on a spatial network or simplicial complex for describing the evolution of the topological wave function in continuous time. This framework is also extended to treat the topological Dirac equation on $1+d$ spaces describing a discrete space-time with one temporal dimension and $d$ spatial dimensions with $d\\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. This work includes also the discussion of numerical results obtained by implementing the topological Dirac equation on simplicial complex models and on real simple and multiplex network data. ",

This approach can be used to generate materials candidates for a designated property, thereby satisfying the highly sought-after goal of inverse design. We then apply this framework to the task of band gap engineering in two-dimensional materials, starting with MoS2. Within the design space encompassing six degrees of freedom in applied tensile, compressive and shear strain plus an external electric field, we show the framework can generate novel, high fidelity, and diverse candidates with near-chemical accuracy. We extend this generative capability further to provide insights regarding metal-insulator transition, important for memristive neuromorphic applications among others, in MoS2 which is not otherwise possible with brute force screening.

The idea of the approach is to calculate a set of k feasible solutions which are worst-case optimal if in each possible scenario the best of the k solutions would be implemented. It is known that the min-max-min robust problem can be solved efficiently if k is at least the dimension of the problem, while it is theoretically and computationally hard if k is small. While both cases are well studied in the literature nothing is known about the intermediate case, namely if k is smaller than but close to the dimension of the problem. We approach this open question and show that for a selection of combinatorial problems the min-max-min problem can be solved exactly and approximately in polynomial time if some problem specific values are fixed. Furthermore we approach a second open question and present the first implementable algorithm with pseudopolynomial runtime for the case that k is at least the dimension of the problem. The algorithm is based on a projected subgradient method where the projection problem is solved by the classical Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Additionally we derive a branch & bound method to solve the min-max-min problem for arbitrary values of k and perform tests on knapsack and shortest path instances. The experiments show that despite its theoretical impact the projected subgradient method cannot compete with an already existing method. On the other hand the performance of the branch & bound method scales very well with the number of solutions. Thus we are able to solve instances where k is above some small threshold very efficiently. ",

Here, we study the last layer representation of various deep architectures such as Wide-ResNets for image classification and find evidence for an underlying mechanism that we call *representation mitosis*: if the last hidden representation is wide enough, its neurons tend to split into groups which carry identical information, and differ from each other only by a statistically independent noise. Like in a mitosis process, the number of such groups, or ``clones'', increases linearly with the width of the layer, but only if the width is above a critical value. We show that a key ingredient to activate mitosis is continuing the training process until the training error is zero. Finally, we show that in one of the learning tasks we considered, a wide model with several automatically developed clones performs significantly better than a deep ensemble based on architectures in which the last layer has the same size as the clones.

Specifically, we approximate the unknown dynamics with a finite expansion in $\\textit{random}$ basis functions, and provide an explicit guarantee on the number of random features needed to track a desired trajectory with high probability. Remarkably, our explicit bounds only depend $\\textit{polynomially}$ on the underlying parameters of the system, allowing our proposed algorithms to efficiently scale to high-dimensional systems.

Our method is able to recover the ODE system without being subject to the curse of dimensionality and complicated ODE structure. When the ODE possesses a general modular structure, with each modular component involving only a few input variables, and the network architecture is properly chosen, our method is proven to be consistent. Theoretical properties are corroborated by an extensive simulation study that demonstrates the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, we use our method to simultaneously characterize the growth rate of Covid-19 infection cases from 50 states of the USA. ",

    "title": "Synthesis of standard 12-lead electrocardiograms using two dimensional  generative adversarial network",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a two-dimensional (2D) bidirectional long short-term memory generative adversarial network (GAN) to produce synthetic standard 12-lead ECGs corresponding to four types of signals: left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left branch bundle block (LBBB), acute myocardial infarction (ACUTMI), and Normal. It uses a fully automatic end-to-end process to generate and verify the synthetic ECGs that does not require any visual inspection. The proposed model is able to produce synthetic standard 12-lead ECG signals with success rates of 98% for LVH, 93% for LBBB, 79% for ACUTMI, and 59% for Normal. Statistical evaluation of the data confirms that the synthetic ECGs are not biased towards or overfitted to the training ECGs, and span a wide range of morphological features. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to use a 2D GAN to produce standard 12-lead ECGs suitable to augment artificially a diverse database of real ECGs, thus providing a possible solution to the demand for extensive ECG datasets.

    "title": "Traction chain networks: Insights beyond force chain networks for  non-spherical particle systems",
    "abstract": "Force chain networks are generally applied in granular materials to gain insight into inter-particle granular contact. For conservative spherical particle systems, i.e. frictionless and undamped, force chains are information complete due to symmetries resulting from isotropy and constant curvature of a sphere. In fact, for conservative spherical particle systems, given the geometry and material, the force chain network uniquely defines the contact state that includes elastic forces, penetration distance, overlap volume, contact areas and contact pressures in a particle system. This is, however, not the case for conservative non-spherical particle systems. The reason is that a force chain network is not sufficient to uniquely define the contact state in a conservative non-spherical particle system. Additional information is required to define the contact state of non-spherical granular systems. Traction chain networks are proposed to complement force chain networks for the improved quantification of the state of contact of a granular system. ",

    "abstract": "Although Shapley Values (SV) are widely used in explainable AI, they can be poorly understood and estimated, which implies that their analysis may lead to spurious inferences and explanations. As a starting point, we remind an invariance principle for SV and derive the correct approach for computing the SV of categorical variables that are particularly sensitive to the encoding used. In the case of tree-based models, we introduce two estimators of Shapley Values that exploit efficiently the tree structure and are more accurate than state-of-the-art methods. For interpreting additive explanations, we recommend to filter the non-influential variables and to compute the Shapley Values only for groups of influential variables. For this purpose, we use the concept of \"Same Decision Probability\" (SDP) that evaluates the robustness of a prediction when some variables are missing. This prior selection procedure produces sparse additive explanations easier to visualize and analyse. Simulations and comparisons are performed with state-of-the-art algorithm, and show the practical gain of our approach. ",
