    "abstract": "In this paper we present a benchmark dataset generated as part of a project for automatic identification of misogyny within online content, which focuses in particular on memes. The benchmark here described is composed of 800 memes collected from the most popular social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Reddit, and consulting websites dedicated to collection and creation of memes. To gather misogynistic memes, specific keywords that refer to misogynistic content have been considered as search criterion, considering different manifestations of hatred against women, such as body shaming, stereotyping, objectification and violence. In parallel, memes with no misogynist content have been manually downloaded from the same web sources. Among all the collected memes, three domain experts have selected a dataset of 800 memes equally balanced between misogynistic and non-misogynistic ones. This dataset has been validated through a crowdsourcing platform, involving 60 subjects for the labelling process, in order to collect three evaluations for each instance. Two further binary labels have been collected from both the experts and the crowdsourcing platform, for memes evaluated as misogynistic, concerning aggressiveness and irony. Finally for each meme, the text has been manually transcribed. The dataset provided is thus composed of the 800 memes, the labels given by the experts and those obtained by the crowdsourcing validation, and the transcribed texts. This data can be used to approach the problem of automatic detection of misogynistic content on the Web relying on both textual and visual cues, facing phenomenons that are growing every day such as cybersexism and technology-facilitated violence.

    "abstract": "Predicting the future motion of multiple agents is necessary for planning in dynamic environments. This task is challenging for autonomous driving since agents (e.g., vehicles and pedestrians) and their associated behaviors may be diverse and influence each other. Most prior work has focused on first predicting independent futures for each agent based on all past motion, and then planning against these independent predictions. However, planning against fixed predictions can suffer from the inability to represent the future interaction possibilities between different agents, leading to sub-optimal planning. In this work, we formulate a model for predicting the behavior of all agents jointly in real-world driving environments in a unified manner. Inspired by recent language modeling approaches, we use a masking strategy as the query to our model, enabling one to invoke a single model to predict agent behavior in many ways, such as potentially conditioned on the goal or full future trajectory of the autonomous vehicle or the behavior of other agents in the environment. Our model architecture fuses heterogeneous world state in a unified Transformer architecture by employing attention across road elements, agent interactions and time steps. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving datasets for behavior prediction, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work demonstrates that formulating the problem of behavior prediction in a unified architecture with a masking strategy may allow us to have a single model that can perform multiple motion prediction and planning related tasks effectively.

    "abstract": "Contemporary grasp detection approaches employ deep learning to achieve robustness to sensor and object model uncertainty. The two dominant approaches design either grasp-quality scoring or anchor-based grasp recognition networks. This paper presents a different approach to grasp detection by treating it as keypoint detection. The deep network detects each grasp candidate as a pair of keypoints, convertible to the grasp representation g = {x, y, w, {\\theta}}^T, rather than a triplet or quartet of corner points. Decreasing the detection difficulty by grouping keypoints into pairs boosts performance. To further promote dependencies between keypoints, the general non-local module is incorporated into the proposed learning framework. A final filtering strategy based on discrete and continuous orientation prediction removes false correspondences and further improves grasp detection performance. GKNet, the approach presented here, achieves the best balance of accuracy and speed on the Cornell and the abridged Jacquard dataset (96.9% and 98.39% at 41.67 and 23.26 fps). Follow-up experiments on a manipulator evaluate GKNet using 4 types of grasping experiments reflecting different nuisance sources: static grasping, dynamic grasping, grasping at varied camera angles, and bin picking. GKNet outperforms reference baselines in static and dynamic grasping experiments while showing robustness to varied camera viewpoints and bin picking experiments. The results confirm the hypothesis that grasp keypoints are an effective output representation for deep grasp networks that provide robustness to expected nuisance factors. ",

    "abstract": "The integrated positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) scanner facilitates the simultaneous acquisition of metabolic information via PET and morphological information with high soft-tissue contrast using MRI. Although PET/MRI facilitates the capture of high-accuracy fusion images, its major drawback can be attributed to the difficulty encountered when performing attenuation correction, which is necessary for quantitative PET evaluation. The combined PET/MRI scanning requires the generation of attenuation-correction maps from MRI owing to no direct relationship between the gamma-ray attenuation information and MRIs. While MRI-based bone-tissue segmentation can be readily performed for the head and pelvis regions, the realization of accurate bone segmentation via chest CT generation remains a challenging task. This can be attributed to the respiratory and cardiac motions occurring in the chest as well as its anatomically complicated structure and relatively thin bone cortex. This paper presents a means to minimise the anatomical structural changes without human annotation by adding structural constraints using a modality-independent neighbourhood descriptor (MIND) to a generative adversarial network (GAN) that can transform unpaired images. The results obtained in this study revealed the proposed U-GAT-IT + MIND approach to outperform all other competing approaches. The findings of this study hint towards possibility of synthesising clinically acceptable CT images from chest MRI without human annotation, thereby minimising the changes in the anatomical structure.

    "abstract": "Multiple attacks have shown that in-vehicle networks have vulnerabilities which can be exploited. Securing the Controller Area Network (CAN) for modern vehicles has become a necessary task for car manufacturers. Some attacks inject potentially large amount of fake messages into the CAN network; however, such attacks are relatively easy to detect. In more sophisticated attacks, the original messages are modified, making the de- tection a more complex problem. In this paper, we present a novel machine learning based intrusion detection method for CAN networks. We focus on detecting message modification attacks, which do not change the timing patterns of communications. Our proposed temporal convolutional network-based solution can learn the normal behavior of CAN signals and differentiate them from malicious ones. The method is evaluated on multiple CAN-bus message IDs from two public datasets including different types of attacks. Performance results show that our lightweight approach compares favorably to the state-of-the-art unsupervised learning approach, achieving similar or better accuracy for a wide range of scenarios with a significantly lower false positive rate.

Random feature neural networks are single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks in which only the output weights are trainable. This makes training particularly simple, but (a priori) reduces expressivity. Interestingly, this is not the case for Black-Scholes type PDEs, as we show here. We derive bounds for the prediction error of random neural networks for learning sufficiently non-degenerate Black-Scholes type models. A full error analysis is provided and it is shown that the derived bounds do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. We also investigate an application of these results to basket options and validate the bounds numerically. These results prove that neural networks are able to \\textit{learn} solutions to Black-Scholes type PDEs without the curse of dimensionality. In addition, this provides an example of a relevant learning problem in which random feature neural networks are provably efficient. ",

    "abstract": "Wind power is seeing a strong growth around the world. At the same time, shrinking profit margins in the energy markets let wind farm managers explore options for cost reductions in the turbine operation and maintenance. Sensor-based condition monitoring facilitates remote diagnostics of turbine subsystems, enabling faster responses when unforeseen maintenance is required. Condition monitoring with data from the turbines' supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems was proposed and SCADA-based fault detection and diagnosis approaches introduced based on single-task normal operation models of turbine state variables. As the number of SCADA channels has grown strongly, thousands of independent single-target models are in place today for monitoring a single turbine. Multi-target learning was recently proposed to limit the number of models. This study applied multi-target neural networks to the task of early fault detection in drive-train components. The accuracy and delay of detecting gear bearing faults were compared to state-of-the-art single-target approaches. We found that multi-target multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) detected faults at least as early and in many cases earlier than single-target MLPs. The multi-target MLPs could detect faults up to several days earlier than the single-target models. This can deliver a significant advantage in the planning and performance of maintenance work. At the same time, the multi-target MLPs achieved the same level of prediction stability. ",

Inspired by this, we aim to construct learning dynamics where potentially beneficial social norms can emerge. Since social norms are underpinned by sanctioning, we introduce a training regime where agents can access all sanctioning events but learning is otherwise decentralized. This setting is technologically interesting because sanctioning events may be the only available public signal in decentralized multi-agent systems where reward or policy-sharing is infeasible or undesirable. To achieve collective action in this setting we construct an agent architecture containing a classifier module that categorizes observed behaviors as approved or disapproved, and a motivation to punish in accord with the group. We show that social norms emerge in multi-agent systems containing this agent and investigate the conditions under which this helps them achieve socially beneficial outcomes. ",

We do this by reducing the problem to imperfect ($P_6$, diamond)-free graphs via the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem, dividing the imperfect graphs into several cases, and giving a proper colouring for each case. We also show that there is exactly one 6-vertex-critical ($P_6$, diamond, $K_6$)-free graph. Together with the Lov\\'asz theta function, this gives a polynomial time algorithm to compute the chromatic number of ($P_6$, diamond)-free graphs. ",

We study this problem within a teacher-student framework for kernel regression, using `convolutional' kernels inspired by the neural tangent kernel of simple convolutional architectures of given filter size. Using heuristic methods from physics, we find in the ridgeless case that locality is key in determining the learning curve exponent $\\beta$ (that relates the test error $\\epsilon_t\\sim P^{-\\beta}$ to the size of the training set $P$), whereas translational invariance is not. In particular, if the filter size of the teacher $t$ is smaller than that of the student $s$, $\\beta$ is a function of $s$ only and does not depend on the input dimension. We confirm our predictions on $\\beta$ empirically. Theoretically, in some cases (including when teacher and student are equal) it can be shown that this prediction is an upper bound on performance. We conclude by proving, using a natural universality assumption, that performing kernel regression with a ridge that decreases with the size of the training set leads to similar learning curve exponents to those we obtain in the ridgeless case.

As a case study, we improve expressive speech vocoding with a revamped Parallel Wavenet (PW).

The greater expressiveness of the improved PW leads to better-perceived signal quality and naturalness in the waveform reconstruction and text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. We evaluate the model across different speaking styles on a multi-speaker, multi-lingual dataset. In the waveform reconstruction task, the proposed model closes the naturalness and signal quality gap from the original PW to recordings by $10\\%$, and from other state-of-the-art neural vocoding systems by more than $60\\%$. We also demonstrate improvements in objective metrics on the evaluation test set with L2 Spectral Distance and Cross-Entropy reduced by $3\\%$ and $6\\unicode{x2030}$ comparing to the affine PW.

There exist interesting visualizations of the inner workings of these and other classifiers. Here we pursue a different goal, which is to visualize the cases being classified, either in training data or in test data. An important aspect is whether a case has been classified to its given class (label) or whether the classifier wants to assign it to different class. This is reflected in the (conditional and posterior) probability of the alternative class (PAC). A high PAC indicates label bias, i.e. the possibility that the case was mislabeled. The PAC is used to construct a silhouette plot which is similar in spirit to the silhouette plot for cluster analysis (Rousseeuw, 1987). The average silhouette width can be used to compare different classifications of the same dataset. We will also draw quasi residual plots of the PAC versus a data feature, which may lead to more insight in the data. One of these data features is how far each case lies from its given class.

Moreover, this system is subjected to usual thermodynamic cycles, such as adiabatic expansion and isochoric heating, resulting in a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). In this picture, we show that learning is seen as a demon that operates in cycles using feedback measurements to extract negative work from the system.
