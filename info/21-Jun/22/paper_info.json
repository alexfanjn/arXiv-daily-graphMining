    "title": "A system of vision sensor based deep neural networks for complex driving  scene analysis in support of crash risk assessment and prevention",
    "abstract": "To assist human drivers and autonomous vehicles in assessing crash risks, driving scene analysis using dash cameras on vehicles and deep learning algorithms is of paramount importance. Although these technologies are increasingly available, driving scene analysis for this purpose still remains a challenge. This is mainly due to the lack of annotated large image datasets for analyzing crash risk indicators and crash likelihood, and the lack of an effective method to extract lots of required information from complex driving scenes. To fill the gap, this paper develops a scene analysis system. The Multi-Net of the system includes two multi-task neural networks that perform scene classification to provide four labels for each scene. The DeepLab v3 and YOLO v3 are combined by the system to detect and locate risky pedestrians and the nearest vehicles. All identified information can provide the situational awareness to autonomous vehicles or human drivers for identifying crash risks from the surrounding traffic. To address the scarcity of annotated image datasets for studying traffic crashes, two completely new datasets have been developed by this paper and made available to the public, which were proved to be effective in training the proposed deep neural networks. The paper further evaluates the performance of the Multi-Net and the efficiency of the developed system. Comprehensive scene analysis is further illustrated with representative examples. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed system and datasets for driving scene analysis, and their supportiveness for crash risk assessment and crash prevention. ",

    "title": "Improving robustness of one-shot voice conversion with deep  discriminative speaker encoder",
    "abstract": "One-shot voice conversion has received significant attention since only one utterance from source speaker and target speaker respectively is required. Moreover, source speaker and target speaker do not need to be seen during training. However, available one-shot voice conversion approaches are not stable for unseen speakers as the speaker embedding extracted from one utterance of an unseen speaker is not reliable. In this paper, we propose a deep discriminative speaker encoder to extract speaker embedding from one utterance more effectively. Specifically, the speaker encoder first integrates residual network and squeeze-and-excitation network to extract discriminative speaker information in frame level by modeling frame-wise and channel-wise interdependence in features. Then attention mechanism is introduced to further emphasize speaker related information via assigning different weights to frame level speaker information. Finally a statistic pooling layer is used to aggregate weighted frame level speaker information to form utterance level speaker embedding. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed speaker encoder can improve the robustness of one-shot voice conversion for unseen speakers and outperforms baseline systems in terms of speech quality and speaker similarity.

The global feature importance and local feature contributions are examined by three gradient-based methods: Integrated Gradients, Expected Gradients, and DeepLIFT.

It has been documented that there are significant differences in the language used by a person with emotional disorders in comparison to a healthy individual. Still, the effectiveness of these lexical approaches could be improved further because the current analysis focuses on what the social media entries are about, and not how they are written. In this study, we focus on aspects in which these short texts are similar to each other, and how they were created. We present an innovative approach to the depression screening problem by applying Collgram analysis, which is a known effective method of obtaining linguistic information from texts. We compare these results with sentiment analysis based on the BERT architecture. Finally, we create a hybrid model achieving a diagnostic accuracy of 71%. ",

Although scatter plot representations of DR results allow for cluster identification and similarity analysis, such a visual metaphor presents problems when the number of instances of the dataset increases, resulting in cluttered visualizations. In this work, we propose a scatter plot-based multilevel approach to display DR results and address clutter-related problems when visualizing large datasets, together with the definition of a methodology to use focus+context interaction on non-hierarchical embeddings. The proposed technique, called ExplorerTree, uses a sampling selection technique on scatter plots to reduce visual clutter and guide users through exploratory tasks. We demonstrate ExplorerTree's effectiveness through a use case, where we visually explore activation images of the convolutional layers of a neural network. Finally, we also conducted a user experiment to evaluate ExplorerTree's ability to convey embedding structures using different sampling strategies. ",

    "abstract": "In critical infrastructures like airports, much care has to be devoted in protecting radio communication networks from external electromagnetic interference. Protection of such mission-critical radio communication networks is usually tackled by exploiting radiogoniometers: at least three suitably deployed radiogoniometers, and a gateway gathering information from them, permit to monitor and localise sources of electromagnetic emissions that are not supposed to be present in the monitored area. Typically, radiogoniometers are connected to the gateway through relay nodes. As a result, some degree of fault-tolerance for the network of relay nodes is essential in order to offer a reliable monitoring. On the other hand, deployment of relay nodes is typically quite expensive. As a result, we have two conflicting requirements: minimise costs while guaranteeing a given fault-tolerance. In this paper, we address the problem of computing a deployment for relay nodes that minimises the relay node network cost while at the same time guaranteeing proper working of the network even when some of the relay nodes (up to a given maximum number) become faulty (fault-tolerance). We show that, by means of a computation-intensive pre-processing on a HPC infrastructure, the above optimisation problem can be encoded as a 0/1 Linear Program, becoming suitable to be approached with standard Artificial Intelligence reasoners like MILP, PB-SAT, and SMT/OMT solvers. Our problem formulation enables us to present experimental results comparing the performance of these three solving technologies on a real case study of a relay node network deployment in areas of the Leonardo da Vinci Airport in Rome, Italy.

This paper provides a meta-mapping of research questions in the social and health sciences to appropriate ML approaches, by incorporating the necessary requirements to statistical analysis in these disciplines. We map the established classification into description, prediction, and causal inference to common research goals, such as estimating prevalence of adverse health or social outcomes, predicting the risk of an event, and identifying risk factors or causes of adverse outcomes. This meta-mapping aims at overcoming disciplinary barriers and starting a fluid dialogue between researchers from the social and health sciences and methodologically trained researchers. Such mapping may also help to fully exploit the benefits of ML while considering domain-specific aspects relevant to the social and health sciences, and hopefully contribute to the acceleration of the uptake of ML applications to advance both basic and applied social and health sciences research.

Existing neural network methods require point coordinates and corresponding normal vectors to learn the implicit level sets of the shape. Normal vectors are often not provided as raw data, therefore, approximation and reorientation are required as pre-processing stages, both of which can introduce noise. In this paper, we propose a divergence guided shape representation learning approach that does not require normal vectors as input. We show that incorporating a soft constraint on the divergence of the distance function favours smooth solutions that reliably orients gradients to match the unknown normal at each point, in some cases even better than approaches that use ground truth normal vectors directly. Additionally, we introduce a novel geometric initialization method for sinusoidal shape representation networks that further improves convergence to the desired solution. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of surface reconstruction and show state-of-the-art performance compared to other unoriented methods and on-par performance compared to oriented methods.

We consider several ImageNet architectures, InceptionV3, VGG19 and ResNet50, as well as several strong attacks. We find that attacks can have different effects at pixel level depending on classifier architecture.

    "abstract": "A better understanding of dispersion in natural streams requires knowledge of longitudinal dispersion coefficient(LDC). Various methods have been proposed for predictions of LDC. Those studies can be grouped into three types: analytical, statistical and ML-driven researches(Implicit and explicit). However, a comprehensive evaluation of them is still lacking. In this paper, we first present an in-depth analysis of those methods and find out their defects. This is carried out on an extensive database composed of 660 samples of hydraulic and channel properties worldwide. The reliability and representativeness of utilized data are enhanced through the deployment of the Subset Selection of Maximum Dissimilarity(SSMD) for testing set selection and the Inter Quartile Range(IQR) for removal of the outlier. The evaluation reveals the rank of those methods as: ML-driven method > the statistical method > the analytical method. Whereas implicit ML-driven methods are black-boxes in nature, explicit ML-driven methods have more potential in prediction of LDC. Besides, overfitting is a universal problem in existing models. Those models also suffer from a fixed parameter combination. To establish an interpretable model for LDC prediction with higher performance, we then design a novel symbolic regression method called evolutionary symbolic regression network(ESRN). It is a combination of genetic algorithms and neural networks. Strategies are introduced to avoid overfitting and explore more parameter combinations. Results show that the ESRN model has superiorities over other existing symbolic models in performance. The proposed model is suitable for practical engineering problems due to its advantage in low requirement of parameters (only w and U* are required). It can provide convincing solutions for situations where the field test cannot be carried out or limited field information can be obtained. ",

The fact is that there exist low-quality annotations with label noise, which leads to suboptimal performance of learned models. Two prominent directions for segmentation learning with noisy labels include pixel-wise noise robust training and image-level noise robust training. In this work, we propose a novel framework to address segmenting with noisy labels by distilling effective supervision information from both pixel and image levels. In particular, we explicitly estimate the uncertainty of every pixel as pixel-wise noise estimation, and propose pixel-wise robust learning by using both the original labels and pseudo labels. Furthermore, we present an image-level robust learning method to accommodate more information as the complements to pixel-level learning. We conduct extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world noisy datasets.

    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of boundary conditions is crucial in computational physics. The ever increasing use of neural networks as surrogates for physics-related problems calls for an improved understanding of boundary condition treatment, and its influence on the network accuracy. In this paper, several strategies to impose boundary conditions (namely padding, improved spatial context, and explicit encoding of physical boundaries) are investigated in the context of fully convolutional networks applied to recurrent tasks. These strategies are evaluated on two spatio-temporal evolving problems modeled by partial differential equations: the 2D propagation of acoustic waves (hyperbolic PDE) and the heat equation (parabolic PDE). Results reveal a high sensitivity of both accuracy and stability on the boundary implementation in such recurrent tasks. It is then demonstrated that the choice of the optimal padding strategy is directly linked to the data semantics. Furthermore, the inclusion of additional input spatial context or explicit physics-based rules allows a better handling of boundaries in particular for large number of recurrences, resulting in more robust and stable neural networks, while facilitating the design and versatility of such networks.

    "abstract": "Many scientific datasets are compositional in nature. Important examples include species abundances in ecology, rock compositions in geology, topic compositions in large-scale text corpora, and sequencing count data in molecular biology. Here, we provide a causal view on compositional data in an instrumental variable setting where the composition acts as the cause. Throughout, we pay particular attention to the interpretation of compositional causes from the viewpoint of interventions and crisply articulate potential pitfalls for practitioners. Focusing on modern high-dimensional microbiome sequencing data as a timely illustrative use case, our analysis first reveals that popular one-dimensional information-theoretic summary statistics, such as diversity and richness, may be insufficient for drawing causal conclusions from ecological data. Instead, we advocate for multivariate alternatives using statistical data transformations and regression techniques that take the special structure of the compositional sample space into account. In a comparative analysis on synthetic and semi-synthetic data we show the advantages and limitations of our proposal. We posit that our framework may provide a useful starting point for cause-effect estimation in the context of compositional data. ",

    "abstract": "Aquatic organisms can use hydrodynamic cues to navigate, find their preys and escape from predators. We consider a model of two competing microswimmers engaged in a pursue-evasion task while immersed in a low-Reynolds-number environment. The players have limited abilities: they can only sense hydrodynamic disturbances, which provide some cue about the opponent's position, and perform simple manoeuvres. The goal of the pursuer is to capturethe evader in the shortest possible time. Conversely the evader aims at deferring capture as much as possible. We show that by means of Reinforcement Learning the players find efficient and physically explainable strategies which non-trivially exploit the hydrodynamic environment. This Letter offers a proof-of-concept for the use of Reinforcement Learning to discover prey-predator strategies in aquatic environments, with potential applications to underwater robotics. ",

    "abstract": "A neural network is essentially a high-dimensional complex mapping model by adjusting network weights for feature fitting. However, the spectral bias in network training leads to unbearable training epochs for fitting the high-frequency components in broadband signals. To improve the fitting efficiency of high-frequency components, the PhaseDNN was proposed recently by combining complex frequency band extraction and frequency shift techniques [Cai et al. SIAM J. SCI. COMPUT. 42, A3285 (2020)]. Our paper is devoted to an alternative candidate for fitting complex signals with high-frequency components. Here, a parallel frequency function-deep neural network (PFF-DNN) is proposed to suppress computational overhead while ensuring fitting accuracy by utilizing fast Fourier analysis of broadband signals and the spectral bias nature of neural networks. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PFF-DNN method are verified based on detailed numerical experiments for six typical broadband signals. ",

    "abstract": "An important knowledge dimension of science and technology is the extent to which their development is cumulative, that is, the extent to which later findings build on earlier ones. Cumulative knowledge structures can be studied using a network approach, in which nodes represent findings and links represent knowledge flows. Of particular interest to those studies is the notion of network paths and path length. Starting from the Price model of network growth, we derive an exact solution for the path length distribution of all unique paths from a given initial node to each node in the network. We study the relative importance of the average in-degree and cumulative advantage effect and implement a generalization where the in-degree depends on the number of nodes. The cumulative advantage effect is found to fundamentally slow down path length growth. As the collection of all unique paths may contain many redundancies, we additionally consider the subset of the longest paths to each node in the network. As this case is more complicated, we only approximate the longest path length distribution in a simple context. Where the number of all unique paths of a given length grows unbounded, the number of longest paths of a given length converges to a finite limit, which depends exponentially on the given path length. Fundamental network properties and dynamics therefore characteristically shape cumulative structures in those networks, and should therefore be taken into account when studying those structures. ",

Our main theorem generalizes the known estimate that a rectangular grid graph R with width w(R) and height h(R) has routing number rt(R) in O(w(R)+h(R)). We show that for the subgraph P of the infinite square lattice enclosed by any convex polygon, its routing number rt(P) is in O(w(P)+h(P)). ",
