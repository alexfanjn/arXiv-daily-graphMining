    "abstract": "Neural cellular automata are a recent model used to model biological phenomena emerging from multicellular organisms. In these models, artificial neural networks are used as update rules for cellular automata. They are end-to-end differentiable systems where the parameters of the neural network can be optimized to achieve a particular task. In this work, we used them to control a cart-pole agent. The observations of the environment are transmitted in inputs cells, while the values of output cells are used as readout of the system. We trained the model using deep-Q learning, where the states of the output cells were used as the q-value estimates to be optimized. We found that the computing abilities of the cellular automata were maintained over several hundreds of thousands of iterations, producing an emergent stable behavior in the environment it controls for thousands of steps. Moreover, the system demonstrated life-like phenomena such as a developmental phase, regeneration after damage, stability despite a noisy environment, and robustness to unseen disruption such as input deletion.

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks have been highly successful in image-based learning tasks due to their translation equivariance property. Recent work has generalized the traditional convolutional layer of a convolutional neural network to non-Euclidean spaces and shown group equivariance of the generalized convolution operation. In this paper, we present a novel higher order Volterra convolutional neural network (VolterraNet) for data defined as samples of functions on Riemannian homogeneous spaces. Analagous to the result for traditional convolutions, we prove that the Volterra functional convolutions are equivariant to the action of the isometry group admitted by the Riemannian homogeneous spaces, and under some restrictions, any non-linear equivariant function can be expressed as our homogeneous space Volterra convolution, generalizing the non-linear shift equivariant characterization of Volterra expansions in Euclidean space. We also prove that second order functional convolution operations can be represented as cascaded convolutions which leads to an efficient implementation. Beyond this, we also propose a dilated VolterraNet model. These advances lead to large parameter reductions relative to baseline non-Euclidean CNNs. To demonstrate the efficacy of the VolterraNet performance, we present several real data experiments involving classification tasks on spherical-MNIST, atomic energy, Shrec17 data sets, and group testing on diffusion MRI data. Performance comparisons to the state-of-the-art are also presented. ",

    "abstract": "3D model generation from single 2D RGB images is a challenging and actively researched computer vision task. Various techniques using conventional network architectures have been proposed for the same. However, the body of research work is limited and there are various issues like using inefficient 3D representation formats, weak 3D model generation backbones, inability to generate dense point clouds, dependence of post-processing for generation of dense point clouds, and dependence on silhouettes in RGB images. In this paper, a novel 2D RGB image to point cloud conversion technique is proposed, which improves the state of art in the field due to its efficient, robust and simple model by using the concept of parallelization in network architecture. It not only uses the efficient and rich 3D representation of point clouds, but also uses a novel and robust point cloud generation backbone in order to address the prevalent issues. This involves using a single-encoder multiple-decoder deep network architecture wherein each decoder generates certain fixed viewpoints. This is followed by fusing all the viewpoints to generate a dense point cloud. Various experiments are conducted on the technique and its performance is compared with those of other state of the art techniques and impressive gains in performance are demonstrated.

    "abstract": "The human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2), causing the COVID-19 disease, has continued to spread all over the world. It menacingly affects not only public health and global economics but also mental health and mood. While the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been widely studied, relatively fewer discussions about the sentimental reaction of the population have been available. In this article, we scrape COVID-19 related tweets on the microblogging platform, Twitter, and examine the tweets from Feb~24, 2020 to Oct~14, 2020 in four Canadian cities (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, and Calgary) and four U.S. cities (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Seattle). Applying the Vader and NRC approaches, we evaluate the sentiment intensity scores and visualize the information over different periods of the pandemic. Sentiment scores for the tweets concerning three anti-epidemic measures, masks, vaccine, and lockdown, are computed for comparisons. The results of four Canadian cities are compared with four cities in the United States. We study the causal relationships between the infected cases, the tweet activities, and the sentiment scores of COVID-19 related tweets, by integrating the echo state network method with convergent cross-mapping. Our analysis shows that public sentiments regarding COVID-19 vary in different time periods and locations. In general, people have a positive mood about COVID-19 and masks, but negative in the topics of vaccine and lockdown. The causal inference shows that the sentiment influences people's activities on Twitter, which is also correlated to the daily number of infections. ",

Besides the question of finding an optimal selection of winning bids, the question of how to share the obtained profit is of high importance. The egalitarian allocation is a well-known solution concept of profit sharing games which tries to distribute profit among players in a most equal way while respecting individual contributions to the obtained profit. Given a set of winning bids, we construct a special network graph and show that every flow in said graph corresponds to a core payment. Furthermore, we show that the egalitarian allocation can be characterized as an almost equal maximum flow which is a maximum flow with the additional property that the difference of flow value on given edge sets is bounded by a constant. With this, we are able to compute the egalitarian allocation in polynomial time. ",

However, a graph convolution can only cover a localized region, and cannot capture long-range interactions of atoms. This behavior is contrary to theoretical interatomic potentials, which is a fundamental limitation of the spatial based GNNs. In this work, we propose a novel attention-based framework for molecular property prediction tasks. We represent a molecular conformation as a discrete atomic sequence combined by atom-atom distance attributes, named Geometry-aware Transformer (GeoT). In particular, we adopt a Transformer architecture, which has been widely used for sequential data. Our proposed model trains sequential representations of molecular graphs based on globally constructed attentions, maintaining all spatial arrangements of atom pairs. Our method does not suffer from cost intensive computations, such as angle calculations. The experimental results on several public benchmarks and visualization maps verified that keeping the long-range interatomic attributes can significantly improve the model predictability. ",

Earlier people use to verbally deliver hate speeches but now with the expansion of technology, some people are deliberately using social media platforms to spread hate by posting, sharing, commenting, etc. Whether it is Christchurch mosque shootings or hate crimes against Asians in west, it has been observed that the convicts are very much influenced from hate text present online. Even though AI systems are in place to flag such text but one of the key challenges is to reduce the false positive rate (marking non hate as hate), so that these systems can detect hate speech without undermining the freedom of expression. In this paper, we use ETHOS hate speech detection dataset and analyze the performance of hate speech detection classifier by replacing or integrating the word embeddings (fastText (FT), GloVe (GV) or FT + GV) with static BERT embeddings (BE). With the extensive experimental trails it is observed that the neural network performed better with static BE compared to using FT, GV or FT + GV as word embeddings. In comparison to fine-tuned BERT, one metric that significantly improved is specificity. ",

The deployment of software-controlled accounts (e.g., social bots) has proven to be one of the most effective enablers for that purpose, and tools for their detection have been developed and widely adopted. However, the way to analyze these accounts and measure their impact is heterogeneous in the literature, where each case study performs unique measurements. To unify these efforts, we propose a common framework to analyze the interference of social bots in Twitter. The methodology compares the non-authentic actors with the rest of users from different perspectives, thus building objective metrics to measure their actual impact. We validate the framework by applying it to a dataset of Twitter iterations dated in the weeks preceding the 2019 Spanish general election. In this sense, we check that our framework facilitates the quantitative evaluation of unauthentic groups, particularly discovering that social bots changed the natural dynamics of the network in these days, but did not have a significant impact. We also consider this methodology as a practical tool for the qualitative interpretation of experimental results, particularly suggesting within the aforementioned electoral context that semi-automated accounts are potentially more threatening than fully automated ones.

The main problem of interest is recovering the causal structure over the latent variables while allowing for general, potentially nonlinear dependence between the variables. In many practical problems, the dependence between raw observations (e.g. pixels in an image) is much less relevant than the dependence between certain high-level, latent features (e.g. concepts or objects), and this is the setting of interest. We provide conditions under which both the latent representations and the underlying latent causal model are identifiable by a reduction to a mixture oracle. The proof is constructive, and leads to several algorithms for explicitly reconstructing the full graphical model. We discuss efficient algorithms and provide experiments illustrating the algorithms in practice. ",

We apply APC using either a GRU or GRU-D encoder on two real-world datasets, and show that applying one-step-ahead prediction with APC improves the classification results in all settings. In fact, by applying GRU-D - APC, we achieve state-of-the-art AUPRC results on the Physionet benchmark. ",

These networks are often trained end-to-end to directly reconstruct an image from a noisy or corrupted measurement of that image. To achieve state-of-the-art performance, training on large and diverse sets of images is considered critical. However, it is often difficult and/or expensive to collect large amounts of training images. Inspired by the success of Data Augmentation (DA) for classification problems, in this paper, we propose a pipeline for data augmentation for accelerated MRI reconstruction and study its effectiveness at reducing the required training data in a variety of settings. Our DA pipeline, MRAugment, is specifically designed to utilize the invariances present in medical imaging measurements as naive DA strategies that neglect the physics of the problem fail. Through extensive studies on multiple datasets we demonstrate that in the low-data regime DA prevents overfitting and can match or even surpass the state of the art while using significantly fewer training data, whereas in the high-data regime it has diminishing returns. Furthermore, our findings show that DA can improve the robustness of the model against various shifts in the test distribution. ",

Together with an attention map of the CNN's last layer, our method can not only quantify stochastic EP but also produce the spatiotemporal pattern of the EP (dissipation map). We show that our method accurately measures the EP and creates a dissipation map in two nonequilibrium systems, the bead-spring model and a network of elastic filaments. We further confirm high performance even with noisy, low spatial resolution data, and partially observed situations. Our method will provide a practical way to obtain dissipation maps and ultimately contribute to uncovering the nonequilibrium nature of complex systems. ",

    "abstract": "Gene expression datasets consist of thousand of genes with relatively small samplesizes (i.e. are large-$p$-small-$n$). Moreover, dependencies of various orders co-exist in the datasets. In the Undirected probabilistic Graphical Model (UGM) framework the Glasso algorithm has been proposed to deal with high dimensional micro-array datasets forcing sparsity. Also, modifications of the default Glasso algorithm are developed to overcome the problem of complex interaction structure. In this work we advocate the use of a simple score-based Hill Climbing algorithm (HC) that learns Gaussian Bayesian Networks (BNs) leaning on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). We compare HC with Glasso and its modifications in the UGM framework on their capability to reconstruct GRNs from micro-array data belonging to the Escherichia Coli genome. We benefit from the analytical properties of the Joint Probability Density (JPD) function on which both directed and undirected PGMs build to convert DAGs to UGMs. We conclude that dependencies in complex data are learned best by the HC algorithm, presenting them most accurately and efficiently, simultaneously modelling strong local and weaker but significant global connections coexisting in the gene expression dataset. The HC algorithm adapts intrinsically to the complex dependency structure of the dataset, without forcing a specific structure in advance. On the contrary, Glasso and modifications model unnecessary dependencies at the expense of the probabilistic information in the network and of a structural bias in the JPD function that can only be relieved including many parameters.

The updating mode then determines how the configuration of the network evolves over time. Many of updating modes from the literature, including synchronous and asynchronous modes, can be defined as the composition of elementary deterministic configuration updates, i.e., by functions mapping configurations of the network. Nevertheless, alternative dynamics have been introduced using ad-hoc auxiliary objects, such as that resulting from binary projections of Memory Boolean networks, or that resulting from additional pseudo-states for Most Permissive Boolean networks. One may wonder whether these latter dynamics can still be classified as updating modes of finite Boolean networks, or belong to a different class of dynamical systems. In this paper, we study the extension of updating modes to the composition of non-deterministic updates, i.e., mapping sets of finite configurations. We show that the above dynamics can be expressed in this framework, enabling a better understanding of them as updating modes of Boolean networks. More generally, we argue that non-deterministic updates pave the way to a unifying framework for expressing complex updating modes, some of them enabling transitions that cannot be computed with elementary and non-elementary deterministic updates.

Theory and Methods: The predictable components sampled across the echo dimension in a multi-echo GRE sequence are recovered by rank minimizing a Hankel matrix formed using the complex exponential of the background suppressed phase. To estimate the single frequency component that relates to the susceptibility induced field, it is required to maintain consistency with the measured phase after background suppression, penalized by a unity rank approximation (URA) prior. This is formulated as an optimization problem, implemented using the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). Results: With in vivo multi-echo GRE data, the magnitude susceptibility weighted image (SWI) reconstructed using URA prior shows additional venous structures that are obscured due to phase dispersion and noise in regions subject to remnant non-local field variations. The performance is compared with the susceptibility map weighted imaging (SMWI) and the standard SWI. It is also shown using numerical simulation that quantitative susceptibility map (QSM) computed from the reconstructed phase exhibits reduced artifacts and quantification error. In vivo experiments reveal iron depositions in insular, motor cortex and superior frontal gyrus that are not identified in standard QSM. Conclusion: URA processed GRE phase is less sensitive to imperfections in the phase pre-processing techniques, and thereby enable robust estimation of SWI and QSM. ",
