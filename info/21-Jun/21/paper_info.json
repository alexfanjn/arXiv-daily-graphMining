    "title": "Adversarial Detection Avoidance Attacks: Evaluating the robustness of  perceptual hashing-based client-side scanning",
    "abstract": "End-to-end encryption (E2EE) by messaging platforms enable people to securely and privately communicate with one another. Its widespread adoption however raised concerns that illegal content might now be shared undetected. Following the global pushback against key escrow systems, client-side scanning based on perceptual hashing has been recently proposed by governments and researchers to detect illegal content in E2EE communications. We here propose the first framework to evaluate the robustness of perceptual hashing-based client-side scanning to detection avoidance attacks and show current systems to not be robust. More specifically, we propose three adversarial attacks -- a general black-box attack and two white-box attacks for discrete cosine-based-based algorithms -- against perceptual hashing algorithms. In a large-scale evaluation, we show perceptual hashing-based client-side scanning mechanisms to be highly vulnerable to detection avoidance attacks in a black-box setting, with more than 99.9% of images successfully attacked while preserving the content of the image. We furthermore show our attack to generate diverse perturbations, strongly suggesting that straightforward mitigation strategies would be ineffective. Finally, we show that the larger thresholds necessary to make the attack harder would probably require more than one billion images to be flagged and decrypted daily, raising strong privacy concerns.Taken together, our results shed serious doubts on the robustness of perceptual hashing-based client-side scanning mechanisms currently proposed by governments, organizations, and researchers around the world.

    "title": "Meta-control of social learning strategies",
    "abstract": "Social learning, copying other's behavior without actual experience, offers a cost-effective means of knowledge acquisition. However, it raises the fundamental question of which individuals have reliable information: successful individuals versus the majority. The former and the latter are known respectively as success-based and conformist social learning strategies. We show here that while the success-based strategy fully exploits the benign environment of low uncertainly, it fails in uncertain environments. On the other hand, the conformist strategy can effectively mitigate this adverse effect. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that meta-control of individual and social learning strategies provides effective and sample-efficient learning in volatile and uncertain environments. Simulations on a set of environments with various levels of volatility and uncertainty confirmed our hypothesis. The results imply that meta-control of social learning affords agents the leverage to resolve environmental uncertainty with minimal exploration cost, by exploiting others' learning as an external knowledge base.

We continue to investigate the use of neural networks to approximate matrix elements for high-multiplicity scattering processes. We focus on the case of loop-induced diphoton production through gluon fusion and develop a realistic simulation method that can be applied to hadron collider observables. Neural networks are trained using the one-loop amplitudes implemented in the NJet C++ library and interfaced to the Sherpa Monte Carlo event generator where we perform a detailed study for $2\\to3$ and $2\\to4$ scattering problems. We also consider how the trained networks perform when varying the kinematic cuts effecting the phase space and the reliability of the neural network simulations. ",

    "abstract": "In this work we address the problem of landmark-based segmentation for anatomical structures. We propose HybridGNet, an encoder-decoder neural architecture which combines standard convolutions for image feature encoding, with graph convolutional neural networks to decode plausible representations of anatomical structures. We benchmark the proposed architecture considering other standard landmark and pixel-based models for anatomical segmentation in chest x-ray images, and found that HybridGNet is more robust to image occlusions. We also show that it can be used to construct landmark-based segmentations from pixel level annotations. Our experimental results suggest that HybridGNet produces accurate and anatomically plausible landmark-based segmentations, by naturally incorporating shape constraints within the decoding process via spectral convolutions.

    "abstract": "Fitting network models to neural activity is becoming an important tool in neuroscience. A popular approach is to model a brain area with a probabilistic recurrent spiking network whose parameters maximize the likelihood of the recorded activity. Although this is widely used, we show that the resulting model does not produce realistic neural activity and wrongly estimates the connectivity matrix when neurons that are not recorded have a substantial impact on the recorded network. To correct for this, we suggest to augment the log-likelihood with terms that measure the dissimilarity between simulated and recorded activity. This dissimilarity is defined via summary statistics commonly used in neuroscience, and the optimization is efficient because it relies on back-propagation through the stochastically simulated spike trains. We analyze this method theoretically and show empirically that it generates more realistic activity statistics and recovers the connectivity matrix better than other methods. ",

    "title": "Systematic comparison of graph embedding methods in practical tasks",
    "abstract": "Network embedding techniques aim at representing structural properties of graphs in geometric space. Those representations are considered useful in downstream tasks such as link prediction and clustering. However, the number of graph embedding methods available on the market is large, and practitioners face the non-trivial choice of selecting the proper approach for a given application. The present work attempts to close this gap of knowledge through a systematic comparison of eleven different methods for graph embedding. We consider methods for embedding networks in the hyperbolic and Euclidean metric spaces, as well as non-metric community-based embedding methods. We apply these methods to embed more than one hundred real-world and synthetic networks. Three common downstream tasks -- mapping accuracy, greedy routing, and link prediction -- are considered to evaluate the quality of the various embedding methods. Our results show that some Euclidean embedding methods excel in greedy routing. As for link prediction, community-based and hyperbolic embedding methods yield overall performance superior than that of Euclidean-space-based approaches. We compare the running time for different methods and further analyze the impact of different network characteristics such as degree distribution, modularity, and clustering coefficients on the quality of the different embedding methods. We release our evaluation framework to provide a standardized benchmark for arbitrary embedding methods. ",
