    "title": "CONDA: a CONtextual Dual-Annotated dataset for in-game toxicity  understanding and detection",
    "abstract": "Traditional toxicity detection models have focused on the single utterance level without deeper understanding of context. We introduce CONDA, a new dataset for in-game toxic language detection enabling joint intent classification and slot filling analysis, which is the core task of Natural Language Understanding (NLU). The dataset consists of 45K utterances from 12K conversations from the chat logs of 1.9K completed Dota 2 matches. We propose a robust dual semantic-level toxicity framework, which handles utterance and token-level patterns, and rich contextual chatting history. Accompanying the dataset is a thorough in-game toxicity analysis, which provides comprehensive understanding of context at utterance, token, and dual levels. Inspired by NLU, we also apply its metrics to the toxicity detection tasks for assessing toxicity and game-specific aspects. We evaluate strong NLU models on CONDA, providing fine-grained results for different intent classes and slot classes. Furthermore, we examine the coverage of toxicity nature in our dataset by comparing it with other toxicity datasets. ",

    "title": "Projection-based resolved interface mixed-dimension method for embedded  tubular network systems",
    "abstract": "We present a flexible discretization technique for computational models of thin tubular networks embedded in a bulk domain, for example a porous medium. These systems occur in the simulation of fluid flow in vascularized biological tissue, root water and nutrient uptake in soil, hydrological or petroleum wells in rock formations, or heat transport in micro-cooling devices. The key processes, such as heat and mass transfer, are usually dominated by the exchange between the network system and the embedding domain. By explicitly resolving the interface between these domains with the computational mesh, we can accurately describe these processes. The network is efficiently described by a network of line segments. Coupling terms are evaluated by projection of the interface variables. The new method is naturally applicable for nonlinear and time-dependent problems and can therefore be used as a reference method in the development of novel implicit interface 1D-3D methods and in the design of verification benchmarks for embedded tubular network methods. Implicit interface, not resolving the bulk-network interface explicitly have proven to be very efficient but have only been mathematically analyzed for linear elliptic problems so far. Using two application scenarios, fluid perfusion of vascularized tissue and root water uptake from soil, we investigate the effect of some common modeling assumptions of implicit interface methods numerically.

    "title": "Scale-invariant scale-channel networks: Deep networks that generalise to  previously unseen scales",
    "abstract": "The ability to handle large scale variations is crucial for many real world visual tasks. A straightforward approach for handling scale in a deep network is to process an image at several scales simultaneously in a set of scale channels. Scale invariance can then, in principle, be achieved by using weight sharing between the scale channels together with max or average pooling over the outputs from the scale channels. The ability of such scale channel networks to generalise to scales not present in the training set over significant scale ranges has, however, not previously been explored. In this paper, we present a systematic study of this methodology by implementing different types of scale channel networks and evaluating their ability to generalise to previously unseen scales. We develop a formalism for analysing the covariance and invariance properties of scale channel networks, and explore how different design choices, unique to scaling transformations, affect the overall performance of scale channel networks. We first show that two previously proposed scale channel network designs do not generalise well to scales not present in the training set. We explain theoretically and demonstrate experimentally why generalisation fails in these cases. We then propose a new type of foveated scale channel architecture}, where the scale channels process increasingly larger parts of the image with decreasing resolution. This new type of scale channel network is shown to generalise extremely well, provided sufficient image resolution and the absence of boundary effects. Our proposed FovMax and FovAvg networks perform almost identically over a scale range of 8, also when training on single scale training data, and do also give improved performance when learning from datasets with large scale variations in the small sample regime.

    "abstract": "Context: Decentralized applications on blockchain platforms are realized through smart contracts. However, participants who lack programming knowledge often have difficulties reading the smart contract source codes, which leads to potential security risks and barriers to participation. Objective: Our objective is to translate the smart contract source codes into natural language descriptions to help people better understand, operate, and learn smart contracts. Method: This paper proposes an automated translation tool for Solidity smart contracts, termed SolcTrans, based on an abstract syntax tree and formal grammar. We have investigated 3,000 smart contracts and determined the part of speeches of corresponding blockchain terms. Among them, we further filtered out contract snippets without detailed comments and left 811 snippets to evaluate the translation quality of SolcTrans. Results: Experimental results show that even with a small corpus, SolcTrans can achieve similar performance to the state-of-the-art code comments generation models for other programming languages. In addition, SolcTrans has consistent performance when dealing with code snippets with different lengths and gas consumption. Conclusion: SolcTrans can correctly interpret Solidity codes and automatically convert them into comprehensible English text. We will release our tool and dataset for supporting reproduction and further studies in related fields. ",
