    "title": "DNS attack mitigation Using OpenStack Isolation",
    "abstract": "The Domain Name System (DNS) is essential for the Internet, giving a mechanism to resolve hostnames into Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS is known as the world's largest distributed database that manages hostnames and Internet Protocol. By having the DNS, only simple names that can be easily memorized will be used and then the domain name system will map it into the numeric Internet Protocol addresses that are used by computers to communicate. This research aims to propose a model for the development of a private cloud infrastructure to host DNS. The cloud infrastructure will be created using the OpenStack software platform where each server will be hosted separately in a different virtual machine. Virtual network architecture will be created using the Software Defined Networking (SDN) approach and it will be secured using Firewall as a Service (FWaaS). By hosting DNS in private cloud infrastructure, the DNS servers will be out of reach by attackers which will prevent DNS attacks. Besides, available research had proven that the cloud is the best choice for DNS. A prototype had been implemented and evaluated for its efficiencies. The findings from the evaluation carried out shown a positive result. ",

    "title": "Does class size matter? An in-depth assessment of the effect of class  size in software defect prediction",
    "abstract": "In the past 20 years, defect prediction studies have generally acknowledged the effect of class size on software prediction performance. To quantify the relationship between object-oriented (OO) metrics and defects, modelling has to take into account the direct, and potentially indirect, effects of class size on defects. However, some studies have shown that size cannot be simply controlled or ignored, when building prediction models. As such, there remains a question whether, and when, to control for class size. This study provides a new in-depth examination of the impact of class size on the relationship between OO metrics and software defects or defect-proneness. We assess the impact of class size on the number of defects and defect-proneness in software systems by employing a regression-based mediation (with bootstrapping) and moderation analysis to investigate the direct and indirect effect of class size in count and binary defect prediction. Our results show that the size effect is not always significant for all metrics. Of the seven OO metrics we investigated, size consistently has significant mediation impact only on the relationship between Coupling Between Objects (CBO) and defects/defect-proneness, and a potential moderation impact on the relationship between Fan-out and defects/defect-proneness. Based on our results we make three recommendations. One, we encourage researchers and practitioners to examine the impact of class size for the specific data they have in hand and through the use of the proposed statistical mediation/moderation procedures. Two, we encourage empirical studies to investigate the indirect effect of possible additional variables in their models when relevant. Three, the statistical procedures adopted in this study could be used in other empirical software engineering research to investigate the influence of potential mediators/moderators. ",

    "abstract": "Graph is an usual representation of relational data, which are ubiquitous in manydomains such as molecules, biological and social networks. A popular approach to learningwith graph structured data is to make use of graph kernels, which measure the similaritybetween graphs and are plugged into a kernel machine such as a support vector machine.Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) based graph kernels, which employ WL labeling scheme to extract subtree patterns and perform node embedding, are demonstrated to achieve great performance while being efficiently computable. However, one of the main drawbacks of ageneral kernel is the decoupling of kernel construction and learning process. For moleculargraphs, usual kernels such as WL subtree, based on substructures of the molecules, consider all available substructures having the same importance, which might not be suitable inpractice. In this paper, we propose a method to learn the weights of subtree patterns in the framework of WWL kernels, the state of the art method for graph classification task [14]. To overcome the computational issue on large scale data sets, we present an efficient learning algorithm and also derive a generalization gap bound to show its convergence. Finally, through experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for learning the weights of subtree patterns. ",

However, these smart applications have been a prime target of adversaries for stealing sensitive data. It poses a crucial threat to users' identity security, financial security, or even life security. Research communities and industries have proposed many Information Flow Control (IFC) techniques for data leakage detection and prevention, including secure modeling, type system, static analysis, dynamic analysis, \\textit{etc}. According to the application's development life cycle, although most attacks are conducted during the application's execution phase, data leakage vulnerabilities have been introduced since the design phase. With a focus on lifecycle protection, this survey reviews the recent representative works adopted in different phases. We propose an information flow based defensive chain, which provides a new framework to systematically understand various IFC techniques for data leakage detection and prevention in Mobile and IoT applications. In line with the phases of the application life cycle, each reviewed work is comprehensively studied in terms of technique, performance, and limitation. Research challenges and future directions are also pointed out by consideration of the integrity of the defensive chain. ",

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic neural network processors, in the form of compute-in-memory crossbar arrays of memristors, or in the form of subthreshold analog and mixed-signal ASICs, promise enormous advantages in compute density and energy efficiency for NN-based ML tasks. However, these technologies are prone to computational non-idealities, due to process variation and intrinsic device physics. This degrades the task performance of networks deployed to the processor, by introducing parameter noise into the deployed model. While it is possible to calibrate each device, or train networks individually for each processor, these approaches are expensive and impractical for commercial deployment. Alternative methods are therefore needed to train networks that are inherently robust against parameter variation, as a consequence of network architecture and parameters. We present a new adversarial network optimisation algorithm that attacks network parameters during training, and promotes robust performance during inference in the face of parameter variation. Our approach introduces a regularization term penalising the susceptibility of a network to weight perturbation. We compare against previous approaches for producing parameter insensitivity such as dropout, weight smoothing and introducing parameter noise during training. We show that our approach produces models that are more robust to targeted parameter variation, and equally robust to random parameter variation. Our approach finds minima in flatter locations in the weight-loss landscape compared with other approaches, highlighting that the networks found by our technique are less sensitive to parameter perturbation. Our work provides an approach to deploy neural network architectures to inference devices that suffer from computational non-idealities, with minimal loss of performance. ... ",

Next, we focus on a specific SDG, known as The Werewolf, and study if and how various forms of communication influence the outcome of the game. Experimental results show that introducing a communication signal greatly increases the winning chances of a class of players.

Available constant complexity techniques typically solve a relaxed version of the problem, deeply relying on very specific probability distributions and/or some very precise additional knowledge. We consider a totally different approach that leverages the theoretical asymptotic properties of optimal solutions to derive a new scalable approximate algorithm with near optimal performance that runs~in~$\\mathcal{O}(1)$, adapted to even more complex Markovian settings.

We propose a novel loss function exploiting geometric knowledge of lanes in Hough space, where a lane can be identified as a local maximum. By splitting lanes into separate channels, we can localize each lane via simple global max-pooling. The location of the maximum encodes the layout of a lane, while the intensity indicates the the probability of a lane being present. Maximizing the log-probability of the maximal bins helps neural networks find lanes without labels. On the CULane and TuSimple datasets, we show that the proposed Hough Transform loss improves performance significantly by learning from large amounts of unlabelled images. ",

Traditional population based evolutionary methods have homogeneous populations where all solutions use the same representation. If different representations are to be considered, different runs are required to investigate the relative performance. In this paper, we illustrate the use of a population based evolutionary method, Fresa, inspired by the propagation of Strawberry plants, which allows for multiple representations to co-exist in the population. Fresa is implemented in the Julia language. Julia provides dynamic typing and multiple dispatch. In multiple dispatch, the function invoked is determined, dynamically at run time, by the types of the arguments passed to it. This enables a generic implementation of key steps in the plant propagation algorithm which allows for a heterogeneous population. The search procedure then leads to a competition between representations automatically. A simple case study from the design of operating conditions for a batch reactor system is used to illustrate heterogeneous population based search. ",

This is the first constant fraction improvement over the trivial bound that codes tolerating $N/2$ adversarial deletions must have rate going to 0 asymptotically.

As an immediate corollary, we show that $q$-ary codes tolerating a fraction $1-(1+2\\delta)/q$ of adversarial deletions must also have rate approaching 0. Our techniques include string regularity arguments and a structural lemma that classifies binary strings by their oscillation patterns. Leveraging these tools, we find in any large code two strings with similar oscillation patterns, which is exploited to find a long common subsequence. ",

Recently, transformer has shown superior performance over convolution with more feature interactions. Yet its ap-plications in LDCT denoising have not been fully cultivated. Here, we propose a convolution-free T2T vision transformer-based Encoder-decoder Dilation net-work (TED-net) to enrich the family of LDCT denoising algorithms. The model is free of convolution blocks and consists of a symmetric encoder-decoder block with sole transformer.

Recent studies confirmed that quantum neural networks (QNNs) have the ability to achieve this goal on specific datasets. With this regard, it is of great importance to understand whether these advantages are still preserved on real-world tasks. Through systematic numerical experiments, we empirically observe that current QNNs fail to provide any benefit over classical learning models. Concretely, our results deliver two key messages. First, QNNs suffer from the severely limited effective model capacity, which incurs poor generalization on real-world datasets. Second, the trainability of QNNs is insensitive to regularization techniques, which sharply contrasts with the classical scenario. These empirical results force us to rethink the role of current QNNs and to design novel protocols for solving real-world problems with quantum advantages. ",

Computational models provide an alternative framework within which one can study model systems where ground-truth can be measured and interfered with. These models act as a hypothesis generation framework that would in turn guide experimentation. Furthermore, the ability to intervene as we please, allows us to conduct in-depth analysis of these models in a way that cannot be performed in natural systems.

Anomalies are localized using the voxel-wise probability predicted by our model for the restored image.

We solve the problem for some common versions of these moments, including the mean state and versions of the second moment which induce discord, repel from a certain state, or encourage convergence.
