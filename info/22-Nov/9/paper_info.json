    "title": "Network Diffusion Model Reveals Recovery Multipliers and Heterogeneous  Spatial Effects in Post-Disaster Community Recovery",
    "abstract": "Community recovery from hazards and crises occurs through various diffusion processes within social and spatial networks of communities. Existing knowledge regarding the diffusion of recovery in community socio-spatial networks, however, is rather limited. To bridge this gap, in this study, we created a network diffusion model to characterize the unfolding of population activity recovery in spatial networks of communities. Using data related to population activity recovery durations calculated from location-based data in the context of 2017 Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area, we parameterized the threshold-based network diffusion model and evaluated the extent of homogeneity in spatial effects. Then we implemented the network diffusion model along with the genetic algorithm to simulate and identify recovery multipliers. The results show that the spatial effects of recovery are rather heterogeneous across spatial areas; some spatial areas demonstrate a greater spatial effect (spatial interdependence) in their recovery compared with others. Also, the results show that low-income areas demonstrate a greater spatial effect in their recovery. The greater spatial effects in recovery of low-income areas imply more reliance on resources and facilities of neighboring areas and also explain the existence of slow recovery hotspots in areas where socially vulnerable populations reside. Also, the results show that low-income and minority areas are community recovery multipliers; the faster the recovery of these recovery multipliers; the faster the recovery of the entire community. Hence, prioritizing these areas for recovery resource allocation could expedite the recovery of the overall community and promote recovery equality and equity. ",

    "title": "FED-CD: Federated Causal Discovery from Interventional and Observational  Data",
    "abstract": "Causal discovery, the inference of causal relations from data, is a core task of fundamental importance in all scientific domains, and several new machine learning methods for addressing the causal discovery problem have been proposed recently. However, existing machine learning methods for causal discovery typically require that the data used for inference is pooled and available in a centralized location. In many domains of high practical importance, such as in healthcare, data is only available at local data-generating entities (e.g. hospitals in the healthcare context), and cannot be shared across entities due to, among others, privacy and regulatory reasons. In this work, we address the problem of inferring causal structure - in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) - from a distributed data set that contains both observational and interventional data in a privacy-preserving manner by exchanging updates instead of samples. To this end, we introduce a new federated framework, FED-CD, that enables the discovery of global causal structures both when the set of intervened covariates is the same across decentralized entities, and when the set of intervened covariates are potentially disjoint. We perform a comprehensive experimental evaluation on synthetic data that demonstrates that FED-CD enables effective aggregation of decentralized data for causal discovery without direct sample sharing, even when the contributing distributed data sets cover disjoint sets of interventions. Effective methods for causal discovery in distributed data sets could significantly advance scientific discovery and knowledge sharing in important settings, for instance, healthcare, in which sharing of data across local sites is difficult or prohibited.

In this research, a total of 28 different model variations were examined to improve the accuracy of LULC maps. The experiments were carried out using Landsat 5/7 or Landsat 8 satellite images with the North American Land Change Monitoring System labels. The performance of various CNNs and extension combinations were assessed, where VGGNet with an output stride of 4, and modified U-Net architecture provided the best results. Additional expanded analysis of the generated LULC maps was also provided. Using a deep neural network, this work achieved 92.4% accuracy for 13 LULC classes within southern Manitoba representing a 15.8% improvement over published results for the NALCMS. Based on the large regions of interest, higher radiometric resolution of Landsat 8 data resulted in better overall accuracies (88.04%) compare to Landsat 5/7 (80.66%) for 16 LULC classes. This represents an 11.44% and 4.06% increase in overall accuracy compared to previously published NALCMS results, including larger land area and higher number of LULC classes incorporated into the models compared to other published LULC map automation methods.

The proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results on the SEED-VIG dataset and the SADT dataset. The accuracy of the drowsy class achieves 92% and 94% for 1-shot and 5-shot support samples in the SEED-VIG dataset, and 62% and 78% for 1-shot and 5-shot support samples in the SADT dataset. ",

Inspired by the Belief Propagation (BP), NSNet uses a novel graph neural network (GNN) to parameterize BP in the latent space, where its hidden representations maintain the same probabilistic interpretation as BP. NSNet can be flexibly configured to solve both SAT and #SAT problems by applying different learning objectives. For SAT, instead of directly predicting a satisfying assignment, NSNet performs marginal inference among all satisfying solutions, which we empirically find is more feasible for neural networks to learn. With the estimated marginals, a satisfying assignment can be efficiently generated by rounding and executing a stochastic local search. For #SAT, NSNet performs approximate model counting by learning the Bethe approximation of the partition function. Our evaluations show that NSNet achieves competitive results in terms of inference accuracy and time efficiency on multiple SAT and #SAT datasets. ",

Behavioral therapy is the first-line treatment for patients with TS, and it helps patients raise awareness about tic occurrence as well as develop tic inhibition strategies. However, the limited availability of therapists and the difficulties for in-home follow up work limits its effectiveness. An automatic tic detection system that is easy to deploy could alleviate the difficulties of home-therapy by providing feedback to the patients while exercising tic awareness. In this work, we propose a novel architecture (T-Net) for automatic tic detection and classification from untrimmed videos. T-Net combines temporal detection and segmentation and operates on features that are interpretable to a clinician. We compare T-Net to several state-of-the-art systems working on deep features extracted from the raw videos and T-Net achieves comparable performance in terms of average precision while relying on interpretable features needed in clinical practice.

Yet despite the plethora of research and open-source utilities that have accompanied its rise, with limited exceptions, differential privacy has failed to achieve widespread adoption in the enterprise domain. Our study aims to shed light on the fundamental causes underlying this academic-industrial utilization gap through detailed interviews of 24 privacy practitioners across 9 major companies. We analyze the results of our survey to provide key findings and suggestions for companies striving to improve privacy protection in their data workflows and highlight the necessary and missing requirements of existing differential privacy tools, with the goal of guiding researchers working towards the broader adoption of differential privacy. Our findings indicate that analysts suffer from lengthy bureaucratic processes for requesting access to sensitive data, yet once granted, only scarcely-enforced privacy policies stand between rogue practitioners and misuse of private information. We thus argue that differential privacy can significantly improve the processes of requesting and conducting data exploration across silos, and conclude that with a few of the improvements suggested herein, the practical use of differential privacy across the enterprise is within striking distance.

Specifically, we measure acoustic, phonetic, and word-level properties encoded in individual layers, using a lightweight analysis tool based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA). We find that these properties evolve across layers differently depending on the model, and the variations relate to the choice of pre-training objective. We further investigate the utility of our analyses for downstream tasks by comparing the property trends with performance on speech recognition and spoken language understanding tasks. We discover that CCA trends provide reliable guidance to choose layers of interest for downstream tasks and that single-layer performance often matches or improves upon using all layers, suggesting implications for more efficient use of pre-trained models.

    "abstract": "With the spread of tampered images, locating the tampered regions in digital images has drawn increasing attention. The existing image tampering localization methods, however, suffer from severe performance degradation when the tampered images are subjected to some post-processing, as the tampering traces would be distorted by the post-processing operations. The poor robustness against post-processing has become a bottleneck for the practical applications of image tampering localization techniques. In order to address this issue, this paper proposes a novel restoration-assisted framework for image tampering localization (ReLoc). The ReLoc framework mainly consists of an image restoration module and a tampering localization module. The key idea of ReLoc is to use the restoration module to recover a high-quality counterpart of the distorted tampered image, such that the distorted tampering traces can be re-enhanced, facilitating the tampering localization module to identify the tampered regions. To achieve this, the restoration module is optimized not only with the conventional constraints on image visual quality but also with a forensics-oriented objective function. Furthermore, the restoration module and the localization module are trained alternately, which can stabilize the training process and is beneficial for improving the performance. The proposed framework is evaluated by fighting against JPEG compression, the most commonly used post-processing. Extensive experimental results show that ReLoc can significantly improve the robustness against JPEG compression. The restoration module in a well-trained ReLoc model is transferable. Namely, it is still effective when being directly deployed with another tampering localization module. ",

Through the combination of (1) intrusion examples, (2) NIDS update rules, (3) attack threshold choices to trigger NIDS retraining requests, and (4) production environment with no prior knowledge of the nature of network traffic 40 scenarios were auto-generated to evaluate the ML ensemble NIDS comprising three tree-based models. Results show that under the model settings of an Update-ALL-NIDS rule (namely, retrain and update all the three models upon the same NIDS retraining request) the proposed ML ensemble NIDS produced the best results with nearly 100% detection performance throughout the simulation, exhibiting robustness in the complex dynamics of the simulated cyber-security scenario.

In this paper, we propose three Robust Manifold NTF algorithms to handle outliers by incorporating structural knowledge about the outliers. They first applies a half-quadratic optimization algorithm to transform the problem into a general weighted NTF where the weights are influenced by the outliers. Then, we introduce the correntropy induced metric, Huber function and Cauchy function for weights respectively, to handle the outliers.

We hypothesize that by introducing negative samples, a contrastive learning (CL) formulation could be beneficial in such scenarios. However, existing CL methods model KG triplets as binary objects of entities ignoring the relation-guided ternary propagation patterns and they are too generic, i.e., they ignore zero-shot, few-shot and synonymity problems that appear in OpenKGs. To address this, we propose TernaryCL, a CL framework based on ternary propagation patterns among head, relation and tail. TernaryCL designs Contrastive Entity and Contrastive Relation to mine ternary discriminative features with both negative entities and relations, introduces Contrastive Self to help zero- and few-shot entities learn discriminative features, Contrastive Synonym to model synonymous entities, and Contrastive Fusion to aggregate graph features from multiple paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of TernaryCL over state-of-the-art models. ",

It remains an open problem on whether the limited dialectical data can be used to improve the models trained in Arabic on its dialectal variants. First, we show that multilingual-BERT (mBERT) incrementally pretrained on Arabic monolingual data takes less training time and yields comparable accuracy when compared to our custom monolingual Arabic model and beat existing models (by an avg metric of +$6.41$). We then explore two continual pre-training methods-- (1) using small amounts of dialectical data for continual finetuning and (2) parallel Arabic to English data and a Translation Language Modeling loss function.

    "abstract": "We focus on causal discovery in the presence of measurement error in linear systems where the mixing matrix, i.e., the matrix indicating the independent exogenous noise terms pertaining to the observed variables, is identified up to permutation and scaling of the columns. We demonstrate a somewhat surprising connection between this problem and causal discovery in the presence of unobserved parentless causes, in the sense that there is a mapping, given by the mixing matrix, between the underlying models to be inferred in these problems. Consequently, any identifiability result based on the mixing matrix for one model translates to an identifiability result for the other model. We characterize to what extent the causal models can be identified under a two-part faithfulness assumption. Under only the first part of the assumption (corresponding to the conventional definition of faithfulness), the structure can be learned up to the causal ordering among an ordered grouping of the variables but not all the edges across the groups can be identified. We further show that if both parts of the faithfulness assumption are imposed, the structure can be learned up to a more refined ordered grouping. As a result of this refinement, for the latent variable model with unobserved parentless causes, the structure can be identified. Based on our theoretical results, we propose causal structure learning methods for both models, and evaluate their performance on synthetic data. ",

    "abstract": "Performance of spoken language understanding (SLU) can be degraded with automatic speech recognition (ASR) errors. We propose a novel approach to improve SLU robustness by randomly corrupting clean training text with an ASR error simulator, followed by self-correcting the errors and minimizing the target classification loss in a joint manner. In the proposed error simulator, we leverage confusion networks generated from an ASR decoder without human transcriptions to generate a variety of error patterns for model training. We evaluate our approach on the DSTC10 challenge targeted for knowledge-grounded task-oriented conversational dialogues with ASR errors. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach, boosting the knowledge-seeking turn detection (KTD) F1 significantly from 0.9433 to 0.9904. Knowledge cluster classification is boosted from 0.7924 to 0.9333 in Recall@1. After knowledge document re-ranking, our approach shows significant improvement in all knowledge selection metrics, from 0.7358 to 0.7806 in Recall@1, from 0.8301 to 0.9333 in Recall@5, and from 0.7798 to 0.8460 in MRR@5 on the test set. In the recent DSTC10 evaluation, our approach demonstrates significant improvement in knowledge selection, boosting Recall@1 from 0.495 to 0.7144 compared to the official baseline.

Recent CPD methods have demonstrated their potential in identifying changes in underlying statistical distributions but often fail to capture complex changes in the correlation structure in time-series data. These methods also fail to generalize effectively, as even within the same time-series, different kinds of change points (CPs) may arise that are best characterized by different types of time-series perturbations. To address this issue, we propose TiVaCPD, a CPD methodology that uses a time-varying graphical lasso based method to identify changes in correlation patterns between features over time, and combines that with an aggregate Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) test to identify subtle changes in the underlying statistical distributions of dynamically established time windows. We evaluate the performance of TiVaCPD in identifying and characterizing various types of CPs in time-series and show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art CPD methods for all categories of CPs.

To address this issue, we introduce a modified version of BC, Adversarial Behavioral Cloning (ABC), that exhibits mode-seeking behavior by incorporating elements of GAN (generative adversarial network) training.

    "abstract": "Multi-intent detection and slot filling joint models are gaining increasing traction since they are closer to complicated real-world scenarios. However, existing approaches (1) focus on identifying implicit correlations between utterances and one-hot encoded labels in both tasks while ignoring explicit label characteristics; (2) directly incorporate multi-intent information for each token, which could lead to incorrect slot prediction due to the introduction of irrelevant intent. In this paper, we propose a framework termed DGIF, which first leverages the semantic information of labels to give the model additional signals and enriched priors. Then, a multi-grain interactive graph is constructed to model correlations between intents and slots. Specifically, we propose a novel approach to construct the interactive graph based on the injection of label semantics, which can automatically update the graph to better alleviate error propagation. Experimental results show that our framework significantly outperforms existing approaches, obtaining a relative improvement of 13.7% over the previous best model on the MixATIS dataset in overall accuracy.

    "abstract": "3D convolutional neural networks have revealed superior performance in processing volumetric data such as video and medical imaging. However, the competitive performance by leveraging 3D networks results in huge computational costs, which are far beyond that of 2D networks. In this paper, we propose a novel Hilbert curve-based cross-dimensionality distillation approach that facilitates the knowledge of 3D networks to improve the performance of 2D networks. The proposed Hilbert Distillation (HD) method preserves the structural information via the Hilbert curve, which maps high-dimensional (>=2) representations to one-dimensional continuous space-filling curves. Since the distilled 2D networks are supervised by the curves converted from dimensionally heterogeneous 3D features, the 2D networks are given an informative view in terms of learning structural information embedded in well-trained high-dimensional representations. We further propose a Variable-length Hilbert Distillation (VHD) method to dynamically shorten the walking stride of the Hilbert curve in activation feature areas and lengthen the stride in context feature areas, forcing the 2D networks to pay more attention to learning from activation features. The proposed algorithm outperforms the current state-of-the-art distillation techniques adapted to cross-dimensionality distillation on two classification tasks. Moreover, the distilled 2D networks by the proposed method achieve competitive performance with the original 3D networks, indicating the lightweight distilled 2D networks could potentially be the substitution of cumbersome 3D networks in the real-world scenario.

    "abstract": "Subgraph matching is to find all subgraphs in a data graph that are isomorphic to an existing query graph. Subgraph matching is an NP-hard problem, yet has found its applications in many areas. Many learning-based methods have been proposed for graph matching, whereas few have been designed for subgraph matching. The subgraph matching problem is generally more challenging, mainly due to the different sizes between the two graphs, resulting in considerable large space of solutions. Also the extra edges existing in the data graph connecting to the matched nodes may lead to two matched nodes of two graphs having different adjacency structures and often being identified as distinct objects. Due to the extra edges, the existing learning based methods often fail to generate sufficiently similar node-level embeddings for matched nodes. This study proposes a novel Adaptive Edge-Deleting Network (AEDNet) for subgraph matching. The proposed method is trained in an end-to-end fashion. In AEDNet, a novel sample-wise adaptive edge-deleting mechanism removes extra edges to ensure consistency of adjacency structure of matched nodes, while a unidirectional cross-propagation mechanism ensures consistency of features of matched nodes. We applied the proposed method on six datasets with graph sizes varying from 20 to 2300. Our evaluations on six open datasets demonstrate that the proposed AEDNet outperforms six state-of-the-arts and is much faster than the exact methods on large graphs. ",

This paper extends NeRFs to handle dynamic scenes in an online fashion. We do so by introducing a particle-based parametric encoding, which allows the intermediate NeRF features -- now coupled to particles in space -- to be moved with the dynamic geometry. We backpropagate the NeRF's photometric reconstruction loss into the position of the particles in addition to the features they are associated with. The position gradients are interpreted as particle velocities and integrated into positions using a position-based dynamics (PBS) physics system. Introducing PBS into the NeRF formulation allows us to add collision constraints to the particle motion and creates future opportunities to add other movement priors into the system such as rigid and deformable body constraints. We show that by allowing the features to move in space, we incrementally adapt the NeRF to the changing scene. ",

Recently, hyperbolic spaces have emerged as a promising alternative for processing graph data with tree-like structure or power-law distribution, owing to the exponential growth property. Different from Euclidean space, which expands polynomially, the hyperbolic space grows exponentially which makes it gains natural advantages in abstracting tree-like or scale-free graphs with hierarchical organizations. In this tutorial, we aim to give an introduction to this emerging field of graph representation learning with the express purpose of being accessible to all audiences. We first give a brief introduction to graph representation learning as well as some preliminary Riemannian and hyperbolic geometry. We then comprehensively revisit the hyperbolic embedding techniques, including hyperbolic shallow models and hyperbolic neural networks. In addition, we introduce the technical details of the current hyperbolic graph neural networks by unifying them into a general framework and summarizing the variants of each component. Moreover, we further introduce a series of related applications in a variety of fields. In the last part, we discuss several advanced topics about hyperbolic geometry for graph representation learning, which potentially serve as guidelines for further flourishing the non-Euclidean graph learning community.

Conventionally, only one embedding is extracted from each speech segment. However, because of the sliding window approach, a segment easily includes two or more speakers owing to speaker change points. This study proposes a novel embedding extractor architecture, referred to as a high-resolution embedding extractor (HEE), which extracts multiple high-resolution embeddings from each speech segment. Hee consists of a feature-map extractor and an enhancer, where the enhancer with the self-attention mechanism is the key to success. The enhancer of HEE replaces the aggregation process; instead of a global pooling layer, the enhancer combines relative information to each frame via attention leveraging the global context. Extracted dense frame-level embeddings can each represent a speaker. Thus, multiple speakers can be represented by different frame-level features in each segment. We also propose an artificially generating mixture data training framework to train the proposed HEE. Through experiments on five evaluation sets, including four public datasets, the proposed HEE demonstrates at least 10% improvement on each evaluation set, except for one dataset, which we analyse that rapid speaker changes less exist.

Prior investigations on this problem incorporate graph kernel as the optimal criteria for measuring the similarity between the new optimized team and the original team. However, the increasingly abundant social networks reveal fundamental limitations of existing methods, including (1) the graph kernel-based approaches are powerless to capture the key intrinsic correlations among node features, (2) they generally search over the entire network for every member to be replaced, making it extremely inefficient as the network grows, and (3) the requirement of equal-sized replacement for the unavailable subteam can be inapplicable due to limited hiring budget. In this work, we address the limitations in the state-of-the-art for subteam replacement by (1) proposing GENIUS, a novel clustering-based graph neural network (GNN) framework that can capture team network knowledge for flexible subteam replacement, and (2) equipping the proposed GENIUS with self-supervised positive team contrasting training scheme to improve the team-level representation learning and unsupervised node clusters to prune candidates for fast computation. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method (1) effectiveness: being able to select better candidate members that significantly increase the similarity between the optimized and original teams, and (2) efficiency: achieving more than 600 times speed-up in average running time.

This work is the first to investigate the impact of private learning techniques on generated explanations for DL-based models. In an extensive experimental analysis covering various image and time series datasets from multiple domains, as well as varying privacy techniques, XAI methods, and model architectures, the effects of private training on generated explanations are studied. The findings suggest non-negligible changes in explanations through the introduction of privacy. Apart from reporting individual effects of PPML on XAI, the paper gives clear recommendations for the choice of techniques in real applications. By unveiling the interdependencies of these pivotal technologies, this work is a first step towards overcoming the remaining hurdles for practically applicable AI in safety-critical domains. ",

Our findings suggest that pro-Russian messages were mainly disseminated through a systematic, coordinated propaganda campaign. Overall, pro-Russian content received ~251,000 retweets and thereby reached around 14.4 million users, primarily in countries such as India, South Africa, and the United States. We further provide evidence that bots played a disproportionate role in the dissemination of propaganda and amplified its proliferation. Overall, 20.28% of the spreaders are classified as bots, most of which were created in the beginning of the invasion. Together, our results highlight the new threats to society that originate from coordinated propaganda campaigns on social media in modern warfare. Our results also suggest that curbing bots may be an effective strategy to mitigate such campaigns. ",

    "abstract": "Property inference attacks against machine learning (ML) models aim to infer properties of the training data that are unrelated to the primary task of the model, and have so far been formulated as binary decision problems, i.e., whether or not the training data have a certain property. However, in industrial and healthcare applications, the proportion of labels in the training data is quite often also considered sensitive information. In this paper we introduce a new type of property inference attack that unlike binary decision problems in literature, aim at inferring the class label distribution of the training data from parameters of ML classifier models. We propose a method based on \\emph{shadow training} and a \\emph{meta-classifier} trained on the parameters of the shadow classifiers augmented with the accuracy of the classifiers on auxiliary data. We evaluate the proposed approach for ML classifiers with fully connected neural network architectures. We find that the proposed \\emph{meta-classifier} attack provides a maximum relative improvement of $52\\%$ over state of the art. ",

As a result, it may be widely applied in engineering domains including feature extraction, compressed sensing, signal denoising, picture clustering, and dictionary learning, just to name a few. In this paper, we propose a spiking sampling network. This network is composed of spiking neurons, and it can dynamically decide which pixel points should be retained and which ones need to be masked according to the input. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach enables better sparse representation of the original image and facilitates image reconstruction compared to random sampling. We thus use this approach for compressing massive data from the dynamic vision sensor, which greatly reduces the storage requirements for event data. ",

Such summaries have immense applications in large-scale graph analytics due to their small size and high query processing efficiency. In this paper, we reformulate the loss minimization problem for summarization into an equivalent integer maximization problem. By initially allowing relaxed (fractional) solutions for integer maximization, we analytically expose the underlying connections to the spectral properties of the adjacency matrix. Consequently, we design an algorithm called SpecSumm that consists of two phases. In the first phase, motivated by spectral graph theory, we apply k-means clustering on the k largest (in magnitude) eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix to assign nodes to supernodes. In the second phase, we propose a greedy heuristic that updates the initial assignment to further improve summary quality. Finally, via extensive experiments on 11 datasets, we show that SpecSumm efficiently produces high-quality summaries compared to state-of-the-art summarization algorithms and scales to graphs with millions of nodes.

Deep neural networks (DNN) are prone to performance reduction and overfitting problems on training data with noisy annotations. Weighting loss methods aim to mitigate the influence of noisy labels during the training, completely removing their contribution. This discarding process prevents DNNs from learning wrong associations between images and their correct labels but reduces the amount of data used, especially when most of the samples have noisy labels. Differently, our method weighs the feature extracted directly from the classifier without altering the loss value of each data. The advisor helps to focus only on some part of the information present in mislabeled examples, allowing the classifier to leverage that data as well. We trained it with a meta-learning strategy so that it can adapt throughout the training of the main model. We tested our method on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 with synthetic noise, and on Clothing1M which contains real-world noise, reporting state-of-the-art results. ",

Experiments on the benchmarks of various language pairs show that our approach can surprisingly do self-correction over the third-party supervision by finding more accurate word alignments and deleting wrong word alignments, leading to better performance than various third-party word aligners, including the currently best one.

The goal of this kind of adversarial attack is to modify the input text to fool a classifier while maintaining the original meaning of the text. Although most existing adversarial attacks claim to fulfill the constraint of semantics preservation, careful scrutiny shows otherwise. We show that the problem lies in the text encoders used to determine the similarity of adversarial examples, specifically in the way they are trained. Unsupervised training methods make these encoders more susceptible to problems with antonym recognition. To overcome this, we introduce a simple, fully supervised sentence embedding technique called Semantics-Preserving-Encoder (SPE). The results show that our solution minimizes the variation in the meaning of the adversarial examples generated. It also significantly improves the overall quality of adversarial examples, as confirmed by human evaluators. Furthermore, it can be used as a component in any existing attack to speed up its execution while maintaining similar attack success. ",

    "abstract": "Most existing deep learning models are trained based on the closed-world assumption, where the test data is assumed to be drawn i.i.d. from the same distribution as the training data, known as in-distribution (ID). However, when models are deployed in an open-world scenario, test samples can be out-of-distribution (OOD) and therefore should be handled with caution. To detect such OOD samples drawn from unknown distribution, OOD detection has received increasing attention lately. However, current endeavors mostly focus on grid-structured data and its application for graph-structured data remains under-explored. Considering the fact that data labeling on graphs is commonly time-expensive and labor-intensive, in this work we study the problem of unsupervised graph OOD detection, aiming at detecting OOD graphs solely based on unlabeled ID data. To achieve this goal, we develop a new graph contrastive learning framework GOOD-D for detecting OOD graphs without using any ground-truth labels. By performing hierarchical contrastive learning on the augmented graphs generated by our perturbation-free graph data augmentation method, GOOD-D is able to capture the latent ID patterns and accurately detect OOD graphs based on the semantic inconsistency in different granularities (i.e., node-level, graph-level, and group-level). As a pioneering work in unsupervised graph-level OOD detection, we build a comprehensive benchmark to compare our proposed approach with different state-of-the-art methods. The experiment results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over different methods on various datasets. ",

In other words, the more the dataset size is large, balanced, and representative, the more one can trust the proposed model's effectiveness and, consequently, the obtained results. Unfortunately, large-size anonymous datasets are generally not publicly available in biomedical applications, especially those dealing with pathological human face images. This concern makes using deep-learning-based approaches challenging to deploy and difficult to reproduce or verify some published results. In this paper, we suggest an efficient method to generate a realistic anonymous synthetic dataset of human faces with the attributes of acne disorders corresponding to three levels of severity (i.e. Mild, Moderate and Severe). Therefore, a specific hierarchy StyleGAN-based algorithm trained at distinct levels is considered. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we consider a CNN-based classification system, trained using the generated synthetic acneic face images and tested using authentic face images. Consequently, we show that an accuracy of 97,6\\% is achieved using InceptionResNetv2. As a result, this work allows the scientific community to employ the generated synthetic dataset for any data processing application without restrictions on legal or ethical concerns. Moreover, this approach can also be extended to other applications requiring the generation of synthetic medical images. We can make the code and the generated dataset accessible for the scientific community. ",

    "abstract": "Unhealthy dietary habits are considered as the primary cause of multiple chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. The automatic food intake monitoring system has the potential to improve the quality of life (QoF) of people with dietary related diseases through dietary assessment. In this work, we propose a novel contact-less radar-based food intake monitoring approach. Specifically, a Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar sensor is employed to recognize fine-grained eating and drinking gestures. The fine-grained eating/drinking gesture contains a series of movement from raising the hand to the mouth until putting away the hand from the mouth. A 3D temporal convolutional network (3D-TCN) is developed to detect and segment eating and drinking gestures in meal sessions by processing the Range-Doppler Cube (RD Cube). Unlike previous radar-based research, this work collects data in continuous meal sessions. We create a public dataset that contains 48 meal sessions (3121 eating gestures and 608 drinking gestures) from 48 participants with a total duration of 783 minutes. Four eating styles (fork & knife, chopsticks, spoon, hand) are included in this dataset. To validate the performance of the proposed approach, 8-fold cross validation method is applied. Experimental results show that our proposed 3D-TCN outperforms the model that combines a convolutional neural network and a long-short-term-memory network (CNN-LSTM), and also the CNN-Bidirectional LSTM model (CNN-BiLSTM) in eating and drinking gesture detection. The 3D-TCN model achieves a segmental F1-score of 0.887 and 0.844 for eating and drinking gestures, respectively. The results of the proposed approach indicate the feasibility of using radar for fine-grained eating and drinking gesture detection and segmentation in meal sessions. ",

Existing schemes rely on long-term estimates, which makes it difficult to distinguish spoofing from movement of a legitimate user. This limitation is here addressed by means of a deep neural network that implicitly learns the distribution of pairs of short-term RSS vector estimates.

For sets $\\sigma,\\rho$ of non-negative integers, a $(\\sigma,\\rho)$-set of a graph $G$ is a set $S$ of vertices such that $|N(u)\\cap S|\\in \\sigma$ for every $u\\in S$, and $|N(v)\\cap S|\\in \\rho$ for every $v\\not\\in S$. The problem of finding a $(\\sigma,\\rho)$-set (of a certain size) unifies standard problems such as Independent Set, Dominating Set, Independent Dominating Set, and many others. For all pairs of finite or cofinite sets $(\\sigma,\\rho)$, we determine (under standard complexity assumptions) the best possible value $c_{\\sigma,\\rho}$ such that there is an algorithm that counts $(\\sigma,\\rho)$-sets in time $c_{\\sigma,\\rho}^{\\sf tw}\\cdot n^{O(1)}$ (if a tree decomposition of width ${\\sf tw}$ is given in the input). For example, for the Exact Independent Dominating Set problem (also known as Perfect Code) corresponding to $\\sigma=\\{0\\}$ and $\\rho=\\{1\\}$, we improve the $3^{\\sf tw}\\cdot n^{O(1)}$ algorithm of [van Rooij, 2020] to $2^{\\sf tw}\\cdot n^{O(1)}$. Despite the unusually delicate definition of $c_{\\sigma,\\rho}$, we show that our algorithms are most likely optimal, i.e., for any pair $(\\sigma, \\rho)$ of finite or cofinite sets where the problem is non-trivial, and any $\\varepsilon>0$, a $(c_{\\sigma,\\rho}-\\varepsilon)^{\\sf tw}\\cdot n^{O(1)}$-algorithm counting the number of $(\\sigma,\\rho)$-sets would violate the Counting Strong Exponential-Time Hypothesis (#SETH). For finite sets $\\sigma$ and $\\rho$, our lower bounds also extend to the decision version, showing that our algorithms are optimal in this setting as well. In contrast, for many cofinite sets, we show that further significant improvements for the decision and optimization versions are possible using the technique of representative sets. ",

    "abstract": "In this article, we evaluate unsupervised anomaly detection methods in multispectral images obtained with a wavelength-independent synthetic aperture sensing technique, called Airborne Optical Sectioning (AOS). With a focus on search and rescue missions that apply drones to locate missing or injured persons in dense forest and require real-time operation, we evaluate runtime vs. quality of these methods. Furthermore, we show that color anomaly detection methods that normally operate in the visual range always benefit from an additional far infrared (thermal) channel. We also show that, even without additional thermal bands, the choice of color space in the visual range already has an impact on the detection results. Color spaces like HSV and HLS have the potential to outperform the widely used RGB color space, especially when color anomaly detection is used for forest-like environments. ",

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks are often touted as brain-inspired learning models for the third wave of Artificial Intelligence. Although recent SNNs trained with supervised backpropagation show classification accuracy comparable to deep networks, the performance of unsupervised learning-based SNNs remains much lower. This paper presents a heterogeneous recurrent spiking neural network (HRSNN) with unsupervised learning for spatio-temporal classification of video activity recognition tasks on RGB (KTH, UCF11, UCF101) and event-based datasets (DVS128 Gesture). The key novelty of the HRSNN is that the recurrent layer in HRSNN consists of heterogeneous neurons with varying firing/relaxation dynamics, and they are trained via heterogeneous spike-time-dependent-plasticity (STDP) with varying learning dynamics for each synapse. We show that this novel combination of heterogeneity in architecture and learning method outperforms current homogeneous spiking neural networks. We further show that HRSNN can achieve similar performance to state-of-the-art backpropagation trained supervised SNN, but with less computation (fewer neurons and sparse connection) and less training data.

Motivated by the `Cause-Effect Pair' NIPS 2013 Workshop on Causality Challenge, in this paper, we take a different approach and generate a probability distribution over all possible graphs informed by the cause-effect pair features proposed in response to the workshop challenge. The goal of the paper is to propose new methods based on this probabilistic information and compare their performance with traditional and state-of-the-art approaches. Our experiments, on both synthetic and real datasets, show that our proposed methods not only have statistically similar or better performances than some traditional approaches but also are computationally faster.

    "abstract": "Linear classifier probes are frequently utilized to better understand how neural networks function. Researchers have approached the problem of determining unit importance in neural networks by probing their learned, internal representations. Linear classifier probes identify highly selective units as the most important for network function. Whether or not a network actually relies on high selectivity units can be tested by removing them from the network using ablation. Surprisingly, when highly selective units are ablated they only produce small performance deficits, and even then only in some cases. In spite of the absence of ablation effects for selective neurons, linear decoding methods can be effectively used to interpret network function, leaving their effectiveness a mystery. To falsify the exclusive role of selectivity in network function and resolve this contradiction, we systematically ablate groups of units in subregions of activation space. Here, we find a weak relationship between neurons identified by probes and those identified by ablation. More specifically, we find that an interaction between selectivity and the average activity of the unit better predicts ablation performance deficits for groups of units in AlexNet, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and ResNet101. Linear decoders are likely somewhat effective because they overlap with those units that are causally important for network function. Interpretability methods could be improved by focusing on causally important units. ",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder, meaning that the symptoms develop gradually throughout the years. It is also the main cause of dementia, which affects memory, thinking skills, and mental abilities. Nowadays, researchers have moved their interest towards AD detection from spontaneous speech, since it constitutes a time-effective procedure. However, existing state-of-the-art works proposing multimodal approaches do not take into consideration the inter- and intra-modal interactions and propose early and late fusion approaches. To tackle these limitations, we propose deep neural networks, which can be trained in an end-to-end trainable way and capture the inter- and intra-modal interactions. Firstly, each audio file is converted to an image consisting of three channels, i.e., log-Mel spectrogram, delta, and delta-delta. Next, each transcript is passed through a BERT model followed by a gated self-attention layer. Similarly, each image is passed through a Swin Transformer followed by an independent gated self-attention layer. Acoustic features are extracted also from each audio file. Finally, the representation vectors from the different modalities are fed to a tensor fusion layer for capturing the inter-modal interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on the ADReSS Challenge dataset indicate that our introduced approaches obtain valuable advantages over existing research initiatives reaching Accuracy and F1-score up to 86.25% and 85.48% respectively.

As top layer predictors are usually nonlinear, this is a difficult task if we seek to deploy standard convex optimization methods and strong duality. To overcome this, we introduce a new saddle-point Lagrangian with auxiliary predictor variables on which constraints are imposed. Elimination of the auxiliary variables leads to a dual minimization problem on the Lagrange multipliers introduced to satisfy the linear constraints. This minimization problem is combined with the standard learning problem on the weight matrices. From this theoretical line of development, we obtain the surprising interpretation of Lagrange parameters as additional, penultimate layer hidden units with fixed weights stemming from the constraints. Consequently, standard minimization approaches can be used despite the inclusion of Lagrange parameters -- a very satisfying, albeit unexpected, discovery. Examples ranging from multi-label classification to constrained autoencoders are envisaged in the future. ",

The paper illustrates the proposed attack on the real-time fault line localization application. Furthermore, the simulation results on the 68-bus power system demonstrate that DL-based fault line localization methods are not robust to our proposed attack, indicating that backdoor poisoning attacks pose real threats to DL implementations in power systems. The proposed attack pipeline can be easily generalized to other power system tasks. ",

We investigate the complexity of finding a square coloring with a given number of $q$ colors. We show that the problem is polynomial-time solvable on graphs of bounded treewidth by presenting an algorithm with running time $n^{2^{\\operatorname{tw} + 4}+O(1)}$ for graphs of treewidth at most $\\operatorname{tw}$. The somewhat unusual exponent $2^{\\operatorname{tw}}$ in the running time is essentially optimal: we show that for any $\\epsilon>0$, there is no algorithm with running time $f(\\operatorname{tw})n^{(2-\\epsilon)^{\\operatorname{tw}}}$ unless the Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. We also show that the square coloring problem is NP-hard on planar graphs for any fixed number $q \\ge 4$ of colors. Our main algorithmic result is showing that the problem (when the number of colors $q$ is part of the input) can be solved in subexponential time $2^{O(n^{2/3}\\log n)}$ on planar graphs. The result follows from the combination of two algorithms. If the number $q$ of colors is small ($\\le n^{1/3}$), then we can exploit a treewidth bound on the square of the graph to solve the problem in time $2^{O(\\sqrt{qn}\\log n)}$.

We show how to automatically generate new detection methods based on training a neural network. Our approach is motivated by many existing tests for the presence of a change-point being able to be represented by a simple neural network, and thus a neural network trained with sufficient data should have performance at least as good as these methods. We present theory that quantifies the error rate for such an approach, and how it depends on the amount of training data. Empirical results show that, even with limited training data, its performance is competitive with the standard CUSUM test for detecting a change in mean when the noise is independent and Gaussian, and can substantially outperform it in the presence of auto-correlated or heavy-tailed noise. Our method also shows strong results in detecting and localising changes in activity based on accelerometer data. ",

Studies are therefore dependent on subgrid models to emulate the micro physics of dust coagulation on top of a large scale hydrodynamic simulation. Numerical simulations which include the relevant physical effects are complex and computationally expensive. Here, we present a fast and accurate learned effective model for dust coagulation, trained on data from high resolution numerical coagulation simulations. Our model captures details of the dust coagulation process that were so far not tractable with other dust coagulation prescriptions with similar computational efficiency. ",

    "title": "Pushing the limits of self-supervised speaker verification using  regularized distillation framework",
    "abstract": "Training robust speaker verification systems without speaker labels has long been a challenging task. Previous studies observed a large performance gap between self-supervised and fully supervised methods. In this paper, we apply a non-contrastive self-supervised learning framework called DIstillation with NO labels (DINO) and propose two regularization terms applied to embeddings in DINO. One regularization term guarantees the diversity of the embeddings, while the other regularization term decorrelates the variables of each embedding. The effectiveness of various data augmentation techniques are explored, on both time and frequency domain. A range of experiments conducted on the VoxCeleb datasets demonstrate the superiority of the regularized DINO framework in speaker verification. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art speaker verification performance under a single-stage self-supervised setting on VoxCeleb. The codes will be made publicly-available. ",

    "abstract": "The prediction of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma therapy response is a clinically challenging and important task in this high-mortality tumour entity. The training of neural networks able to tackle this challenge is impeded by a lack of large datasets and the difficult anatomical localisation of the pancreas. Here, we propose a hybrid deep neural network pipeline to predict tumour response to initial chemotherapy which is based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) score, a standardised method for cancer response evaluation by clinicians as well as tumour markers, and clinical evaluation of the patients. We leverage a combination of representation transfer from segmentation to classification, as well as localisation and representation learning. Our approach yields a remarkably data-efficient method able to predict treatment response with a ROC-AUC of 63.7% using only 477 datasets in total. ",
