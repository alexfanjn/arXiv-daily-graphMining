    "abstract": "The effective receptive field of a fully convolutional neural network is an important consideration when designing an architecture, as it defines the portion of the input visible to each convolutional kernel. We propose a neural network module, extending traditional skip connections, called the translated skip connection. Translated skip connections geometrically increase the receptive field of an architecture with negligible impact on both the size of the parameter space and computational complexity. By embedding translated skip connections into a benchmark architecture, we demonstrate that our module matches or outperforms four other approaches to expanding the effective receptive fields of fully convolutional neural networks. We confirm this result across five contemporary image segmentation datasets from disparate domains, including the detection of COVID-19 infection, segmentation of aerial imagery, common object segmentation, and segmentation for self-driving cars.

    "title": "Handwritten Arabic Character Recognition for Children Writ-ing Using  Convolutional Neural Network and Stroke Identification",
    "abstract": "Automatic Arabic handwritten recognition is one of the recently studied problems in the field of Machine Learning. Unlike Latin languages, Arabic is a Semitic language that forms a harder challenge, especially with variability of patterns caused by factors such as writer age. Most of the studies focused on adults, with only one recent study on children. Moreover, much of the recent Machine Learning methods focused on using Convolutional Neural Networks, a powerful class of neural networks that can extract complex features from images. In this paper we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that recognizes children handwriting with an accuracy of 91% on the Hijja dataset, a recent dataset built by collecting images of the Arabic characters written by children, and 97% on Arabic Handwritten Character Dataset. The results showed a good improvement over the proposed model from the Hijja dataset authors, yet it reveals a bigger challenge to solve for children Arabic handwritten character recognition. Moreover, we proposed a new approach using multi models instead of single model based on the number of strokes in a character, and merged Hijja with AHCD which reached an averaged prediction accuracy of 96%.

    "abstract": "The global Information and Communications Technology (ICT) supply chain is a complex network consisting of all types of participants. It is often formulated as a Social Network to discuss the supply chain network's relations, properties, and development in supply chain management. Information sharing plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency of the supply chain, and datasheets are the most common data format to describe e-component commodities in the ICT supply chain because of human readability. However, with the surging number of electronic documents, it has been far beyond the capacity of human readers, and it is also challenging to process tabular data automatically because of the complex table structures and heterogeneous layouts. Table Structure Recognition (TSR) aims to represent tables with complex structures in a machine-interpretable format so that the tabular data can be processed automatically. In this paper, we formulate TSR as an object detection problem and propose to generate an intuitive representation of a complex table structure to enable structuring of the tabular data related to the commodities. To cope with border-less and small layouts, we propose a cost-sensitive loss function by considering the detection difficulty of each class. Besides, we propose a novel anchor generation method using the character of tables that columns in a table should share an identical height, and rows in a table should share the same width. We implement our proposed method based on Faster-RCNN and achieve 94.79% on mean Average Precision (AP), and consistently improve more than 1.5% AP for different benchmark models. ",

Rather than directly encoding or targeting three-dimensional poses, MolCLaSS matches a similarity objective based on Gaussian overlays to learn a meaningful representation of molecular shape. We demonstrate how this framework naturally captures key aspects of three-dimensionality that two-dimensional representations cannot and provides an inductive framework for scaffold hopping. ",

    "title": "Can Querying for Bias Leak Protected Attributes? Achieving Privacy With  Smooth Sensitivity",
    "abstract": "Existing regulations prohibit model developers from accessing protected attributes (gender, race, etc.), often resulting in fairness assessments on populations without knowing their protected groups. In such scenarios, institutions often adopt a separation between the model developers (who train models with no access to the protected attributes) and a compliance team (who may have access to the entire dataset for auditing purpose). However, the model developers might be allowed to test their models for bias by querying the compliance team for group fairness metrics. In this paper, we first demonstrate that simply querying for fairness metrics, such as statistical parity and equalized odds can leak the protected attributes of individuals to the model developers. We demonstrate that there always exist strategies by which the model developers can identify the protected attribute of a targeted individual in the test dataset from just a single query. In particular, we show that one can reconstruct the protected attributes of all the individuals from O(Nk log n/Nk) queries when Nk<<n using techniques from compressed sensing (n: size of the test dataset, Nk: size of smallest group). Our results pose an interesting debate in algorithmic fairness: should querying for fairness metrics be viewed as a neutral-valued solution to ensure compliance with regulations? Or, does it constitute a violation of regulations and privacy if the number of queries answered is enough for the model developers to identify the protected attributes of specific individuals? To address this supposed violation, we also propose Attribute-Conceal, a novel technique that achieves differential privacy by calibrating noise to the smooth sensitivity of our bias query, outperforming naive techniques such as Laplace mechanism. We also include experimental results on the Adult dataset and synthetic data (broad range of parameters). ",

    "abstract": "In peer review systems, reviewers are often asked to evaluate various features of submissions, such as technical quality or novelty. A score is given to each of the predefined features and based on these the reviewer has to provide an overall quantitative recommendation. However, reviewers differ in how much they value different features. It may be assumed that each reviewer has her own mapping from a set of criteria scores (score vectors) to a recommendation, and that different reviewers have different mappings in mind. Recently, Noothigattu, Shah and Procaccia introduced a novel framework for obtaining an aggregated mapping by means of Empirical Risk Minimization based on $L(p,q)$ loss functions, and studied its axiomatic properties in the sense of social choice theory. We provide a body of new results about this framework. On the one hand we study a trade-off between strategy-proofness and the ability of the method to properly capture agreements of the majority of reviewers. On the other hand, we show that dropping a certain unrealistic assumption makes the previously reported results to be no longer valid. Moreover, in the general case, strategy-proofness fails dramatically in the sense that a reviewer is able to make significant changes to the solution in her favor by arbitrarily small changes to their true beliefs. In particular, no approximate version of strategy-proofness is possible in this general setting since the method is not even continuous w.r.t. the data. Finally we propose a modified aggregation algorithm which is continuous and show that it has good axiomatic properties. ",

    "abstract": "Time series motif discovery has been a fundamental task to identify meaningful repeated patterns in time series. Recently, time series chains were introduced as an expansion of time series motifs to identify the continuous evolving patterns in time series data. Informally, a time series chain (TSC) is a temporally ordered set of time series subsequences, in which every subsequence is similar to the one that precedes it, but the last and the first can be arbitrarily dissimilar. TSCs are shown to be able to reveal latent continuous evolving trends in the time series, and identify precursors of unusual events in complex systems. Despite its promising interpretability, unfortunately, we have observed that existing TSC definitions lack the ability to accurately cover the evolving part of a time series: the discovered chains can be easily cut by noise and can include non-evolving patterns, making them impractical in real-world applications. Inspired by a recent work that tracks how the nearest neighbor of a time series subsequence changes over time, we introduce a new TSC definition which is much more robust to noise in the data, in the sense that they can better locate the evolving patterns while excluding the non-evolving ones. We further propose two new quality metrics to rank the discovered chains. With extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed TSC definition is significantly more robust to noise than the state of the art, and the top ranked chains discovered can reveal meaningful regularities in a variety of real world datasets.

However, commercial edge platforms based on standard GPUs are not optimized to deploy SNNs, resulting in high energy and latency. While analog In-Memory Computing (IMC) platforms can serve as energy-efficient inference engines, they are accursed by the immense energy, latency, and area requirements of high-precision ADCs (HP-ADC), overshadowing the benefits of in-memory computations. We propose a hardware/software co-design methodology to deploy SNNs into an ADC-Less IMC architecture using sense-amplifiers as 1-bit ADCs replacing conventional HP-ADCs and alleviating the above issues. Our proposed framework incurs minimal accuracy degradation by performing hardware-aware training and is able to scale beyond simple image classification tasks to more complex sequential regression tasks. Experiments on complex tasks of optical flow estimation and gesture recognition show that progressively increasing the hardware awareness during SNN training allows the model to adapt and learn the errors due to the non-idealities associated with ADC-Less IMC. Also, the proposed ADC-Less IMC offers significant energy and latency improvements, $2-7\\times$ and $8.9-24.6\\times$, respectively, depending on the SNN model and the workload, compared to HP-ADC IMC.

Stochastic defect detection and classification during semiconductor manufacturing has grown to be a challenging task as we continuously shrink circuit pattern dimensions (e.g., for pitches less than 32 nm). Defect inspection and analysis by state-of-the-art optical and e-beam inspection tools is generally driven by some rule-based techniques, which in turn often causes to misclassification and thereby necessitating human expert intervention. In this work, we have revisited and extended our previous deep learning-based defect classification and detection method towards improved defect instance segmentation in SEM images with precise extent of defect as well as generating a mask for each defect category/instance. This also enables to extract and calibrate each segmented mask and quantify the pixels that make up each mask, which in turn enables us to count each categorical defect instances as well as to calculate the surface area in terms of pixels. We are aiming at detecting and segmenting different types of inter-class stochastic defect patterns such as bridge, break, and line collapse as well as to differentiate accurately between intra-class multi-categorical defect bridge scenarios (as thin/single/multi-line/horizontal/non-horizontal) for aggressive pitches as well as thin resists (High NA applications).

However, most existing DAOD methods are dominated by computationally intensive two-stage detectors, which are not the first choice for industrial applications. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised domain adaptive YOLO (SSDA-YOLO) based method to improve cross-domain detection performance by integrating the compact one-stage detector YOLOv5 with domain adaptation. Specifically, we adapt the knowledge distillation framework with the Mean Teacher model to assist the student model in obtaining instance-level features of the unlabeled target domain. We also utilize the scene style transfer to cross-generate pseudo images in different domains for remedying image-level differences. In addition, an intuitive consistency loss is proposed to further align cross-domain predictions. We evaluate our proposed SSDA-YOLO on public benchmarks including PascalVOC, Clipart1k, Cityscapes, and Foggy Cityscapes. Moreover, to verify its generalization, we conduct experiments on yawning detection datasets collected from various classrooms.

As they are widely deployed in neuromorphic devices for low-power brain-inspired computing, security issues become increasingly important. However, compared to deep neural networks (DNNs), SNNs currently lack specifically designed defense methods against adversarial attacks. Inspired by neural membrane potential oscillation, we propose a novel neural model that incorporates the bio-inspired oscillation mechanism to enhance the security of SNNs. Our experiments show that SNNs with neural oscillation neurons have better resistance to adversarial attacks than ordinary SNNs with LIF neurons on kinds of architectures and datasets. Furthermore, we propose a defense method that changes model's gradients by replacing the form of oscillation, which hides the original training gradients and confuses the attacker into using gradients of 'fake' neurons to generate invalid adversarial samples. Our experiments suggest that the proposed defense method can effectively resist both single-step and iterative attacks with comparable defense effectiveness and much less computational costs than adversarial training methods on DNNs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that establishes adversarial defense through masking surrogate gradients on SNNs. ",

In this paper, a collaborative bi-directional aggregation method (COBA) for directed graphs embedding is proposed by introducing spatial-based graph convolution. Firstly, the source and target embeddings of the central node are learned by aggregating from the counterparts of the source and target neighbors, respectively; Secondly, the source/target embeddings of the zero in/out degree central nodes are enhanced by aggregating the counterparts of opposite-directional neighbors (i.e. target/source neighbors); Finally, source and target embeddings of the same node are correlated to achieve collaborative aggregation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the COBA comprehensively outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple tasks and meanwhile validates the effectiveness of proposed aggregation strategies.

Successful kidney transplants still fail over time, known as graft failure; however, the time to graft failure, or graft survival time, can vary significantly between different recipients. A significant biological factor affecting graft survival times is the compatibility between the human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) of the donor and recipient. We propose to model HLA compatibility using a network, where the nodes denote different HLAs of the donor and recipient, and edge weights denote compatibilities of the HLAs, which can be positive or negative. The network is indirectly observed, as the edge weights are estimated from transplant outcomes rather than directly observed. We propose a latent space model for such indirectly-observed weighted and signed networks. We demonstrate that our latent space model can not only result in more accurate estimates of HLA compatibilities, but can also be incorporated into survival analysis models to improve accuracy for the downstream task of predicting graft survival times.

Machine learning based NER models are increasingly being applied in privacy-sensitive applications that need automatic and scalable identification of sensitive information to redact text for data sharing. In this paper, we study the setting when NER models are available as a black-box service for identifying sensitive information in user documents and show that these models are vulnerable to membership inference on their training datasets. With updated pre-trained NER models from spaCy, we demonstrate two distinct membership attacks on these models. Our first attack capitalizes on unintended memorization in the NER's underlying neural network, a phenomenon NNs are known to be vulnerable to. Our second attack leverages a timing side-channel to target NER models that maintain vocabularies constructed from the training data. We show that different functional paths of words within the training dataset in contrast to words not previously seen have measurable differences in execution time. Revealing membership status of training samples has clear privacy implications, e.g., in text redaction, sensitive words or phrases to be found and removed, are at risk of being detected in the training dataset. Our experimental evaluation includes the redaction of both password and health data, presenting both security risks and privacy/regulatory issues. This is exacerbated by results that show memorization with only a single phrase. We achieved 70% AUC in our first attack on a text redaction use-case. We also show overwhelming success in the timing attack with 99.23% AUC. Finally we discuss potential mitigation approaches to realize the safe use of NER models in light of the privacy and security implications of membership inference attacks. ",

    "abstract": "Adaptive optimization methods are well known to achieve superior convergence relative to vanilla gradient methods. The traditional viewpoint in optimization, particularly in convex optimization, explains this improved performance by arguing that, unlike vanilla gradient schemes, adaptive algorithms mimic the behavior of a second-order method by adapting to the global geometry of the loss function. We argue that in the context of neural network optimization, this traditional viewpoint is insufficient. Instead, we advocate for a local trajectory analysis. For iterate trajectories produced by running a generic optimization algorithm OPT, we introduce $R^{\\text{OPT}}_{\\text{med}}$, a statistic that is analogous to the condition number of the loss Hessian evaluated at the iterates. Through extensive experiments, we show that adaptive methods such as Adam bias the trajectories towards regions where $R^{\\text{Adam}}_{\\text{med}}$ is small, where one might expect faster convergence. By contrast, vanilla gradient methods like SGD bias the trajectories towards regions where $R^{\\text{SGD}}_{\\text{med}}$ is comparatively large. We complement these empirical observations with a theoretical result that provably demonstrates this phenomenon in the simplified setting of a two-layer linear network. We view our findings as evidence for the need of a new explanation of the success of adaptive methods, one that is different than the conventional wisdom. ",

In this paper, we report on our experiences generating multiple code explanation types using LLMs and integrating them into an interactive e-book on web software development. We modified the e-book to make LLM-generated code explanations accessible through buttons next to code snippets in the materials, which allowed us to track the use of the explanations as well as to ask for feedback on their utility. Three different types of explanations were available for students for each explainable code snippet; a line-by-line explanation, a list of important concepts, and a high-level summary of the code. Our preliminary results show that all varieties of explanations were viewed by students and that the majority of students perceived the code explanations as helpful to them. However, student engagement appeared to vary by code snippet complexity, explanation type, and code snippet length. Drawing on our experiences, we discuss future directions for integrating explanations generated by LLMs into existing computer science classrooms. ",

    "abstract": "Prior work on ideology prediction has largely focused on single modalities, i.e., text or images. In this work, we introduce the task of multimodal ideology prediction, where a model predicts binary or five-point scale ideological leanings, given a text-image pair with political content. We first collect five new large-scale datasets with English documents and images along with their ideological leanings, covering news articles from a wide range of US mainstream media and social media posts from Reddit and Twitter. We conduct in-depth analyses of news articles and reveal differences in image content and usage across the political spectrum. Furthermore, we perform extensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating the effectiveness of targeted pretraining objectives on different model components. Our best-performing model, a late-fusion architecture pretrained with a triplet objective over multimodal content, outperforms the state-of-the-art text-only model by almost 4% and a strong multimodal baseline with no pretraining by over 3%.

    "abstract": "We show that it is possible to predict which deep network has generated a given logit vector with accuracy well above chance. We utilize a number of networks on a dataset, initialized with random weights or pretrained weights, as well as fine-tuned networks. A classifier is then trained on the logit vectors of the trained set of this dataset to map the logit vector to the network index that has generated it. The classifier is then evaluated on the test set of the dataset. Results are better with randomly initialized networks, but also generalize to pretrained networks as well as fine-tuned ones. Classification accuracy is higher using unnormalized logits than normalized ones. We find that there is little transfer when applying a classifier to the same networks but with different sets of weights. In addition to help better understand deep networks and the way they encode uncertainty, we anticipate our finding to be useful in some applications (e.g. tailoring an adversarial attack for a certain type of network).

    "abstract": "Deep learning technology has made great progress in multi-view 3D reconstruction tasks. At present, most mainstream solutions establish the mapping between views and shape of an object by assembling the networks of 2D encoder and 3D decoder as the basic structure while they adopt different approaches to obtain aggregation of features from several views. Among them, the methods using attention-based fusion perform better and more stable than the others, however, they still have an obvious shortcoming -- the strong independence of each view during predicting the weights for merging leads to a lack of adaption of the global state. In this paper, we propose a global-aware attention-based fusion approach that builds the correlation between each branch and the global to provide a comprehensive foundation for weights inference. In order to enhance the ability of the network, we introduce a novel loss function to supervise the shape overall and propose a dynamic two-stage training strategy that can effectively adapt to all reconstructors with attention-based fusion. Experiments on ShapeNet verify that our method outperforms existing SOTA methods while the amount of parameters is far less than the same type of algorithm, Pix2Vox++. Furthermore, we propose a view-reduction method based on maximizing diversity and discuss the cost-performance tradeoff of our model to achieve a better performance when facing heavy input amount and limited computational cost.

These factors could lead to load imbalances, which affect scheduling efficiency and resource utilization. A scheduling method called Dynamic Resource Allocation for Load Balancing (DRALB) is proposed. The proposed solution constitutes two steps: First, the load manager analyzes the resource requirements such as CPU, Memory, Energy and Bandwidth usage and allocates an appropriate number of VMs for each application. Second, the resource information is collected and updated where resources are sorted into four queues according to the loads of resources i.e. CPU intensive, Memory intensive, Energy intensive and Bandwidth intensive. We demonstarate that SLA-aware scheduling not only facilitates the cloud consumers by resources availability and improves throughput, response time etc. but also maximizes the cloud profits with less resource utilization and SLA (Service Level Agreement) violation penalties. This method is based on diversity of clients applications and searching the optimal resources for the particular deployment. Experiments were carried out based on following parameters i.e. average response time; resource utilization, SLA violation rate and load balancing. The experimental results demonstrate that this method can reduce the wastage of resources and reduces the traffic upto 44.89 and 58.49 in the network. ",

With increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, a coordinated market-based operation of the two networks can yield significant advantages, as reduced need for grid reinforcements, by optimizing the power flows in the coupled systems. Transactive control has been developed as a promising approach based on market and control mechanisms to coordinate supply and demand in energy systems, which when applied to power systems is being referred to as transactive energy. However, this approach has not been fully investigated in the context of market-based operation of coupled electric power and district heating networks. Therefore, this paper proposes a transactive control approach to coordinate flexible producers and consumers while taking into account the operational aspects of both networks, for the benefit of all participants and considering their privacy. A nonlinear model predictive control approach is applied in this work to maximize the social welfare of both networks, taking into account system operational limits, while reducing losses and considering system dynamics and forecasted power supply and demand of inflexible producers and consumers. A subtle approximation of the operational optimization problem is used to enable the practical application of the proposed approach in real time. The presented technique is implemented, tested, and demonstrated in a realistic test system, illustrating its benefits. ",

One prominent propositionalization algorithm is RELAGGS by Krogel and Wrobel, which transforms the data by nested aggregations. We propose a new neural network based algorithm in the spirit of RELAGGS that employs trainable composite aggregate functions instead of the static aggregate functions used in the original approach. In this way, we can jointly train the propositionalization with the prediction model, or, alternatively, use the learned aggegrations as embeddings in other algorithms.

    "abstract": "The Skolem problem is a long-standing open problem in linear dynamical systems: can a linear recurrence sequence (LRS) ever reach 0 from a given initial configuration? Similarly, the positivity problem asks whether the LRS stays positive from an initial configuration. Deciding Skolem (or positivity) has been open for half a century: the best known decidability results are for LRS with special properties (e.g., low order recurrences). But these problems are easier for ``uninitialized'' variants, where the initial configuration is not fixed but can vary arbitrarily: checking if there is an initial configuration from which the LRS stays positive can be decided in polynomial time (Tiwari in 2004, Braverman in 2006). In this paper, we consider problems that lie between the initialized and uninitialized variant. More precisely, we ask if 0 (resp. negative numbers) can be avoided from every initial configuration in a neighborhood of a given initial configuration. This can be considered as a robust variant of the Skolem (resp. positivity) problem. We show that these problems lie at the frontier of decidability: if the neighbourhood is given as part of the input, then robust Skolem and robust positivity are Diophantine hard, i.e., solving either would entail major breakthrough in Diophantine approximations, as happens for (non-robust) positivity. However, if one asks whether such a neighbourhood exists, then the problems turn out to be decidable with PSPACE complexity. Our techniques also allow us to tackle robustness for ultimate positivity, which asks whether there is a bound on the number of steps after which the LRS remains positive. There are two variants depending on whether we ask for a ``uniform'' bound on this number of steps. For the non-uniform variant, when the neighbourhood is open, the problem turns out to be tractable, even when the neighbourhood is given as input. ",

In this paper, we start from the general idea above and develop a new learning solution for SER, which is based on Compact Convolutional Transformers (CCTs) combined with a speaker embedding. With CCTs, the learning power of Vision Transformers (ViT) is combined with a diminished need for large volume of data as made possible by the convolution. This is important in SER, where large corpora of data are usually not available. The speaker embedding allows the network to extract an identity representation of the speaker, which is then integrated by means of a self-attention mechanism with the features that the CCT extracts from the spectrogram. Overall, the solution is capable of operating in real-time showing promising results in a cross-corpus scenario, where training and test datasets are kept separate.

The definition of both naturally determines that clustering must play a positive role in obtaining accurate link prediction tasks. Yet researchers have long ignored or used inappropriate ways to undermine this positive relationship. In this article, We construct a simple but efficient clustering-driven link prediction framework(ClusterLP), with the goal of directly exploiting the cluster structures to obtain connections between nodes as accurately as possible in both undirected graphs and directed graphs. Specifically, we propose that it is easier to establish links between nodes with similar representation vectors and cluster tendencies in undirected graphs, while nodes in a directed graphs can more easily point to nodes similar to their representation vectors and have greater influence in their own cluster. We customized the implementation of ClusterLP for undirected and directed graphs, respectively, and the experimental results using multiple real-world networks on the link prediction task showed that our models is highly competitive with existing baseline models.

    "abstract": "Tensor robust principal component analysis (TRPCA) is a promising way for low-rank tensor recovery, which minimizes the convex surrogate of tensor rank by shrinking each tensor singular values equally. However, for real-world visual data, large singular values represent more signifiant information than small singular values. In this paper, we propose a nonconvex TRPCA (N-TRPCA) model based on the tensor adjustable logarithmic norm. Unlike TRPCA, our N-TRPCA can adaptively shrink small singular values more and shrink large singular values less. In addition, TRPCA assumes that the whole data tensor is of low rank. This assumption is hardly satisfied in practice for natural visual data, restricting the capability of TRPCA to recover the edges and texture details from noisy images and videos. To this end, we integrate nonlocal self-similarity into N-TRPCA, and further develop a nonconvex and nonlocal TRPCA (NN-TRPCA) model. Specifically, similar nonlocal patches are grouped as a tensor and then each group tensor is recovered by our N-TRPCA. Since the patches in one group are highly correlated, all group tensors have strong low-rank property, leading to an improvement of recovery performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NN-TRPCA outperforms some existing TRPCA methods in visual data recovery. The demo code is available at https://github.com/qguo2010/NN-TRPCA. ",

Therefore, we propose a novel fusion strategy to integrate radar data into a dense prediction transformer network by reassembling camera representations with radar representations. Instead of using readout tokens, radar representations contribute additional depth information to a monocular depth estimation model and improve performance. We further investigate different fusion approaches that are commonly used for integrating additional modality in a dense prediction transformer network. The experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, which includes camera images, lidar, and radar data. The results show that our proposed method yields better performance than the commonly used fusion strategies and outperforms existing convolutional depth estimation models that fuse camera images and radar.

These techniques are generalized to a wide range of collision spaces and equilibrium distributions. The article contains an overview of lbmpy's front-end and its code generation pipeline, which implements the new LBM calculus by means of symbolic formula manipulation tools and object-oriented programming. The generated codes have only a minimal number of arithmetic operations. Their automatic derivation rests on two novel Chimera transforms that have been specifically developed for efficiently computing raw and central moments. Information contained in the symbolic representation of the methods is further exploited in a customized sequence of algebraic simplifications, further reducing computational cost. When combined, these algebraic transformations lead to concise and compact numerical kernels. Specifically, with these optimizations, the advanced central moment- and cumulant-based methods can be realized with only little additional cost as when compared with the simple BGK method. The effectiveness and flexibility of the new lbmpy code generation system is demonstrated in simulating Taylor-Green vortex decay and the automatic derivation of an LBM algorithm to solve the shallow water equations.

    "abstract": "This paper presents an accurate, highly efficient, and learning-free method for large-scale odometry estimation using spinning radar, empirically found to generalize well across very diverse environments -- outdoors, from urban to woodland, and indoors in warehouses and mines - without changing parameters. Our method integrates motion compensation within a sweep with one-to-many scan registration that minimizes distances between nearby oriented surface points and mitigates outliers with a robust loss function. Extending our previous approach CFEAR, we present an in-depth investigation on a wider range of data sets, quantifying the importance of filtering, resolution, registration cost and loss functions, keyframe history, and motion compensation. We present a new solving strategy and configuration that overcomes previous issues with sparsity and bias, and improves our state-of-the-art by 38%, thus, surprisingly, outperforming radar SLAM and approaching lidar SLAM. The most accurate configuration achieves 1.09% error at 5Hz on the Oxford benchmark, and the fastest achieves 1.79% error at 160Hz. ",

    "abstract": "Technical indicators use graphic representations of data sets by applying various mathematical formulas to financial time series of prices. These formulas comprise a set of rules and parameters whose values are not necessarily known and depend on many factors: the market in which it operates, the size of the time window, and others. This paper focuses on the real-time optimization of the parameters applied for analyzing time series of data. In particular, we optimize the parameters of technical and financial indicators and propose other applications, such as glucose time series. We propose the combination of several Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). Unlike other approaches, this paper applies a set of different MOEAs, collaborating to construct a global Pareto Set of solutions. Solutions for financial problems seek high returns with minimal risk. The optimization process is continuous and occurs at the same frequency as the investment time interval. This technique permits the application of non-dominated solutions obtained with different MOEAs simultaneously. Experimental results show that this technique increases the returns of the commonly used Buy \\& Hold strategy and other multi-objective strategies, even for daily operations. ",

A standard method in adversarial robustness assumes a framework to defend against samples crafted by minimally perturbing a sample such that its corresponding model output changes. These sensitivity attacks exploit the model's sensitivity toward task-irrelevant features. Another form of adversarial sample can be crafted via invariance attacks, which exploit the model underestimating the importance of relevant features. Previous literature has indicated a tradeoff in defending against both attack types within a strictly L_p bounded defense. To promote robustness toward both types of attacks beyond Euclidean distance metrics, we use metric learning to frame adversarial regularization as an optimal transport problem. Our preliminary results indicate that regularizing over invariant perturbations in our framework improves both invariant and sensitivity defense. ",

These approaches are evaluated for automatic speech recognition on the Librispeech corpus, where 100 hours of data served as the labelled data and 860 hours as the unlabelled data. The biased training outperforms the unbiased training by 15.5% after 250k updates and 23.8% after 100k updates on test-other.

    "abstract": "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely applied to deal with temporal problems, such as flood forecasting and financial data processing. On the one hand, traditional RNNs models amplify the gradient issue due to the strict time serial dependency, making it difficult to realize a long-term memory function. On the other hand, RNNs cells are highly complex, which will significantly increase computational complexity and cause waste of computational resources during model training. In this paper, an improved Time Feedforward Connections Recurrent Neural Networks (TFC-RNNs) model was first proposed to address the gradient issue. A parallel branch was introduced for the hidden state at time t-2 to be directly transferred to time t without the nonlinear transformation at time t-1. This is effective in improving the long-term dependence of RNNs. Then, a novel cell structure named Single Gate Recurrent Unit (SGRU) was presented. This cell structure can reduce the number of parameters for RNNs cell, consequently reducing the computational complexity. Next, applying SGRU to TFC-RNNs as a new TFC-SGRU model solves the above two difficulties. Finally, the performance of our proposed TFC-SGRU was verified through several experiments in terms of long-term memory and anti-interference capabilities. Experimental results demonstrated that our proposed TFC-SGRU model can capture helpful information with time step 1500 and effectively filter out the noise. The TFC-SGRU model accuracy is better than the LSTM and GRU models regarding language processing ability. ",

    "abstract": "Pushing artificial intelligence (AI) from central cloud to network edge has reached board consensus in both industry and academia for materializing the vision of artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) in the sixth-generation (6G) era. This gives rise to an emerging research area known as edge intelligence, which concerns the distillation of human-like intelligence from the huge amount of data scattered at wireless network edge. In general, realizing edge intelligence corresponds to the process of sensing, communication, and computation, which are coupled ingredients for data generation, exchanging, and processing, respectively. However, conventional wireless networks design the sensing, communication, and computation separately in a task-agnostic manner, which encounters difficulties in accommodating the stringent demands of ultra-low latency, ultra-high reliability, and high capacity in emerging AI applications such as auto-driving. This thus prompts a new design paradigm of seamless integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) in a task-oriented manner, which comprehensively accounts for the use of the data in the downstream AI applications. In view of its growing interest, this article provides a timely overview of ISCC for edge intelligence by introducing its basic concept, design challenges, and enabling techniques, surveying the state-of-the-art development, and shedding light on the road ahead.

Sequential modeling is an important task with high scientific and commercial value. Existing VQC or QNN-based methods require significant computational resources to perform the gradient-based optimization of a larger number of quantum circuit parameters. The major drawback is that such quantum gradient calculation requires a large amount of circuit evaluation, posing challenges in current near-term quantum hardware and simulation software. In this work, we approach sequential modeling by applying a reservoir computing (RC) framework to quantum recurrent neural networks (QRNN-RC) that are based on classical RNN, LSTM and GRU. The main idea to this RC approach is that the QRNN with randomly initialized weights is treated as a dynamical system and only the final classical linear layer is trained. Our numerical simulations show that the QRNN-RC can reach results comparable to fully trained QRNN models for several function approximation and time series prediction tasks. Since the QRNN training complexity is significantly reduced, the proposed model trains notably faster. In this work we also compare to corresponding classical RNN-based RC implementations and show that the quantum version learns faster by requiring fewer training epochs in most cases. Our results demonstrate a new possibility to utilize quantum neural network for sequential modeling with greater quantum hardware efficiency, an important design consideration for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers.

Existing work has focused on understanding the robustness of vision-and-language models to imperceptible variations on benchmark tasks. In this work, we investigate the robustness of multimodal classifiers to cross-modal dilutions - a plausible variation. We develop a model that, given a multimodal (image + text) input, generates additional dilution text that (a) maintains relevance and topical coherence with the image and existing text, and (b) when added to the original text, leads to misclassification of the multimodal input. Via experiments on Crisis Humanitarianism and Sentiment Detection tasks, we find that the performance of task-specific fusion-based multimodal classifiers drops by 23.3% and 22.5%, respectively, in the presence of dilutions generated by our model. Metric-based comparisons with several baselines and human evaluations indicate that our dilutions show higher relevance and topical coherence, while simultaneously being more effective at demonstrating the brittleness of the multimodal classifiers. Our work aims to highlight and encourage further research on the robustness of deep multimodal models to realistic variations, especially in human-facing societal applications.

In contrast to current approaches that predict a set of discrete candidate grasps, the distance-based NGDF representation is easily interpreted as a cost, and minimizing this cost produces a successful grasp pose. This grasp distance cost can be incorporated directly into a trajectory optimizer for joint optimization with other costs such as trajectory smoothness and collision avoidance. During optimization, as the various costs are balanced and minimized, the grasp target is allowed to smoothly vary, as the learned grasp field is continuous. In simulation benchmarks with a Franka arm, we find that joint grasping and planning with NGDF outperforms baselines by 63% execution success while generalizing to unseen query poses and unseen object shapes.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) leverages both labeled and unlabeled data for training models when the labeled data is limited and the unlabeled data is vast. Frequently, the unlabeled data is more widely available than the labeled data, hence this data is used to improve the level of generalization of a model when the labeled data is scarce. However, in real-world settings unlabeled data might depict a different distribution than the labeled dataset distribution. This is known as distribution mismatch. Such problem generally occurs when the source of unlabeled data is different from the labeled data. For instance, in the medical imaging domain, when training a COVID-19 detector using chest X-ray images, different unlabeled datasets sampled from different hospitals might be used. In this work, we propose an automatic thresholding method to filter out-of-distribution data in the unlabeled dataset. We use the Mahalanobis distance between the labeled and unlabeled datasets using the feature space built by a pre-trained Image-net Feature Extractor (FE) to score each unlabeled observation. We test two simple automatic thresholding methods in the context of training a COVID-19 detector using chest X-ray images.

Over the years, high cadence microlensing surveys have amassed several terabytes of data while scanning primarily the Galactic Bulge and Magellanic Clouds for microlensing events and thus provide a treasure trove of opportunities for scientific data mining. In particular, numerous asteroids have been observed by visual inspection of selected images. This paper presents novel deep learning-based solutions for the recovery and discovery of asteroids in the microlensing data gathered by the MOA project. Asteroid tracklets can be clearly seen by combining all the observations on a given night and these tracklets inform the structure of the dataset. Known asteroids were identified within these composite images and used for creating the labelled datasets required for supervised learning. Several custom CNN models were developed to identify images with asteroid tracklets. Model ensembling was then employed to reduce the variance in the predictions as well as to improve the generalisation error, achieving a recall of 97.67%. Furthermore, the YOLOv4 object detector was trained to localize asteroid tracklets, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 90.97%. These trained networks will be applied to 16 years of MOA archival data to find both known and unknown asteroids that have been observed by the survey over the years. The methodologies developed can be adapted for use by other surveys for asteroid recovery and discovery. ",

    "abstract": "Achieving accurate and automated tumor segmentation plays an important role in both clinical practice and radiomics research. Segmentation in medicine is now often performed manually by experts, which is a laborious, expensive and error-prone task. Manual annotation relies heavily on the experience and knowledge of these experts. In addition, there is much intra- and interobserver variation. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a method that can automatically segment tumor target regions. In this paper, we propose a deep learning segmentation method based on multimodal positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), which combines the high sensitivity of PET and the precise anatomical information of CT. We design an improved spatial attention network(ISA-Net) to increase the accuracy of PET or CT in detecting tumors, which uses multi-scale convolution operation to extract feature information and can highlight the tumor region location information and suppress the non-tumor region location information. In addition, our network uses dual-channel inputs in the coding stage and fuses them in the decoding stage, which can take advantage of the differences and complementarities between PET and CT. We validated the proposed ISA-Net method on two clinical datasets, a soft tissue sarcoma(STS) and a head and neck tumor(HECKTOR) dataset, and compared with other attention methods for tumor segmentation. The DSC score of 0.8378 on STS dataset and 0.8076 on HECKTOR dataset show that ISA-Net method achieves better segmentation performance and has better generalization. Conclusions: The method proposed in this paper is based on multi-modal medical image tumor segmentation, which can effectively utilize the difference and complementarity of different modes. The method can also be applied to other multi-modal data or single-modal data by proper adjustment. ",

    "abstract": "The detection of earthquakes is a fundamental prerequisite for seismology and contributes to various research areas, such as forecasting earthquakes and understanding the crust/mantle structure. Recent advances in machine learning technologies have enabled the automatic detection of earthquakes from waveform data. In particular, various state-of-the-art deep-learning methods have been applied to this endeavour. In this study, we proposed and tested a novel phase detection method employing deep learning, which is based on a standard convolutional neural network in a new framework. The novelty of the proposed method is its separate explicit learning strategy for global and local representations of waveforms, which enhances its robustness and flexibility. Prior to modelling the proposed method, we identified local representations of the waveform by the multiple clustering of waveforms, in which the data points were optimally partitioned. Based on this result, we considered a global representation and two local representations of the waveform. Subsequently, different phase detection models were trained for each global and local representation. For a new waveform, the overall phase probability was evaluated as a product of the phase probabilities of each model. This additional information on local representations makes the proposed method robust to noise, which is demonstrated by its application to the test data. Furthermore, an application to seismic swarm data demonstrated the robust performance of the proposed method compared with those of other deep learning methods. Finally, in an application to low-frequency earthquakes, we demonstrated the flexibility of the proposed method, which is readily adaptable for the detection of low-frequency earthquakes by retraining only a local model.

However, most of these studies are still based on the temporal correlation between the sources and voxel signals, and lack of researches on the dynamics of brain function. Due to the widespread local correlations in the volumes, FBNs can be generated directly in the spatial domain in a self-supervised manner by using spatial-wise attention (SA), and the resulting FBNs has a higher spatial similarity with templates compared to the classical method. Therefore, we proposed a novel Spatial-Temporal Convolutional Attention (STCA) model to discover the dynamic FBNs by using the sliding windows. To validate the performance of the proposed method, we evaluate the approach on HCP-rest dataset. The results indicate that STCA can be used to discover FBNs in a dynamic way which provide a novel approach to better understand human brain. ",

    "title": "Fighting the scanner effect in brain MRI segmentation with a progressive  level-of-detail network trained on multi-site data",
    "abstract": "Many clinical and research studies of the human brain require an accurate structural MRI segmentation. While traditional atlas-based methods can be applied to volumes from any acquisition site, recent deep learning algorithms ensure very high accuracy only when tested on data from the same sites exploited in training (i.e., internal data). The performance degradation experienced on external data (i.e., unseen volumes from unseen sites) is due to the inter-site variabilities in intensity distributions induced by different MR scanner models, acquisition parameters, and unique artefacts. To mitigate this site-dependency, often referred to as the scanner effect, we propose LOD-Brain, a 3D convolutional neural network with progressive levels-of-detail (LOD) able to segment brain data from any site. Coarser network levels are responsible to learn a robust anatomical prior useful for identifying brain structures and their locations, while finer levels refine the model to handle site-specific intensity distributions and anatomical variations. We ensure robustness across sites by training the model on an unprecedented rich dataset aggregating data from open repositories: almost 27,000 T1w volumes from around 160 acquisition sites, at 1.5 - 3T, from a population spanning from 8 to 90 years old. Extensive tests demonstrate that LOD-Brain produces state-of-the-art results, with no significant difference in performance between internal and external sites, and robust to challenging anatomical variations. Its portability opens the way for large scale application across different healthcare institutions, patient populations, and imaging technology manufacturers. Code, model, and demo are available at the project website. ",

Popular loss functions, including the cross-entropy and dice losses, often fall short of boundary detection, thereby limiting high-resolution downstream applications such as automated diagnoses and procedures. We developed a novel loss function that is tailored to reflect the boundary information to enhance the boundary detection. As the contrast between segmentation and background regions along the classification boundary naturally induces heterogeneity over the pixels, we propose the piece-wise two-sample t-test augmented (PTA) loss that is infused with the statistical test for such heterogeneity. We demonstrate the improved boundary detection power of the PTA loss compared to benchmark losses without a t-test component. ",

In this paper, we present an SRO estimation and compensation method to allow the deployment of the distributed adaptive node-specific signal estimation (DANSE) algorithm in WASNs composed of asynchronous devices. The signals available at each node are first utilised in a coherence-drift-based method to blindly estimate SROs which are then compensated for via phase shifts in the frequency domain. A modification of the weighted overlap-add (WOLA) implementation of DANSE is introduced to account for SRO-induced full-sample drifts, permitting per-sample signal transmission via an approximation of the WOLA process as a time-domain convolution. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in the context of distributed noise reduction for the estimation of a target speech signal in an asynchronous WASN. ",

This paper introduces additional coding efficiency in neural speech coding by reducing the temporal redundancy existing in the frame-level feature sequence via a recurrent neural predictor. The prediction can achieve a low-entropy residual representation, which we discriminatively code based on their contribution to the signal reconstruction. The harmonization of feature prediction and discriminative coding results in a dynamic bit allocation algorithm that spends more bits on unpredictable but rare events. As a result, we develop a scalable, lightweight, low-latency, and low-bitrate neural speech coding system. We demonstrate the advantage of the proposed methods using the LPCNet as a neural vocoder. While the proposed method guarantees causality in its prediction, the subjective tests and feature space analysis show that our model achieves superior coding efficiency compared to LPCNet and Lyra V2 in the very low bitrates.

In this paper, we propose a denoising vocoder (DeVo) approach, where a vocoder accepts noisy representations and learns to directly synthesize clean speech. We leverage rich representations from self-supervised learning (SSL) speech models to discover relevant features. We conduct a candidate search across 15 potential SSL front-ends and subsequently train our vocoder adversarially with the best SSL configuration. Additionally, we demonstrate a causal version capable of running on streaming audio with 10ms latency and minimal performance degradation. Finally, we conduct both objective evaluations and subjective listening studies to show our system improves objective metrics and outperforms an existing state-of-the-art SE model subjectively. ",

Traditional intrusive speech quality assessment requires the clean reference of the degraded utterance to provide an accurate quality measurement. This requirement limits the usability of these methods in real-world scenarios.

In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end model structure called Convolutional Context-Aware Transformer (CCAT) network to predict the mean opinion score (MOS) of human raters. We evaluate our model on three MOS-annotated datasets spanning multiple languages and distortion types and submit our results to the ConferencingSpeech 2022 Challenge. Our experiments show that CCAT provides promising MOS predictions compared to current state-of-art non-intrusive speech assessment models with average Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) increasing from 0.530 to 0.697 and average RMSE decreasing from 0.768 to 0.570 compared to the baseline model on the challenge evaluation test set.

In this context, the main focus of recent literature was on development of different Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based architectures that perform Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR) at a macroscopic level (i.e., directly from sEMG signals). At the same time, advancements in acquisition of High-Density sEMG signals (HD-sEMG) have resulted in a surge of significant interest on sEMG decomposition techniques to extract microscopic neural drive information. However, due to complexities of sEMG decomposition and added computational overhead, HGR at microscopic level is less explored than its aforementioned DNN-based counterparts. In this regard, we propose the HYDRA-HGR framework, which is a hybrid model that simultaneously extracts a set of temporal and spatial features through its two independent Vision Transformer (ViT)-based parallel architectures (the so called Macro and Micro paths). The Macro Path is trained directly on the pre-processed HD-sEMG signals, while the Micro path is fed with the p-to-p values of the extracted Motor Unit Action Potentials (MUAPs) of each source. Extracted features at macroscopic and microscopic levels are then coupled via a Fully Connected (FC) fusion layer. We evaluate the proposed hybrid HYDRA-HGR framework through a recently released HD-sEMG dataset, and show that it significantly outperforms its stand-alone counterparts. The proposed HYDRA-HGR framework achieves average accuracy of 94.86% for the 250 ms window size, which is 5.52% and 8.22% higher than that of the Macro and Micro paths, respectively. ",

The MI-EEG classifiers' tendency has changed fundamentally over the past twenty years, while classifiers' performance is gradually increasing. In particular, owing to the need for characterizing signals' non-Euclidean inherence, the first geometric deep learning (GDL) framework, Tensor-CSPNet, has recently emerged in the BCI study. In essence, Tensor-CSPNet is a deep learning-based classifier on the second-order statistics of EEGs. In contrast to the first-order statistics, using these second-order statistics is the classical treatment of EEG signals, and the discriminative information contained in these second-order statistics is adequate for MI-EEG classification. In this study, we present another GDL classifier for MI-EEG classification called Graph-CSPNet, using graph-based techniques to simultaneously characterize the EEG signals in both the time and frequency domains. It is realized from the perspective of the time-frequency analysis that profoundly influences signal processing and BCI studies. Contrary to Tensor-CSPNet, the architecture of Graph-CSPNet is further simplified with more flexibility to cope with variable time-frequency resolution for signal segmentation to capture the localized fluctuations. In the experiments, Graph-CSPNet is evaluated on subject-specific scenarios from two well-used MI-EEG datasets and produces near-optimal classification accuracies. ",
