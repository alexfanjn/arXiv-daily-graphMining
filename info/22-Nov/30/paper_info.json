    "abstract": "Different from the general visual classification, some classification tasks are more challenging as they need the professional categories of the images. In the paper, we call them expert-level classification. Previous fine-grained vision classification (FGVC) has made many efforts on some of its specific sub-tasks. However, they are difficult to expand to the general cases which rely on the comprehensive analysis of part-global correlation and the hierarchical features interaction. In this paper, we propose Expert Network (ExpNet) to address the unique challenges of expert-level classification through a unified network. In ExpNet, we hierarchically decouple the part and context features and individually process them using a novel attentive mechanism, called Gaze-Shift. In each stage, Gaze-Shift produces a focal-part feature for the subsequent abstraction and memorizes a context-related embedding. Then we fuse the final focal embedding with all memorized context-related embedding to make the prediction. Such an architecture realizes the dual-track processing of partial and global information and hierarchical feature interactions. We conduct the experiments over three representative expert-level classification tasks: FGVC, disease classification, and artwork attributes classification. In these experiments, superior performance of our ExpNet is observed comparing to the state-of-the-arts in a wide range of fields, indicating the effectiveness and generalization of our ExpNet. The code will be made publicly available. ",

    "title": "Direct Heterogeneous Causal Learning for Resource Allocation Problems in  Marketing",
    "abstract": "Marketing is an important mechanism to increase user engagement and improve platform revenue, and heterogeneous causal learning can help develop more effective strategies. Most decision-making problems in marketing can be formulated as resource allocation problems and have been studied for decades. Existing works usually divide the solution procedure into two fully decoupled stages, i.e., machine learning (ML) and operation research (OR) -- the first stage predicts the model parameters and they are fed to the optimization in the second stage. However, the error of the predicted parameters in ML cannot be respected and a series of complex mathematical operations in OR lead to the increased accumulative errors. Essentially, the improved precision on the prediction parameters may not have a positive correlation on the final solution due to the side-effect from the decoupled design. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for solving resource allocation problems to mitigate the side-effects. Our key intuition is that we introduce the decision factor to establish a bridge between ML and OR such that the solution can be directly obtained in OR by only performing the sorting or comparison operations on the decision factor. Furthermore, we design a customized loss function that can conduct direct heterogeneous causal learning on the decision factor, an unbiased estimation of which can be guaranteed when the loss converges. As a case study, we apply our approach to two crucial problems in marketing: the binary treatment assignment problem and the budget allocation problem with multiple treatments. Both large-scale simulations and online A/B Tests demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvement compared with state-of-the-art. ",

Independent System Operators (ISOs) also aim at using finer time granularities, longer time horizons, and possibly stochastic formulations for additional economic and reliability benefits. The goal of this paper is to address the computational challenges arising in extending the scope of RAC formulations. It presents RACLEARN that (1) uses Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict generator commitments and active line constraints, (2) associates a confidence value to each commitment prediction, (3) selects a subset of the high-confidence predictions, which are (4) repaired for feasibility, and (5) seeds a state-of-the-art optimization algorithm with the feasible predictions and the active constraints. Experimental results on exact RAC formulations used by the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) and an actual transmission network (8965 transmission lines, 6708 buses, 1890 generators, and 6262 load units) show that the RACLEARN framework can speed up RAC optimization by factors ranging from 2 to 4 with negligible loss in solution quality.

    "abstract": "While it has long been empirically observed that adversarial robustness may be at odds with standard accuracy and may have further disparate impacts on different classes, it remains an open question to what extent such observations hold and how the class imbalance plays a role within. In this paper, we attempt to understand this question of accuracy disparity by taking a closer look at linear classifiers under a Gaussian mixture model. We decompose the impact of adversarial robustness into two parts: an inherent effect that will degrade the standard accuracy on all classes, and the other caused by the class imbalance ratio, which will increase the accuracy disparity compared to standard training. Furthermore, we also extend our model to the general family of stable distributions. We demonstrate that while the constraint of adversarial robustness consistently degrades the standard accuracy in the balanced class setting, the class imbalance ratio plays a fundamentally different role in accuracy disparity compared to the Gaussian case, due to the heavy tail of the stable distribution. We additionally perform experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The empirical results not only corroborate our theoretical findings, but also suggest that the implications may extend to nonlinear models over real-world datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in text mining and natural language processing technology have enabled researchers to detect an authors identity or demographic characteristics, such as age and gender, in several text genres by automatically analysing the variation of linguistic characteristics. However, applying such techniques in the wild, i.e., in both cybercriminal and regular online social media, differs from more general applications in that its defining characteristics are both domain and process dependent. This gives rise to a number of challenges of which contemporary research has only scratched the surface. More specifically, a text mining approach applied on social media communications typically has no control over the dataset size, the number of available communications will vary across users. Hence, the system has to be robust towards limited data availability. Additionally, the quality of the data cannot be guaranteed. As a result, the approach needs to be tolerant to a certain degree of linguistic noise (for example, abbreviations, non-standard language use, spelling variations and errors). Finally, in the context of cybercriminal fora, it has to be robust towards deceptive or adversarial behaviour, i.e. offenders who attempt to hide their criminal intentions (obfuscation) or who assume a false digital persona (imitation), potentially using coded language. In this work we present a comprehensive survey that discusses the problems that have already been addressed in current literature and review potential solutions. Additionally, we highlight which areas need to be given more attention. ",

While numerous neural EA models have been devised, they are mainly learned using labelled data only. In this work, we argue that different entities within one KG should have compatible counterparts in the other KG due to the potential dependencies among the entities. Making compatible predictions thus should be one of the goals of training an EA model along with fitting the labelled data: this aspect however is neglected in current methods. To power neural EA models with compatibility, we devise a training framework by addressing three problems: (1) how to measure the compatibility of an EA model; (2) how to inject the property of being compatible into an EA model; (3) how to optimise parameters of the compatibility model. Extensive experiments on widely-used datasets demonstrate the advantages of integrating compatibility within EA models. In fact, state-of-the-art neural EA models trained within our framework using just 5\\% of the labelled data can achieve comparable effectiveness with supervised training using 20\\% of the labelled data.

    "abstract": "Pre-trained code generation models (PCGMs) have been widely applied in neural code generation which can generate executable code from functional descriptions in natural languages, possibly together with signatures. Despite substantial performance improvement of PCGMs, the role of method names in neural code generation has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we study and demonstrate the potential of benefiting from method names to enhance the performance of PCGMs, from a model robustness perspective. Specifically, we propose a novel approach, named RADAR (neuRAl coDe generAtor Robustifier). RADAR consists of two components: RADAR-Attack and RADAR-Defense. The former attacks a PCGM by generating adversarial method names as part of the input, which are semantic and visual similar to the original input, but may trick the PCGM to generate completely unrelated code snippets. As a countermeasure to such attacks, RADAR-Defense synthesizes a new method name from the functional description and supplies it to the PCGM. Evaluation results show that RADAR-Attack can, e.g., reduce the CodeBLEU of generated code by 19.72% to 38.74% in three state-of-the-art PCGMs (i.e., CodeGPT, PLBART, and CodeT5). Moreover, RADAR-Defense is able to reinstate the performance of PCGMs with synthesized method names. These results highlight the importance of good method names in neural code generation and implicate the benefits of studying model robustness in software engineering. ",

Consequently, new facts and previously unseen entities and relations continually emerge, necessitating an embedding model that can quickly learn and transfer new knowledge through growth. Motivated by this, we delve into an expanding field of KG embedding in this paper, i.e., lifelong KG embedding. We consider knowledge transfer and retention of the learning on growing snapshots of a KG without having to learn embeddings from scratch. The proposed model includes a masked KG autoencoder for embedding learning and update, with an embedding transfer strategy to inject the learned knowledge into the new entity and relation embeddings, and an embedding regularization method to avoid catastrophic forgetting. To investigate the impacts of different aspects of KG growth, we construct four datasets to evaluate the performance of lifelong KG embedding. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art inductive and lifelong embedding baselines. ",

In these operations, search efficiency in terms of the amount of time spent to find the target is crucial since with the passing of time the survivability of the missing person decreases or wildfire management becomes more difficult with disastrous consequences. In this work, it is considered a scenario where a drone is intended to search and detect a missing person (e.g., a hiker or a mountaineer) or a potential fire spot in a given area. In order to obtain the shortest path to the target, a general framework is provided to model the problem of target detection when the target's location is probabilistically known. To this end, two algorithms are proposed: Path planning and target detection. The path planning algorithm is based on Bayesian inference and the target detection is accomplished by means of a residual neural network (ResNet) trained on the image dataset captured by the drone as well as existing pictures and datasets on the web. Through simulation and experiment, the proposed path planning algorithm is compared with two benchmark algorithms. It is shown that the proposed algorithm significantly decreases the average time of the mission. ",

The proposed method augments the architecture of a conventional DNN by an instance-dependent permutation layer. This layer is essentially a convex combination of permutation matrices that is dynamically calibrated for each sample. The primary objective of the permutation layer is to correct the loss of noisy samples mitigating the effect of label noise. We provide two variants of PermLL in this paper: one applies the permutation layer to the model's prediction, while the other applies it directly to the given noisy label. In addition, we provide a theoretical comparison between the two variants and show that previous methods can be seen as one of the variants. Finally, we validate PermLL experimentally and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on both real and synthetic datasets. ",

Moreover, methods are usually evaluated on a small number of generally well-behaved time series, which does not show their ability to generalize.

However, in a link prediction task, links in the training set are always present while ones in the testing set are not yet formed, resulting in a discrepancy of the connectivity pattern and bias of the learned representation. It leads to a problem of dataset shift which degrades the model performance. In this paper, we first identify the dataset shift problem in the link prediction task and provide theoretical analyses on how existing link prediction methods are vulnerable to it. We then propose FakeEdge, a model-agnostic technique, to address the problem by mitigating the graph topological gap between training and testing sets.

    "abstract": "Neural network interpretation methods, particularly feature attribution methods, are known to be fragile with respect to adversarial input perturbations. To address this, several methods for enhancing the local smoothness of the gradient while training have been proposed for attaining \\textit{robust} feature attributions. However, the lack of considering the normalization of the attributions, which is essential in their visualizations, has been an obstacle to understanding and improving the robustness of feature attribution methods. In this paper, we provide new insights by taking such normalization into account. First, we show that for every non-negative homogeneous neural network, a naive $\\ell_2$-robust criterion for gradients is \\textit{not} normalization invariant, which means that two functions with the same normalized gradient can have different values. Second, we formulate a normalization invariant cosine distance-based criterion and derive its upper bound, which gives insight for why simply minimizing the Hessian norm at the input, as has been done in previous work, is not sufficient for attaining robust feature attribution. Finally, we propose to combine both $\\ell_2$ and cosine distance-based criteria as regularization terms to leverage the advantages of both in aligning the local gradient. As a result, we experimentally show that models trained with our method produce much more robust interpretations on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 without significantly hurting the accuracy, compared to the recent baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to verify the robustness of interpretation on a larger-scale dataset beyond CIFAR-10, thanks to the computational efficiency of our method. ",

    "title": "Equivalence Between SE(3) Equivariant Networks via Steerable Kernels and  Group Convolution",
    "abstract": "A wide range of techniques have been proposed in recent years for designing neural networks for 3D data that are equivariant under rotation and translation of the input. Most approaches for equivariance under the Euclidean group $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ of rotations and translations fall within one of the two major categories. The first category consists of methods that use $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$-convolution which generalizes classical $\\mathbb{R}^3$-convolution on signals over $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$. Alternatively, it is possible to use \\textit{steerable convolution} which achieves $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$-equivariance by imposing constraints on $\\mathbb{R}^3$-convolution of tensor fields. It is known by specialists in the field that the two approaches are equivalent, with steerable convolution being the Fourier transform of $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ convolution. Unfortunately, these results are not widely known and moreover the exact relations between deep learning architectures built upon these two approaches have not been precisely described in the literature on equivariant deep learning. In this work we provide an in-depth analysis of both methods and their equivalence and relate the two constructions to multiview convolutional networks. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justifications of separability of $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$ group convolution, which explain the applicability and success of some recent approaches. Finally, we express different methods using a single coherent formalism and provide explicit formulas that relate the kernels learned by different methods. In this way, our work helps to unify different previously-proposed techniques for achieving roto-translational equivariance, and helps to shed light on both the utility and precise differences between various alternatives. We also derive new TFN non-linearities from our equivalence principle and test them on practical benchmark datasets. ",

    "abstract": "While person Re-identification (Re-ID) has progressed rapidly due to its wide real-world applications, it also causes severe risks of leaking personal information from training data. Thus, this paper focuses on quantifying this risk by membership inference (MI) attack. Most of the existing MI attack algorithms focus on classification models, while Re-ID follows a totally different training and inference paradigm. Re-ID is a fine-grained recognition task with complex feature embedding, and model outputs commonly used by existing MI like logits and losses are not accessible during inference. Since Re-ID focuses on modelling the relative relationship between image pairs instead of individual semantics, we conduct a formal and empirical analysis which validates that the distribution shift of the inter-sample similarity between training and test set is a critical criterion for Re-ID membership inference. As a result, we propose a novel membership inference attack method based on the inter-sample similarity distribution. Specifically, a set of anchor images are sampled to represent the similarity distribution conditioned on a target image, and a neural network with a novel anchor selection module is proposed to predict the membership of the target image. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both the Re-ID task and conventional classification task. ",

    "title": "Weakly Supervised Learning Significantly Reduces the Number of Labels  Required for Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection on Head CT",
    "abstract": "Modern machine learning pipelines, in particular those based on deep learning (DL) models, require large amounts of labeled data. For classification problems, the most common learning paradigm consists of presenting labeled examples during training, thus providing strong supervision on what constitutes positive and negative samples. This constitutes a major obstacle for the development of DL models in radiology--in particular for cross-sectional imaging (e.g., computed tomography [CT] scans)--where labels must come from manual annotations by expert radiologists at the image or slice-level. These differ from examination-level annotations, which are coarser but cheaper, and could be extracted from radiology reports using natural language processing techniques. This work studies the question of what kind of labels should be collected for the problem of intracranial hemorrhage detection in brain CT. We investigate whether image-level annotations should be preferred to examination-level ones. By framing this task as a multiple instance learning problem, and employing modern attention-based DL architectures, we analyze the degree to which different levels of supervision improve detection performance. We find that strong supervision (i.e., learning with local image-level annotations) and weak supervision (i.e., learning with only global examination-level labels) achieve comparable performance in examination-level hemorrhage detection (the task of selecting the images in an examination that show signs of hemorrhage) as well as in image-level hemorrhage detection (highlighting those signs within the selected images). Furthermore, we study this behavior as a function of the number of labels available during training. Our results suggest that local labels may not be necessary at all for these tasks, drastically reducing the time and cost involved in collecting and curating datasets. ",

As these tables rely on data interpolation, this work explores the open questions about their fidelity in relation to the stochastic device behavior they model. We study how various jump table device models impact the attained network performance estimates, a concept we define as modeling bias. Two methods of jump table device modeling, binning and Optuna-optimized binning, are explored using synthetic data with known distributions for benchmarking purposes, as well as experimental data obtained from TiOx ReRAM devices. Results on a multi-layer perceptron trained on MNIST show that device models based on binning can behave unpredictably particularly at low number of points in the device dataset, sometimes over-promising, sometimes under-promising target network accuracy. This paper also proposes device level metrics that indicate similar trends with the modeling bias metric at the network level. The proposed approach opens the possibility for future investigations into statistical device models with better performance, as well as experimentally verified modeling bias in different in-memory computing and neural network architectures.

For exploring how this high performance relates to the proper use of data artifacts and the accurate problem formulation of a given task, interpretation models have become a crucial component in developing deep learning-based systems. Interpretation models enable the understanding of the inner workings of deep learning models and offer a sense of security in detecting the misuse of artifacts in the input data. Similar to prediction models, interpretation models are also susceptible to adversarial inputs. This work introduces two attacks, AdvEdge and AdvEdge$^{+}$, that deceive both the target deep learning model and the coupled interpretation model. We assess the effectiveness of proposed attacks against two deep learning model architectures coupled with four interpretation models that represent different categories of interpretation models. Our experiments include the attack implementation using various attack frameworks. We also explore the potential countermeasures against such attacks. Our analysis shows the effectiveness of our attacks in terms of deceiving the deep learning models and their interpreters, and highlights insights to improve and circumvent the attacks. ",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of computing an approximate Nash equilibrium of continuous-action game without access to gradients. Such game access is common in reinforcement learning settings, where the environment is typically treated as a black box. To tackle this problem, we apply zeroth-order optimization techniques that combine smoothed gradient estimators with equilibrium-finding dynamics. We model players' strategies using artificial neural networks. In particular, we use randomized policy networks to model mixed strategies. These take noise in addition to an observation as input and can flexibly represent arbitrary observation-dependent, continuous-action distributions. Being able to model such mixed strategies is crucial for tackling continuous-action games that lack pure-strategy equilibria. We evaluate the performance of our method using an approximation of the Nash convergence metric from game theory, which measures how much players can benefit from unilaterally changing their strategy. We apply our method to continuous Colonel Blotto games, single-item and multi-item auctions, and a visibility game. The experiments show that our method can quickly find high-quality approximate equilibria. Furthermore, they show that the dimensionality of the input noise is crucial for performance. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to solve general continuous-action games with unrestricted mixed strategies and without any gradient information. ",

Many existing algorithmic audits examine the performance of these systems on later stage elements of facial analysis systems like facial recognition and age, emotion, or perceived gender prediction; however, a core component to these systems has been vastly understudied from a fairness perspective: face detection, sometimes called face localization. Since face detection is a pre-requisite step in facial analysis systems, the bias we observe in face detection will flow downstream to the other components like facial recognition and emotion prediction. Additionally, no prior work has focused on the robustness of these systems under various perturbations and corruptions, which leaves open the question of how various people are impacted by these phenomena. We present the first of its kind detailed benchmark of face detection systems, specifically examining the robustness to noise of commercial and academic models. We use both standard and recently released academic facial datasets to quantitatively analyze trends in face detection robustness. Across all the datasets and systems, we generally find that photos of individuals who are $\\textit{masculine presenting}$, $\\textit{older}$, of $\\textit{darker skin type}$, or have $\\textit{dim lighting}$ are more susceptible to errors than their counterparts in other identities.

Previous SVS studies have mainly employed the spectrogram masking method which requires a large dimensionality in predicting the binary masks. In addition, they focused on extracting a vocal stem that retains the wet sound with the reverberation effect. This result may hinder the reusability of the isolated singing voice. This paper addresses the issues by predicting mel-spectrogram of dry singing voices from the mixed audio as neural vocoder features and synthesizing the singing voice waveforms from the neural vocoder. We experimented with two separation methods. One is predicting binary masks in the mel-spectrogram domain and the other is directly predicting the mel-spectrogram. Furthermore, we add a singing voice detector to identify the singing voice segments over time more explicitly. We measured the model performance in terms of audio, dereverberation, separation, and overall quality. The results show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art singing voice separation models in both objective and subjective evaluation except the audio quality. ",

PINO uses the Fourier neural operator (FNO) architecture to overcome the optimization challenges often faced by physics-informed neural networks. Since the convolution operator in PINO uses the Fourier series representation, its gradient can be computed exactly on the Fourier space. While Fourier series cannot represent nonperiodic functions, PINO and FNO still have the expressivity to learn nonperiodic problems with Fourier extension via padding. However, computing the Fourier extension in the physics-informed optimization requires solving an ill-conditioned system, resulting in inaccurate derivatives which prevent effective optimization. In this work, we present an architecture that leverages Fourier continuation (FC) to apply the exact gradient method to PINO for nonperiodic problems. This paper investigates three different ways that FC can be incorporated into PINO by testing their performance on a 1D blowup problem. Experiments show that FC-PINO outperforms padded PINO, improving equation loss by several orders of magnitude, and it can accurately capture the third order derivatives of nonsmooth solution functions.

Common mitigation strategies include transfer learning, over-sampling, and under-sampling, yet these ad-hoc methods only provide limited performance boost that varies from one case to another. In this work, we introduce one variant of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), named the balanced semi-supervised GAN (BSS-GAN). It adopts the semi-supervised learning concept and applies balanced-batch sampling in training to resolve low-data and imbalanced-class problems. A series of computer experiments on concrete cracking and spalling classification were conducted under the low-data imbalanced-class regime with limited computing power.

    "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods have proved effective as compact, high-quality and versatile representations for 3D scenes, and enable downstream tasks such as editing, retrieval, navigation, etc. Various neural architectures are vying for the core structure of NeRF, including the plain Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), sparse tensors, low-rank tensors, hashtables and their compositions. Each of these representations has its particular set of trade-offs. For example, the hashtable-based representations admit faster training and rendering but their lack of clear geometric meaning hampers downstream tasks like spatial-relation-aware editing. In this paper, we propose Progressive Volume Distillation (PVD), a systematic distillation method that allows any-to-any conversions between different architectures, including MLP, sparse or low-rank tensors, hashtables and their compositions. PVD consequently empowers downstream applications to optimally adapt the neural representations for the task at hand in a post hoc fashion. The conversions are fast, as distillation is progressively performed on different levels of volume representations, from shallower to deeper. We also employ special treatment of density to deal with its specific numerical instability problem. Empirical evidence is presented to validate our method on the NeRF-Synthetic, LLFF and TanksAndTemples datasets. For example, with PVD, an MLP-based NeRF model can be distilled from a hashtable-based Instant-NGP model at a 10X~20X faster speed than being trained the original NeRF from scratch, while achieving a superior level of synthesis quality.

In this paper, we introduce a new structure-preserving deep learning architecture, the Lie group Forced Variational Integrator Network (LieFVIN), capable of learning controlled Lagrangian or Hamiltonian dynamics on Lie groups, either from position-velocity or position-only data. By design, LieFVINs preserve both the Lie group structure on which the dynamics evolve and the symplectic structure underlying the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian systems of interest. The proposed architecture learns surrogate discrete-time flow maps instead of surrogate vector fields, which allows better and faster prediction without requiring the use of a numerical integrator, neural ODE, or adjoint techniques. Furthermore, the learnt discrete-time dynamics can be combined seamlessly with computationally scalable discrete-time (optimal) control strategies. ",

    "title": "PatchMix Augmentation to Identify Causal Features in Few-shot Learning",
    "abstract": "The task of Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to transfer the knowledge learned from base categories with sufficient labelled data to novel categories with scarce known information. It is currently an important research question and has great practical values in the real-world applications. Despite extensive previous efforts are made on few-shot learning tasks, we emphasize that most existing methods did not take into account the distributional shift caused by sample selection bias in the FSL scenario. Such a selection bias can induce spurious correlation between the semantic causal features, that are causally and semantically related to the class label, and the other non-causal features. Critically, the former ones should be invariant across changes in distributions, highly related to the classes of interest, and thus well generalizable to novel classes, while the latter ones are not stable to changes in the distribution. To resolve this problem, we propose a novel data augmentation strategy dubbed as PatchMix that can break this spurious dependency by replacing the patch-level information and supervision of the query images with random gallery images from different classes from the query ones. We theoretically show that such an augmentation mechanism, different from existing ones, is able to identify the causal features. To further make these features to be discriminative enough for classification, we propose Correlation-guided Reconstruction (CGR) and Hardness-Aware module for instance discrimination and easier discrimination between similar classes. Moreover, such a framework can be adapted to the unsupervised FSL scenario. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a robust election simulation model and independently developed election anomaly detection algorithm that demonstrates the simulation's utility. The simulation generates artificial elections with similar properties and trends as elections from the real world, while giving users control and knowledge over all the important components of the elections. We generate a clean election results dataset without fraud as well as datasets with varying degrees of fraud. We then measure how well the algorithm is able to successfully detect the level of fraud present. The algorithm determines how similar actual election results are as compared to the predicted results from polling and a regression model of other regions that have similar demographics. We use k-means to partition electoral regions into clusters such that demographic homogeneity is maximized among clusters. We then use a novelty detection algorithm implemented as a one-class Support Vector Machine where the clean data is provided in the form of polling predictions and regression predictions. The regression predictions are built from the actual data in such a way that the data supervises itself. We show both the effectiveness of the simulation technique and the machine learning model in its success in identifying fraudulent regions. ",

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is a widely used technique for enhancing the generalization ability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks. Occlusion is a critical factor that affects on the generalization ability of image classification models. In order to generate new samples, existing data augmentation methods based on information deletion simulate occluded samples by randomly removing some areas in the images. However, those methods cannot delete areas of the images according to their structural features of the images. To solve those problems, we propose a novel data augmentation method, AdvMask, for image classification tasks. Instead of randomly removing areas in the images, AdvMask obtains the key points that have the greatest influence on the classification results via an end-to-end sparse adversarial attack module. Therefore, we can find the most sensitive points of the classification results without considering the diversity of various image appearance and shapes of the object of interest. In addition, a data augmentation module is employed to generate structured masks based on the key points, thus forcing the CNN classification models to seek other relevant content when the most discriminative content is hidden. AdvMask can effectively improve the performance of classification models in the testing process. The experimental results on various datasets and CNN models verify that the proposed method outperforms other previous data augmentation methods in image classification tasks. ",

In the first stage, SSL is conducted on the large-scale unlabeled corpus to pre-train a small speech model. Secondly, we actively sample a small portion of clips from the unlabeled corpus and query the target model with these clips to acquire their representations as labels for the small model's second-stage training.

    "abstract": "We are interested in neurosymbolic systems consisting of a high-level symbolic layer for explainable prediction in terms of human-intelligible concepts; and a low-level neural layer for extracting symbols required to generate the symbolic explanation. Real data is often imperfect meaning that even if the symbolic theory remains unchanged, we may still need to address the problem of mapping raw data to high-level symbols, each time there is a change in the data acquisition environment or equipment. Manual (re-)annotation of the raw data each time this happens is laborious and expensive; and automated labelling methods are often imperfect, especially for complex problems. NEUROLOG proposed the use of a semantic loss function that allows an existing feature-based symbolic model to guide the extraction of feature-values from raw data, using `abduction'. However, the experiments demonstrating the use of semantic loss through abduction appear to rely heavily on a domain-specific pre-processing step that enables a prior delineation of feature locations in the raw data. We examine the use of semantic loss in domains where such pre-processing is not possible, or is not obvious. We show that without any prior information about the features, the NEUROLOG approach can continue to predict accurately even with substantially incorrect feature predictions. We show also that prior information about the features in the form of even imperfect pre-training can help correct this situation. These findings are replicated on the original problem considered by NEUROLOG, without the use of feature-delineation. This suggests that symbolic explanations constructed for data in a domain could be re-used in a related domain, by `feature-adaptation' of pre-trained neural extractors using the semantic loss function constrained by abductive feedback.

The downside of this technique is that the so-called domain gap between the real target images and synthetic training data leads to a decrease in performance. In this paper, we attempt to provide a holistic overview of how to use synthetic data for object detection. We analyse aspects of generating the data as well as techniques used to train the models. We do so by devising a number of experiments, training models on the Dataset of Industrial Metal Objects (DIMO). This dataset contains both real and synthetic images. The synthetic part has different subsets that are either exact synthetic copies of the real data or are copies with certain aspects randomised. This allows us to analyse what types of variation are good for synthetic training data and which aspects should be modelled to closely match the target data. Furthermore, we investigate what types of training techniques are beneficial towards generalisation to real data, and how to use them. Additionally, we analyse how real images can be leveraged when training on synthetic images. All these experiments are validated on real data and benchmarked to models trained on real data. The results offer a number of interesting takeaways that can serve as basic guidelines for using synthetic data for object detection.

As automated systems become more mainstream, it is important their decisions be transparent, reliable and understandable by humans for better trust and confidence. To this effect, concept-based models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) and Self-Explaining Neural Networks (SENN) have been proposed which constrain the latent space of a model to represent high level concepts easily understood by domain experts in the field. Although concept-based models promise a good approach to both increasing explainability and reliability, it is yet to be shown if they demonstrate robustness and output consistent concepts under systematic perturbations to their inputs. To better understand performance of concept-based models on curated malicious samples, in this paper, we aim to study their robustness to adversarial perturbations, which are also known as the imperceptible changes to the input data that are crafted by an attacker to fool a well-learned concept-based model. Specifically, we first propose and analyze different malicious attacks to evaluate the security vulnerability of concept based models. Subsequently, we propose a potential general adversarial training-based defense mechanism to increase robustness of these systems to the proposed malicious attacks. Extensive experiments on one synthetic and two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacks and the defense approach. ",

Therefore, DeFi protocols could hardly offer different users customized solutions, and the capital utilization is limited. To address this challenge in DeFi, we propose a solution, which is a trustful protocol that allows users to provide personal private data to DeFi protocols without worrying that such information would be disclosed. By implementing asymmetric encryption, zero-knowledge proof, and homomorphic encryption, we ensure that users' data will not be controlled by any centralized authorities and avoid potential financial losses or legal disputes due to information leakage. We further discuss the application scenarios of financial data privacy protection in public blockchain DeFi ecosystems and cross-border financial applications, such as credit aggregation. ",

To reduce additional costs, suction grippers with compliant bodies or mechanisms have been proposed; however, their bulkiness and limited allowable error hinder their use in complex environments with large errors. Here, we propose a compact suction gripper that can pick objects over a wide range of distances and tilt angles without elaborate sensing and control. The spring-inserted gripper body deploys and conforms to distant and tilted objects until the suction cup completely seals with the object and retracts immediately after, while holding the object. This seamless deployment and retraction is enabled by connecting the gripper body and suction cup to the same vacuum source, which couples the vacuum picking and retraction of the gripper body. Experimental results validated that the proposed gripper can pick objects within 79 mm, which is 1.4 times the initial length, and can pick objects with tilt angles up to 60{\\deg}. The feasibility of the gripper was verified by demonstrations, including picking objects of different heights from the same picking height and the bin picking of transparent objects. ",

In this paper, we specialize in one specific problem, Visual Defect Detection (VDD), in many industrial applications. And in practice, defect image samples are very rare and difficult to collect. Thus, we focus on the unsupervised visual defect detection and localization tasks and propose a novel framework based on the recent score-based generative models, which synthesize the real image by iterative denoising through stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Our work is inspired by the fact that with noise injected into the original image, the defects may be changed into normal cases in the denoising process (i.e., reconstruction). First, based on the assumption that the anomalous data lie in the low probability density region of the normal data distribution, we explain a common phenomenon that occurs when reconstruction-based approaches are applied to VDD: normal pixels also change during the reconstruction process. Second, due to the differences in normal pixels between the reconstructed and original images, a time-dependent gradient value (i.e., score) of normal data distribution is utilized as a metric, rather than reconstruction loss, to gauge the defects. Third, a novel $T$ scales approach is developed to dramatically reduce the required number of iterations, accelerating the inference process. These practices allow our model to generalize VDD in an unsupervised manner while maintaining reasonably good performance. We evaluate our method on several datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.

Due to the imperfect preservation of ancient documents over a long period of time, various types of degradation, including staining, yellowing, and ink seepage, have seriously affected the results of image binarization. In this paper, a three-stage method is proposed for image enhancement and binarization of degraded color document images by using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and generative adversarial network (GAN). In Stage-1, we use DWT and retain the LL subband images to achieve the image enhancement. In Stage-2, the original input image is split into four (Red, Green, Blue and Gray) single-channel images, each of which trains the independent adversarial networks. The trained adversarial network models are used to extract the color foreground information from the images. In Stage-3, in order to combine global and local features, the output image from Stage-2 and the original input image are used to train the independent adversarial networks for document binarization. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms many classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the Document Image Binarization Contest (DIBCO) dataset.

This paper proposes a novel architecture based on an encoder-decoder model with an attention mechanism that decouples the representation learning of the prefixes from the inference phase, predicting only the activities of the suffix. During the inference phase, this architecture is extended with a heuristic search algorithm that improves the selection of the activity for each index of the suffix.

The proposed algorithm inherits the advantages of conventional timing-based methods in that it computes accurate gradients with respect to spike timing, which promotes ideal temporal coding. Unlike conventional methods where each neuron fires at most once, the proposed algorithm allows each neuron to fire multiple times. This extension naturally improves the computational capacity of SNNs. Our SNN model outperformed comparable SNN models and achieved as high accuracy as non-convolutional artificial neural networks. The spike count property of our networks was altered depending on the time constant of the postsynaptic current and the membrane potential. Moreover, we found that there existed the optimal time constant with the maximum test accuracy. That was not seen in conventional SNNs with single-spike restrictions on time-to-fast-spike (TTFS) coding. This result demonstrates the computational properties of SNNs that biologically encode information into the multi-spike timing of individual neurons. Our code would be publicly available. ",

The main contribution of our work is to demonstrate that the associated decision problem, i.e., whether a set of attacks can exist which allows the final acceptability degrees to occur for given initial weights, is NP-complete for the weighted h-categoriser and cardinality-based semantics, and is polynomial for the weighted max-based semantics, even for the complete version of the problem (where all initial weights and final acceptability degrees are known).

    "abstract": "Sensor-based remote health monitoring is used in industrial, urban and healthcare settings to monitor ongoing operation of equipment and human health. An important aim is to intervene early if anomalous events or adverse health is detected. In the wild, these anomaly detection approaches are challenged by noise, label scarcity, high dimensionality, explainability and wide variability in operating environments. The Contextual Matrix Profile (CMP) is a configurable 2-dimensional version of the Matrix Profile (MP) that uses the distance matrix of all subsequences of a time series to discover patterns and anomalies. The CMP is shown to enhance the effectiveness of the MP and other SOTA methods at detecting, visualising and interpreting true anomalies in noisy real world data from different domains. It excels at zooming out and identifying temporal patterns at configurable time scales. However, the CMP does not address cross-sensor information, and cannot scale to high dimensional data. We propose a novel, self-supervised graph-based approach for temporal anomaly detection that works on context graphs generated from the CMP distance matrix. The learned graph embeddings encode the anomalous nature of a time context. In addition, we evaluate other graph outlier algorithms for the same task. Given our pipeline is modular, graph construction, generation of graph embeddings, and pattern recognition logic can all be chosen based on the specific pattern detection application. We verified the effectiveness of graph-based anomaly detection and compared it with the CMP and 3 state-of-the art methods on two real-world healthcare datasets with different anomalies. Our proposed method demonstrated better recall, alert rate and generalisability. ",

    "abstract": "Sensors in cyber-physical systems often capture interconnected processes and thus emit correlated time series (CTS), the forecasting of which enables important applications. The key to successful CTS forecasting is to uncover the temporal dynamics of time series and the spatial correlations among time series. Deep learning-based solutions exhibit impressive performance at discerning these aspects. In particular, automated CTS forecasting, where the design of an optimal deep learning architecture is automated, enables forecasting accuracy that surpasses what has been achieved by manual approaches. However, automated CTS solutions remain in their infancy and are only able to find optimal architectures for predefined hyperparameters and scale poorly to large-scale CTS. To overcome these limitations, we propose SEARCH, a joint, scalable framework, to automatically devise effective CTS forecasting models. Specifically, we encode each candidate architecture and accompanying hyperparameters into a joint graph representation. We introduce an efficient Architecture-Hyperparameter Comparator (AHC) to rank all architecture-hyperparameter pairs, and we then further evaluate the top-ranked pairs to select a final result. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEARCH not only eliminates manual efforts but also is capable of better performance than manually designed and existing automatically designed CTS models. In addition, it shows excellent scalability to large CTS. ",

Runtime monitors are components aiming to identify unsafe predictions and discard them before they can lead to catastrophic consequences. Several recent works on runtime monitoring have focused on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, i.e., identifying inputs that are different from the training data. In this work, we argue that OOD detection is not a well-suited framework to design efficient runtime monitors and that it is more relevant to evaluate monitors based on their ability to discard incorrect predictions. We call this setting out-ofmodel-scope detection and discuss the conceptual differences with OOD. We also conduct extensive experiments on popular datasets from the literature to show that studying monitors in the OOD setting can be misleading: 1. very good OOD results can give a false impression of safety, 2. comparison under the OOD setting does not allow identifying the best monitor to detect errors. Finally, we also show that removing erroneous training data samples helps to train better monitors. ",

    "abstract": "Helmholtz decompositions of the elastic fields open up new avenues for the solution of linear elastic scattering problems via boundary integral equations (BIE) [Dong, Lai, Li, Mathematics of Computation,2021]. The main appeal of this approach is that the ensuing systems of BIE feature only integral operators associated with the Helmholtz equation. However, these BIE involve non standard boundary integral operators that do not result after the application of either the Dirichlet or the Neumann trace to Helmholtz single and double layer potentials. Rather, the Helmholtz decomposition approach leads to BIE formulations of elastic scattering problems with Neumann boundary conditions that involve boundary traces of the Hessians of Helmholtz layer potential. As a consequence, the classical combined field approach applied in the framework of the Helmholtz decompositions leads to BIE formulations which, although robust, are not of the second kind. Following the regularizing methodology introduced in [Boubendir, Dominguez, Levadoux, Turc, SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics 2015] we design and analyze novel robust Helmholtz decomposition BIE for the solution of elastic scattering that are of the second kind in the case of smooth scatterers in two dimensions. We present a variety of numerical results based on Nystrom discretizations that illustrate the good performance of the second kind regularized formulations in connections to iterative solvers. ",

Based on exhaustive text cues in \"[CONTEXT]\", CLIP model is aware of different contexts, e.g. background, style, viewpoint, and exhibits unprecedented robustness against a wide range of distribution shifts. However, recent works find further fine-tuning of CLIP models improves accuracy but sacrifices the robustness on downstream tasks. We conduct an empirical investigation to show fine-tuning will corrupt the context-aware ability of pre-trained CLIP features. To solve this problem, we propose Context-Aware Robust Fine-tuning (CAR-FT). CAR-FT regularizes the model during fine-tuning to capture the context information. Specifically, we use zero-shot prompt weights to get the context distribution contained in the image. By minimizing the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between context distributions induced by original/fine-tuned CLIP models, CAR-FT makes the context-aware ability of CLIP inherited into downstream tasks, and achieves both higher In-Distribution (ID) and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) accuracy. The experimental results show CAR-FT achieves superior robustness on five OOD test datasets of ImageNet, and meanwhile brings accuracy gains on nine downstream tasks. Additionally, CAR-FT surpasses previous Domain Generalization (DG) methods and gets 78.5% averaged accuracy on DomainBed benchmark, building the new state-of-the-art. ",

Quantization is a technique for making neural networks more efficient by running them using low-bit integer arithmetic and is therefore commonly adopted in industry. Recent work has shown that floating-point neural networks that have been verified to be robust can become vulnerable to adversarial attacks after quantization, and certification of the quantized representation is necessary to guarantee robustness. In this work, we present quantization-aware interval bound propagation (QA-IBP), a novel method for training robust QNNs. Inspired by advances in robust learning of non-quantized networks, our training algorithm computes the gradient of an abstract representation of the actual network. Unlike existing approaches, our method can handle the discrete semantics of QNNs. Based on QA-IBP, we also develop a complete verification procedure for verifying the adversarial robustness of QNNs, which is guaranteed to terminate and produce a correct answer. Compared to existing approaches, the key advantage of our verification procedure is that it runs entirely on GPU or other accelerator devices. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods and establish the new state-of-the-art for training and certifying the robustness of QNNs. ",

Using automatic differentiation, we embed a PDE into a deep neural network's loss function to incorporate information from measurements and PDEs.

In 2D domain, inherent structures of different image formats are similar. Hence, backdoor attack designed for one image format will suite for others. However, when it comes to 3D world, there is a huge disparity among different 3D data structures. As a result, backdoor pattern designed for one certain 3D data structure will be disable for other data structures of the same 3D scene. Therefore, this paper designs a uniform backdoor pattern: NRBdoor (Noisy Rotation Backdoor) which is able to adapt for heterogeneous 3D data structures. Specifically, we start from the unit rotation and then search for the optimal pattern by noise generation and selection process. The proposed NRBdoor is natural and imperceptible, since rotation is a common operation which usually contains noise due to both the miss match between a pair of points and the sensor calibration error for real-world 3D scene. Extensive experiments on 3D mesh and point cloud show that the proposed NRBdoor achieves state-of-the-art performance, with negligible shape variation. ",

While RDF is conceptually simple, data models nevertheless get complex, when complex data needs to be represented. Additional levels of indirection with intermediate resources instead of simple properties lead to higher barriers for prospective users of the data. Based on three patterns, we argue that shifting information to a meta-level can not only be used to (1) provide provenance information, but can also help to (2) maintain backwards compatibility for existing models, and to (3) reduce the complexity of a data model. There are, however, multiple ways in RDF to use a meta-level, i.e., to provide additional statements about statements. With Named Graphs, there exists a well-established mechanism to describe groups of statements. Since its inception, however, it has been hard to make statements about single statements. With the introduction of RDF-star, a new way to provide data about single statements is now available. We show that the combination of RDF-star and Named Graphs is a viable solution to express data on a meta-level and propose that this meta-level should be used as first class citizen in data modeling.

We conduct experiments on the INTERACTION and Argoverse 2 datasets and demonstrate that FJMP produces more accurate and scene-consistent joint trajectory predictions than non-factorized approaches, especially on the most interactive and kinematically interesting agents.

Latent graph inference allows models to dynamically learn the intrinsic graph structure of problems where the connectivity patterns of data may not be directly accessible. In this work, we generalize the discrete Differentiable Graph Module (dDGM) for latent graph learning. The original dDGM architecture used the Euclidean plane to encode latent features based on which the latent graphs were generated. By incorporating Riemannian geometry into the model and generating more complex embedding spaces, we can improve the performance of the latent graph inference system. In particular, we propose a computationally tractable approach to produce product manifolds of constant curvature model spaces that can encode latent features of varying structure. The latent representations mapped onto the inferred product manifold are used to compute richer similarity measures that are leveraged by the latent graph learning model to obtain optimized latent graphs. Moreover, the curvature of the product manifold is learned during training alongside the rest of the network parameters and based on the downstream task, rather than it being a static embedding space. Our novel approach is tested on a wide range of datasets, and outperforms the original dDGM model. ",

To solve these problems, we propose Self-Locator Aided Network (SLAN) for cross-modal understanding tasks without any extra gold data. SLAN consists of a region filter and a region adaptor to localize regions of interest conditioned on different texts. By aggregating cross-modal information, the region filter selects key regions and the region adaptor updates their coordinates with text guidance. With detailed region-word alignments, SLAN can be easily generalized to many downstream tasks. It achieves fairly competitive results on five cross-modal understanding tasks (e.g., 85.7% and 69.2% on COCO image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval, surpassing previous SOTA methods). SLAN also demonstrates strong zero-shot and fine-tuned transferability to two localization tasks. ",

By analyzing the impact of request heterogeneity on some popular heuristic schedulers, it can be found that existing scheduling algorithms can not handle the request heterogeneity properly and efficiently. In this paper, a plug-and-play virtual machine scheduling intensifier, called Resource Assigner (ReAssigner), is proposed to enhance the scheduling efficiency of any given scheduler for heterogeneous requests. The key idea of ReAssigner is to pre-assign roles to physical resources and let resources of the same role form a virtual cluster to handle homogeneous requests. ReAssigner can cooperate with arbitrary schedulers by restricting their scheduling space to virtual clusters. With evaluations on the real dataset from Huawei Cloud, the proposed ReAssigner achieves significant scheduling performance improvement compared with some state-of-the-art scheduling methods. ",

We represent social network learning theory as an additional probability distribution that optimizes Markov chains in the graph vector space. The new parameters are then approximated via Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation. We show that our TTERGM model achieves improved fidelity and more accurate predictions compared to several benchmark methods on GitHub network data. ",

    "abstract": "Context: The IoT system infrastructure platform facility vulnerability attack has become the main battlefield of network security attacks. Most of the traditional vulnerability mining methods rely on vulnerability detection tools to realize vulnerability discovery. However, due to the inflexibility of tools and the limitation of file size, its scalability It is relatively low and cannot be applied to large-scale power big data fields. Objective: The goal of the research is to intelligently detect vulnerabilities in source codes of high-level languages such as C/C++. This enables us to propose a code representation of sensitive sentence-related slices of source code, and to detect vulnerabilities by designing a distributed deep ensemble learning model. Method: In this paper, a new directional vulnerability mining method of parallel ensemble learning is proposed to solve the problem of large-scale data vulnerability mining. By extracting sensitive functions and statements, a sensitive statement library of vulnerable codes is formed. The AST stream-based vulnerability code slice with higher granularity performs doc2vec sentence vectorization on the source code through the random sampling module, obtains different classification results through distributed training through the Bi-LSTM trainer, and obtains the final classification result by voting. Results: This method designs and implements a distributed deep ensemble learning system software vulnerability mining system called DCDetector. It can make accurate predictions by using the syntactic information of the code, and is an effective method for analyzing large-scale vulnerability data. Conclusion: Experiments show that this method can reduce the false positive rate of traditional static analysis and improve the performance and accuracy of machine learning. ",

    "abstract": "The instrumental variable (IV) approach is a widely used way to estimate the causal effects of a treatment on an outcome of interest from observational data with latent confounders. A standard IV is expected to be related to the treatment variable and independent of all other variables in the system. However, it is challenging to search for a standard IV from data directly due to the strict conditions. The conditional IV (CIV) method has been proposed to allow a variable to be an instrument conditioning on a set of variables, allowing a wider choice of possible IVs and enabling broader practical applications of the IV approach. Nevertheless, there is not a data-driven method to discover a CIV and its conditioning set directly from data. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose to learn the representations of the information of a CIV and its conditioning set from data with latent confounders for average causal effect estimation. By taking advantage of deep generative models, we develop a novel data-driven approach for simultaneously learning the representation of a CIV from measured variables and generating the representation of its conditioning set given measured variables. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method outperforms the existing IV methods. ",

    "abstract": "Deep 3D point cloud models are sensitive to adversarial attacks, which poses threats to safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Robust training and defend-by-denoise are typical strategies for defending adversarial perturbations, including adversarial training and statistical filtering, respectively. However, they either induce massive computational overhead or rely heavily upon specified noise priors, limiting generalized robustness against attacks of all kinds. This paper introduces a new defense mechanism based on denoising diffusion models that can adaptively remove diverse noises with a tailored intensity estimator. Specifically, we first estimate adversarial distortions by calculating the distance of the points to their neighborhood best-fit plane. Depending on the distortion degree, we choose specific diffusion time steps for the input point cloud and perform the forward diffusion to disrupt potential adversarial shifts. Then we conduct the reverse denoising process to restore the disrupted point cloud back to a clean distribution. This approach enables effective defense against adaptive attacks with varying noise budgets, achieving accentuated robustness of existing 3D deep recognition models. ",

MDProp utilizes multi-distribution data through an AX generation process while leveraging disentangled learning through multiple batch normalization layers during the training of a DML model. MDProp is the first to generate feature space multi-targeted AXs to perform targeted regularization on the training model's denser embedding space regions, resulting in improved embedding space densities contributing to the improved generalization in the trained models. From a comprehensive experimental analysis, we show that MDProp results in up to 2.95% increased clean data Recall@1 scores and up to 2.12 times increased robustness against different input distributions compared to the conventional methods.

    "abstract": "Deep metric learning aims to learn an embedding space, where semantically similar samples are close together and dissimilar ones are repelled against. To explore more hard and informative training signals for augmentation and generalization, recent methods focus on generating synthetic samples to boost metric learning losses. However, these methods just use the deterministic and class-independent generations (e.g., simple linear interpolation), which only can cover the limited part of distribution spaces around original samples. They have overlooked the wide characteristic changes of different classes and can not model abundant intra-class variations for generations. Therefore, generated samples not only lack rich semantics within the certain class, but also might be noisy signals to disturb training. In this paper, we propose a novel intra-class adaptive augmentation (IAA) framework for deep metric learning. We reasonably estimate intra-class variations for every class and generate adaptive synthetic samples to support hard samples mining and boost metric learning losses. Further, for most datasets that have a few samples within the class, we propose the neighbor correction to revise the inaccurate estimations, according to our correlation discovery where similar classes generally have similar variation distributions. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show our method significantly improves and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on retrieval performances by 3%-6%.

    "abstract": "In recent years, social media has been criticized for yielding polarization. Identifying emerging disagreements and growing polarization is important for journalists to create alerts and provide more balanced coverage. While recent studies have shown the existence of polarization on social media, they primarily focused on limited topics such as politics with a large volume of data collected in the long term, especially over months or years. While these findings are helpful, they are too late to create an alert immediately. To address this gap, we develop a domain-agnostic mining method to identify polarized topics on Twitter in a short-term period, namely 12 hours. As a result, we find that daily Japanese news-related topics in early 2022 were polarized by 31.6\\% within a 12-hour range. We also analyzed that they tend to construct information diffusion networks with a relatively high average degree, and half of the tweets are created by a relatively small number of people. However, it is very costly and impractical to collect a large volume of tweets daily on many topics and monitor the polarization due to the limitations of the Twitter API. To make it more cost-efficient, we also develop a prediction method using machine learning techniques to estimate the polarization level using randomly collected tweets leveraging the network information. Extensive experiments show a significant saving in collection costs compared to baseline methods. In particular, our approach achieves F-score of 0.85, requiring 4,000 tweets, 4x savings than the baseline. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to predict the polarization level of the topics with low-resource tweets. Our findings have profound implications for the news media, allowing journalists to detect and disseminate polarizing information quickly and efficiently. ",

Understanding what, if any, hidden parameters affect a particular environment can aid both the development and appropriate usage of RL systems. We present an unsupervised method to map RL trajectories into a feature space where distance represents the relative difference in system behavior due to hidden parameters. Our approach disentangles the effects of hidden parameters by leveraging a recurrent neural network (RNN) world model as used in model-based RL. First, we alter the standard world model training algorithm to isolate the hidden parameter information in the world model memory. Then, we use a metric learning approach to map the RNN memory into a space with a distance metric approximating a bisimulation metric with respect to the hidden parameters. The resulting disentangled feature space can be used to meaningfully relate trajectories to each other and analyze the hidden parameter. We demonstrate our approach on four hidden parameters across three RL environments. Finally we present two methods to help identify and understand the effects of hidden parameters on systems. ",

LiDAR-based localization methods, such as the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, can suffer in geometrically uninformative environments that are known to deteriorate registration performance and push optimization toward divergence along weakly constrained directions. To overcome this issue, this work proposes i) a robust multi-category (non-)localizability detection module, and ii) a localizability-aware constrained ICP optimization module and couples both in a unified manner. The proposed localizability detection is achieved by utilizing the correspondences between the scan and the map to analyze the alignment strength against the principal directions of the optimization as part of its multi-category LiDAR localizability analysis. In the second part, this localizability analysis is then tightly integrated into the scan-to-map point cloud registration to generate drift-free pose updates along well-constrained directions. The proposed method is thoroughly evaluated and compared to state-of-the-art methods in simulation and during real-world experiments1, underlying the gain in performance and reliability in LiDAR-challenging scenarios. In all experiments, the proposed framework demonstrates accurate and generalizable localizability detection and robust pose estimation without environment-specific parameter tuning. ",

    "abstract": "The pandemic required efficient allocation of public resources and transforming existing ways of societal functions. To manage any crisis, governments and public health researchers exploit the information available to them in order to make informed decisions, also defined as situational awareness. Gathering situational awareness using social media has been functional to manage epidemics. Previous research focused on using discussions during periods of epidemic crises on social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or Facebook and developing NLP techniques to filter out relevant discussions from a huge corpus of messages and posts. Social media usage varies with internet penetration and other socioeconomic factors, which might induce disparity in analyzing discussions across different geographies. However, print media is a ubiquitous information source, irrespective of geography. Further, topics discussed in news articles are already newsworthy, while on social media newsworthiness is a product of techno-social processes. Developing this fundamental difference, we study Twitter data during the second wave in India focused on six high-population cities with varied macroeconomic factors. Through a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods, we further analyze two Indian newspapers during the same period and compare topics from both Twitter and the newspapers to evaluate situational awareness around the second phase of COVID on each of these platforms. We conclude that factors like internet penetration and GDP in a specific city influence the discourse surrounding situational updates on social media. Thus, augmenting information from newspapers with information extracted from social media would provide a more comprehensive perspective in resource deficit cities. ",

The proposed dataset can be used for both supervised and unsupervised representation learning, and reduces the gap between pre-training with real and procedurally generated images by 38%. ",

We present two distributed algorithms which rely on quantized operation (i.e., nodes process and transmit quantized messages), and are able to calculate the exact solutions in a finite number of steps. Furthermore, during the operation of our algorithms, each node is able to determine in a distributed manner whether convergence has been achieved and thus terminate its operation. To the best of the authors' knowledge these algorithms are the first to find the exact solutions under quantized communication (i.e., there is no error in the final calculation). Additionally, note that our network size calculation algorithm is the first in the literature which calculates the exact size of a network in a finite number of steps without introducing a final error. This error in other algorithms can be either due to quantization or asymptotic convergence. In our case, no error is introduced since the desired result is calculated in the form of a fraction involving a quantized numerator and a quantized denominator. Finally, we demonstrate the operation of our algorithms and their potential advantages. ",

    "abstract": "Onboard visual sensing has been widely used in the unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) and/or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which can be modeled as dynamic systems on SE(3). The onboard sensing outputs of the dynamic system can usually be applied to derive the relative position between the feature marks and the system, but bearing with explicit geometrical constraint. Such a visual geometrical constraint makes the design of the visual observer on SE(3) very challenging, as it will cause a time-varying or switching visible set due to the varying number of feature marks in this set along different trajectories. Moreover, the possibility of having mis-identified feature marks and modeling uncertainties might result in a divergent estimation error. This paper proposes a new robust observer design method that can accommodate these uncertainties from onboard visual sensing. The key design idea for this observer is to estimate the visible set and identify the mis-identified features from the measurements. Based on the identified uncertainties, a switching strategy is proposed to ensure bounded estimation error for any given trajectory over a fixed time interval. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust observer. ",

We perform an extensive study across six datasets with eight models from three model families. Experimental results show that Coder-Reviewer reranking leads to consistent and significant improvement (up to 17% absolute accuracy gain) over reranking with the Coder model only. When combined with executability filtering, Coder-Reviewer reranking can often outperform the minimum Bayes risk method.

Despite recent efforts to theoretically analyze the expressive power of GNNs, a formal characterization of their ability to model interactions is lacking. The current paper aims to address this gap. Formalizing strength of interactions through an established measure known as separation rank, we quantify the ability of certain GNNs to model interaction between a given subset of vertices and its complement, i.e. between sides of a given partition of input vertices. Our results reveal that the ability to model interaction is primarily determined by the partition's walk index -- a graph-theoretical characteristic that we define by the number of walks originating from the boundary of the partition. Experiments with common GNN architectures corroborate this finding. As a practical application of our theory, we design an edge sparsification algorithm named Walk Index Sparsification (WIS), which preserves the ability of a GNN to model interactions when input edges are removed. WIS is simple, computationally efficient, and markedly outperforms alternative methods in terms of induced prediction accuracy. More broadly, it showcases the potential of improving GNNs by theoretically analyzing the interactions they can model. ",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on analyzing and improving the commonsense ability of recent popular vision-language (VL) models. Despite the great success, we observe that existing VL-models still lack commonsense knowledge/reasoning ability (e.g., \"Lemons are sour\"), which is a vital component towards artificial general intelligence. Through our analysis, we find one important reason is that existing large-scale VL datasets do not contain much commonsense knowledge, which motivates us to improve the commonsense of VL-models from the data perspective. Rather than collecting a new VL training dataset, we propose a more scalable strategy, i.e., \"Data Augmentation with kNowledge graph linearization for CommonsensE capability\" (DANCE). It can be viewed as one type of data augmentation technique, which can inject commonsense knowledge into existing VL datasets on the fly during training. More specifically, we leverage the commonsense knowledge graph (e.g., ConceptNet) and create variants of text description in VL datasets via bidirectional sub-graph sequentialization. For better commonsense evaluation, we further propose the first retrieval-based commonsense diagnostic benchmark. By conducting extensive experiments on some representative VL-models, we demonstrate that our DANCE technique is able to significantly improve the commonsense ability while maintaining the performance on vanilla retrieval tasks.

Deep learning techniques are potent classifiers for AD diagnosis, but most have been unable to identify biomarkers because of their lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose a pathway information-based neural network (PINNet) to predict AD patients and analyze blood and brain transcriptomic signatures using an interpretable deep learning model. PINNet is a deep neural network (DNN) model with pathway prior knowledge from either the Gene Ontology or Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes databases. Then, a backpropagation-based model interpretation method was applied to reveal essential pathways and genes for predicting AD. We compared the performance of PINNet with a DNN model without a pathway. Performances of PINNet outperformed or were similar to those of DNN without a pathway using blood and brain gene expressions, respectively. Moreover, PINNet considers more AD-related genes as essential features than DNN without a pathway in the learning process. Pathway analysis of protein-protein interaction modules of highly contributed genes showed that AD-related genes in blood were enriched with cell migration, PI3K-Akt, MAPK signaling, and apoptosis in blood. The pathways enriched in the brain module included cell migration, PI3K-Akt, MAPK signaling, apoptosis, protein ubiquitination, and t-cell activation. Collectively, with prior knowledge about pathways, PINNet reveals essential pathways related to AD. ",

However, computationally it is among the most difficult tasks to include in astrophysical simulations, because of the typically high (>40) number of reactions, the short evolutionary timescales (about $10^4$ times less than the ISM dynamical time) and the characteristic non-linearity and stiffness of the associated Ordinary Differential Equations system (ODEs). In this proof of concept work, we show that Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are a viable alternative to traditional ODE time integrators for stiff thermo-chemical systems, i.e. up to molecular hydrogen formation (9 species and 46 reactions). Testing different chemical networks in a wide range of densities ($-2< \\log n/{\\rm cm}^{-3}< 3$) and temperatures ($1 < \\log T/{\\rm K}< 5$), we find that a basic architecture can give a comfortable convergence only for simplified chemical systems: to properly capture the sudden chemical and thermal variations a Deep Galerkin Method is needed. Once trained ($\\sim 10^3$ GPUhr), the PINN well reproduces the strong non-linear nature of the solutions (errors $\\lesssim 10\\%$) and can give speed-ups up to a factor of $\\sim 200$ with respect to traditional ODE solvers. Further, the latter have completion times that vary by about $\\sim 30\\%$ for different initial $n$ and $T$, while the PINN method gives negligible variations. Both the speed-up and the potential improvement in load balancing imply that PINN-powered simulations are a very palatable way to solve complex chemical calculation in astrophysical and cosmological problems.

Of particular interest are conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), which allow you to divide images into several classes according to the value of some property of the image, and then specify the required class when generating new images. In the case of images from Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), an important property is the total brightness of all image pixels (image size), which is in direct correlation with the energy of primary particles. We used a cGAN technique to generate images similar to whose obtained in the TAIGA-IACT experiment. As a training set, we used a set of two-dimensional images generated using the TAIGA Monte Carlo simulation software. We artificiallly divided the training set into 10 classes, sorting images by size and defining the boundaries of the classes so that the same number of images fall into each class. These classes were used while training our network. The paper shows that for each class, the size distribution of the generated images is close to normal with the mean value located approximately in the middle of the corresponding class. We also show that for the generated images, the total image size distribution obtained by summing the distributions over all classes is close to the original distribution of the training set. The results obtained will be useful for more accurate generation of realistic synthetic images similar to the ones taken by IACTs. ",

In contrast, direct optimization turns the optimal control problem into an optimization problem directly without any requirement of pre-computing, but the dynamics-related objective can be hard to optimize when the problem is complicated. Our results highlight the priority of offline supervised learning in terms of both optimality and training time.

    "abstract": "Terahertz ultra-massive MIMO (THz UM-MIMO) is envisioned as one of the key enablers of 6G wireless networks, for which channel estimation is highly challenging. Traditional analytical estimation methods are no longer effective, as the enlarged array aperture and the small wavelength result in a mixture of far-field and near-field paths, constituting a hybrid-field channel. Deep learning (DL)-based methods, despite the competitive performance, generally lack theoretical guarantees and scale poorly with the size of the array. In this paper, we propose a general DL framework for THz UM-MIMO channel estimation, which leverages existing iterative channel estimators and is with provable guarantees. Each iteration is implemented by a fixed point network (FPN), consisting of a closed-form linear estimator and a DL-based non-linear estimator. The proposed method perfectly matches the THz UM-MIMO channel estimation due to several unique advantages. First, the complexity is low and adaptive. It enjoys provable linear convergence with a low per-iteration cost and monotonically increasing accuracy, which enables an adaptive accuracy-complexity tradeoff. Second, it is robust to practical distribution shifts and can directly generalize to a variety of heavily out-of-distribution scenarios with almost no performance loss, which is suitable for the complicated THz channel conditions. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulation results are provided to illustrate the advantages over the state-of-the-art methods in estimation accuracy, convergence rate, complexity, and robustness.

    "title": "Local canonical labeling of Erd\u0151s--R\u00e9nyi random graphs",
    "abstract": "We study local canonical labeling algorithms on an Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi random graph $G(n,p_n)$. A canonical labeling algorithm assigns a unique label to each vertex of an unlabeled graph such that the labels are invariant under isomorphism. Here we focus on local algorithms, where the label of each vertex depends only on its low-depth neighborhood. Czajka and Pandurangan showed that the degree profile of a vertex (i.e., the sorted list of the degrees of its neighbors) gives a canonical labeling with high probability when $n p_n = \\omega( \\log^{4}(n) / \\log \\log n )$ (and $p_{n} \\leq 1/2$); subsequently, Mossel and Ross showed that the same holds when $n p_n = \\omega( \\log^{2}(n) )$. Our first result shows that their analysis essentially cannot be improved: we prove that when $n p_n = o( \\log^{2}(n) / (\\log \\log n)^{3} )$, with high probability there exist distinct vertices with isomorphic $2$-neighborhoods. Our main result is a positive counterpart to this, showing that $3$-neighborhoods give a canonical labeling when $n p_n \\geq (1+\\delta) \\log n$ (and $p_n \\leq 1/2$); this improves a recent result of Ding, Ma, Wu, and Xu, completing the picture above the connectivity threshold. We also discuss implications for random graph isomorphism and shotgun assembly of random graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Causal disentanglement seeks a representation of data involving latent variables that relate to one another via a causal model. A representation is identifiable if both the latent model and the transformation from latent to observed variables are unique. In this paper, we study observed variables that are a linear transformation of a linear latent causal model. Data from interventions are necessary for identifiability: if one latent variable is missing an intervention, we show that there exist distinct models that cannot be distinguished. Conversely, we show that a single intervention on each latent variable is sufficient for identifiability. Our proof uses a generalization of the RQ decomposition of a matrix that replaces the usual orthogonal and upper triangular conditions with analogues depending on a partial order on the rows of the matrix, with partial order determined by a latent causal model. We corroborate our theoretical results with a method for causal disentanglement that accurately recovers a latent causal model. ",
