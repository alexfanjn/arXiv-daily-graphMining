    "abstract": "The robustness of neural network classifiers is becoming important in the safety-critical domain and can be quantified by robustness verification. However, at present, efficient and scalable verification techniques are always sound but incomplete. Therefore, the improvement of certified robustness bounds is the key criterion to evaluate the superiority of robustness verification approaches. In this paper, we present a Tight Linear approximation approach for robustness verification of Convolutional Neural Networks(Ti-Lin). For general CNNs, we first provide a new linear constraints for S-shaped activation functions, which is better than both existing Neuron-wise Tightest and Network-wise Tightest tools. We then propose Neuron-wise Tightest linear bounds for Maxpool function. We implement Ti-Lin, the resulting verification method. We evaluate it with 48 different CNNs trained on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Experimental results show that Ti-Lin significantly outperforms other five state-of-the-art methods(CNN-Cert, DeepPoly, DeepCert, VeriNet, Newise). Concretely, Ti-Lin certifies much more precise robustness bounds on pure CNNs with Sigmoid/Tanh/Arctan functions and CNNs with Maxpooling function with at most 63.70% and 253.54% improvement, respectively.

    "abstract": "Improving the scalability of GNNs is critical for large graphs. Existing methods leverage three sampling paradigms including node-wise, layer-wise and subgraph sampling, then design unbiased estimator for scalability. However, the high variance still severely hinders GNNs' performance. On account that previous studies either lacks variance analysis or only focus on a particular sampling paradigm, we firstly propose an unified node sampling variance analysis framework and analyze the core challenge \"circular dependency\" for deriving the minimum variance sampler, i. e., sampling probability depends on node embeddings while node embeddings can not be calculated until sampling is finished. Existing studies either ignore the node embeddings or introduce external parameters, resulting in the lack of a both efficient and effective variance reduction methods. Therefore, we propose the \\textbf{H}ierarchical \\textbf{E}stimation based \\textbf{S}ampling GNN (HE-SGNN) with first level estimating the node embeddings in sampling probability to break circular dependency, and second level employing sampling GNN operator to estimate the nodes' representations on the entire graph. Considering the technical difference, we propose different first level estimator, i.e., a time series simulation for layer-wise sampling and a feature based simulation for subgraph sampling. The experimental results on seven representative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. ",

    "abstract": "Subjective answer evaluation is a time-consuming and tedious task, and the quality of the evaluation is heavily influenced by a variety of subjective personal characteristics. Instead, machine evaluation can effectively assist educators in saving time while also ensuring that evaluations are fair and realistic. However, most existing methods using regular machine learning and natural language processing techniques are generally hampered by a lack of annotated answers and poor model interpretability, making them unsuitable for real-world use. To solve these challenges, we propose ProtSi Network, a unique semi-supervised architecture that for the first time uses few-shot learning to subjective answer evaluation. To evaluate students' answers by similarity prototypes, ProtSi Network simulates the natural process of evaluator scoring answers by combining Siamese Network which consists of BERT and encoder layers with Prototypical Network. We employed an unsupervised diverse paraphrasing model ProtAugment, in order to prevent overfitting for effective few-shot text classification. By integrating contrastive learning, the discriminative text issue can be mitigated. Experiments on the Kaggle Short Scoring Dataset demonstrate that the ProtSi Network outperforms the most recent baseline models in terms of accuracy and quadratic weighted kappa. ",

    "abstract": "Background: Stratifying cancer patients according to risk of relapse can personalize their care. In this work, we provide an answer to the following research question: How to utilize machine learning to estimate probability of relapse in early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer patients? Methods: For predicting relapse in 1,387 early-stage (I-II), non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients from the Spanish Lung Cancer Group data (65.7 average age, 24.8% females, 75.2% males) we train tabular and graph machine learning models. We generate automatic explanations for the predictions of such models. For models trained on tabular data, we adopt SHAP local explanations to gauge how each patient feature contributes to the predicted outcome. We explain graph machine learning predictions with an example-based method that highlights influential past patients. Results: Machine learning models trained on tabular data exhibit a 76% accuracy for the Random Forest model at predicting relapse evaluated with a 10-fold cross-validation (model was trained 10 times with different independent sets of patients in test, train and validation sets, the reported metrics are averaged over these 10 test sets). Graph machine learning reaches 68% accuracy over a 200-patient, held-out test set, calibrated on a held-out set of 100 patients. Conclusions: Our results show that machine learning models trained on tabular and graph data can enable objective, personalised and reproducible prediction of relapse and therefore, disease outcome in patients with early-stage NSCLC. With further prospective and multisite validation, and additional radiological and molecular data, this prognostic model could potentially serve as a predictive decision support tool for deciding the use of adjuvant treatments in early-stage lung cancer.

A contrastive loss is combined with a classification loss to train our deep learning model jointly. Data warping methods are used on input voice samples to improve the robustness of our method. Empirical results demonstrate that our method not only achieves high in-corpus and cross-corpus classification accuracy but also generates good embeddings sensitive to voice quality and robust across different corpora. We also compare our results against three baseline methods on clean and three variations of deteriorated in-corpus and cross-corpus datasets and demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms the baseline methods.

This paper is the first to investigate and identify this invisible gap as a bottleneck that has been overlooked in the existing SSL frameworks, potentially preventing the models from learning good representation. To solve this problem, we propose \"residual momentum\" to directly reduce this gap to encourage the student to learn the representation as close to that of the teacher as possible, narrow the performance gap with the teacher, and significantly improve the existing SSL. Our method is straightforward, easy to implement, and can be easily plugged into other SSL frameworks.

When trained on low-quality datasets, these models are prone to various error types, including hallucinations, i.e. outputs that are fluent, but unrelated to the source sentences. These errors are particularly dangerous, because on the surface the translation can be perceived as a correct output, especially if the reader does not understand the source language. We present a case study focusing on model understanding and regularisation to reduce hallucinations in NMT. We first use feature attribution methods to study the behaviour of an NMT model that produces hallucinations. We then leverage these methods to propose a novel loss function that substantially helps reduce hallucinations and does not require retraining the model from scratch. ",

Our method is specifically designed for efficient detection even with high dimensional data, and it empirically achieves up to 11x faster detection on realistic robotics settings compared to prior work while maintaining a low false negative rate in practice (whenever there is a distribution shift in our experiments, our method indeed emits an alert).

    "abstract": "Supervised neural networks are known to achieve excellent results in various image restoration tasks. However, such training requires datasets composed of pairs of corrupted images and their corresponding ground truth targets. Unfortunately, such data is not available in many applications. For the task of image denoising in which the noise statistics is unknown, several self-supervised training methods have been proposed for overcoming this difficulty. Some of these require knowledge of the noise model, while others assume that the contaminating noise is uncorrelated, both assumptions are too limiting for many practical needs. This work proposes a novel self-supervised training technique suitable for the removal of unknown correlated noise. The proposed approach neither requires knowledge of the noise model nor access to ground truth targets. The input to our algorithm consists of easily captured bursts of noisy shots. Our algorithm constructs artificial patch-craft images from these bursts by patch matching and stitching, and the obtained crafted images are used as targets for the training. Our method does not require registration of the images within the burst. We evaluate the proposed framework through extensive experiments with synthetic and real image noise. ",

To address these issues, we present FairMILE a general framework for fair and scalable graph representation learning. FairMILE is a multi-level framework that allows contemporary unsupervised graph embedding methods to scale to large graphs in an agnostic manner. FairMILE learns both fair and high-quality node embeddings where the fairness constraints are incorporated in each phase of the framework. Our experiments across two distinct tasks demonstrate that FairMILE can learn node representations that often achieve superior fairness scores and high downstream performance while significantly outperforming all the baselines in terms of efficiency.

Recently proposed verified local robustness techniques provide such a guarantee. This is the first paper that combines the ideas from verified local robustness and dynamic sparse training to develop `SparseVLR'-- a novel framework to search verified locally robust sparse networks. Obtained sparse models exhibit accuracy and robustness comparable to their dense counterparts at sparsity as high as 99%. Furthermore, unlike most conventional sparsification techniques, SparseVLR does not require a pre-trained dense model, reducing the training time by 50%.

Despite this increase in capability, most modern methods for the automatic interpretation of underwater videos focus only on the detection and counting organisms. We propose an efficient computer vision- and deep learning-based method for the detection of biological behaviours in videos. TempNet uses an encoder bridge and residual blocks to maintain model performance with a two-staged, spatial, then temporal, encoder. TempNet also presents temporal attention during spatial encoding as well as Wavelet Down-Sampling pre-processing to improve model accuracy. Although our system is designed for applications to diverse fish behaviours (i.e, is generic), we demonstrate its application to the detection of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) startle events. We compare the proposed approach with a state-of-the-art end-to-end video detection method (ReMotENet) and a hybrid method previously offered exclusively for the detection of sablefish's startle events in videos from an existing dataset. Results show that our novel method comfortably outperforms the comparison baselines in multiple metrics, reaching a per-clip accuracy and precision of 80% and 0.81, respectively. This represents a relative improvement of 31% in accuracy and 27% in precision over the compared methods using this dataset. Our computational pipeline is also highly efficient, as it can process each 4-second video clip in only 38ms. Furthermore, since it does not employ features specific to sablefish startle events, our system can be easily extended to other behaviours in future works. ",

High-speed simulation is crucial for conducting uncertainty quantification (UQ) when the simulation is repeated over many randomly sampled input points (aka, the Monte Carlo method). In some cases, UQ is only feasible with a surrogate model. Recently, Deep Neural Network (DNN) surrogate models have gained popularity for their hard-to-match emulation accuracy. However, it is well-known that DNN is prone to errors when input data are perturbed in particular ways, the very motivation for adversarial training. In the usage scenario of surrogate models, the concern is less of a deliberate attack but more of the high sensitivity of the DNN's accuracy to input directions, an issue largely ignored by researchers using emulation models. In this paper, we show the severity of this issue through empirical studies and hypothesis testing. Furthermore, we adopt methods in adversarial training to enhance the robustness of DNN surrogate models. Experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve the robustness of the surrogate models without compromising emulation accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "The problem of robustness in adverse weather conditions is considered a significant challenge for computer vision algorithms in the applicants of autonomous driving. Image rain removal algorithms are a general solution to this problem. They find a deep connection between raindrops/rain-streaks and images by mining the hidden features and restoring information about the rain-free environment based on the powerful representation capabilities of neural networks. However, previous research has focused on architecture innovations and has yet to consider the vulnerability issues that already exist in neural networks. This research gap hints at a potential security threat geared toward the intelligent perception of autonomous driving in the rain. In this paper, we propose a universal rain-removal attack (URA) on the vulnerability of image rain-removal algorithms by generating a non-additive spatial perturbation that significantly reduces the similarity and image quality of scene restoration. Notably, this perturbation is difficult to recognise by humans and is also the same for different target images. Thus, URA could be considered a critical tool for the vulnerability detection of image rain-removal algorithms. It also could be developed as a real-world artificial intelligence attack method. Experimental results show that URA can reduce the scene repair capability by 39.5% and the image generation quality by 26.4%, targeting the state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-image rain-removal algorithms currently available.

Advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) enable leveraging large unlabeled corpora for state-of-the-art few-shot and supervised learning performance. In this paper, we explore how ensemble methods can improve recent SSL techniques by developing a framework that permits data-dependent weighted cross-entropy losses. We refrain from ensembling the representation backbone; this choice yields an efficient ensemble method that incurs a small training cost and requires no architectural changes or computational overhead to downstream evaluation. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with two state-of-the-art SSL methods, DINO (Caron et al., 2021) and MSN (Assran et al., 2022). Our method outperforms both in multiple evaluation metrics on ImageNet-1K, particularly in the few-shot setting. We explore several weighting schemes and find that those which increase the diversity of ensemble heads lead to better downstream evaluation results. Thorough experiments yield improved prior art baselines which our method still surpasses; e.g., our overall improvement with MSN ViT-B/16 is 3.9 p.p. for 1-shot learning. ",

However, despite its extensive use, research on the universal properties of the convolutional neural network has been limited due to its complex nature. In this regard, we demonstrate the universal approximation theorem for convolutional neural networks. A convolution with padding outputs the data of the same shape as the input data; therefore, it is necessary to prove whether a convolutional neural network composed of convolutions can approximate such a function. We have shown that convolutional neural networks can approximate continuous functions whose input and output values have the same shape. In addition, the minimum depth of the neural network required for approximation was presented, and we proved that it is the optimal value. We also verified that convolutional neural networks with sufficiently deep layers have universality when the number of channels is limited. ",

Hence, ensuring the robustness of deep learning is not an option but a priority to enhance business and consumer confidence. Previous studies mostly focus on the data aspect of model variance. In this article, we systematically summarize DNN robustness issues and formulate them in a holistic view through two important aspects, i.e., data and software configuration variances in DNNs. We also provide a predictive framework to generate representative variances (counterexamples) by considering both data and configurations for robust learning through the lens of search-based optimization.

Adversarial examples can help reveal weaknesses, but they are often difficult for a human to interpret or draw generalizable, actionable conclusions from. Some previous works have addressed this by studying human-interpretable attacks. We build on these with three contributions. First, we introduce a method termed Search for Natural Adversarial Features Using Embeddings (SNAFUE) which offers a fully-automated method for finding \"copy/paste\" attacks in which one natural image can be pasted into another in order to induce an unrelated misclassification. Second, we use this to red team an ImageNet classifier and identify hundreds of easily-describable sets of vulnerabilities. Third, we compare this approach with other interpretability tools by attempting to rediscover trojans.

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph (KG) errors introduce non-negligible noise, severely affecting KG-related downstream tasks. Detecting errors in KGs is challenging since the patterns of errors are unknown and diverse, while ground-truth labels are rare or even unavailable. A traditional solution is to construct logical rules to verify triples, but it is not generalizable since different KGs have distinct rules with domain knowledge involved. Recent studies focus on designing tailored detectors or ranking triples based on KG embedding loss. However, they all rely on negative samples for training, which are generated by randomly replacing the head or tail entity of existing triples. Such a negative sampling strategy is not enough for prototyping practical KG errors, e.g., (Bruce_Lee, place_of_birth, China), in which the three elements are often relevant, although mismatched. We desire a more effective unsupervised learning mechanism tailored for KG error detection. To this end, we propose a novel framework - ContrAstive knowledge Graph Error Detection (CAGED). It introduces contrastive learning into KG learning and provides a novel way of modeling KG. Instead of following the traditional setting, i.e., considering entities as nodes and relations as semantic edges, CAGED augments a KG into different hyper-views, by regarding each relational triple as a node. After joint training with KG embedding and contrastive learning loss, CAGED assesses the trustworthiness of each triple based on two learning signals, i.e., the consistency of triple representations across multi-views and the self-consistency within the triple. Extensive experiments on three real-world KGs show that CAGED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in KG error detection. Our codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/Qing145/CAGED.git.

Without any security and privacy considerations, each user can communicate its item to the server by using $\\log d$ bits. A naive application of secure aggregation protocols would, however, require $d\\log n$ bits per user. Can we reduce the communication needed for secure aggregation, and does security come with a fundamental cost in communication? In this paper, we develop an information-theoretic model for secure aggregation that allows us to characterize the fundamental cost of security and privacy in terms of communication. We show that with security (and without privacy) $\\Omega\\left( n \\log d \\right)$ bits per user are necessary and sufficient to allow the server to compute the frequency distribution. This is significantly smaller than the $d\\log n$ bits per user needed by the naive scheme, but significantly higher than the $\\log d$ bits per user needed without security. To achieve differential privacy, we construct a linear scheme based on a noisy sketch which locally perturbs the data and does not require a trusted server (a.k.a. distributed differential privacy). We analyze this scheme under $\\ell_2$ and $\\ell_\\infty$ loss. By using our information-theoretic framework, we show that the scheme achieves the optimal accuracy-privacy trade-off with optimal communication cost, while matching the performance in the centralized case where data is stored in the central server.

To tackle this issue, we propose a methodology to perform malware detection and family attribution. The proposed methodology first performs the extraction of opcodes from malwares in each family and constructs their respective opcode graphs. We explore the use of clustering algorithms on the opcode graphs to detect clusters of malwares within the same malware family. Such clusters can be seen as belonging to different sub-family groups. Opcode graph signatures are built from each detected cluster. Hence, for each malware family, a group of signatures is generated to represent the family. These signatures are used to classify an unknown sample as benign or belonging to one the malware families. We evaluate our methodology by performing experiments on a dataset consisting of both benign files and malware samples belonging to a number of different malware families and comparing the results to existing approach.

Anomaly detection is realized according to the difference between the output frame and the true value. In order to strengthen the characteristic information connection between continuous video frames, the residual temporal shift module and the residual channel attention module are introduced to improve the modeling ability of the network on temporal information and channel information, respectively. Due to the excessive generalization of convolutional neural networks, in the memory enhancement modules, the hopping connections of each codec layer are added to limit autoencoders' ability to represent abnormal frames too vigorously and improve the anomaly detection accuracy of the network. In addition, the objective function is modified by a feature discretization loss, which effectively distinguishes different normal behavior patterns. The experimental results on the CUHK Avenue and ShanghaiTech datasets show that the proposed method is superior to the current mainstream video anomaly detection methods while meeting the real-time requirements.

Unsupervised methods based on reconstruction and embedding have been widely studied for anomaly detection, of which reconstruction-based methods are the most popular. However, establishing a unified model for textured surface defect detection remains a challenge because these surfaces can vary in homogeneous and non regularly ways. Furthermore, existing reconstruction-based methods do not have a strong ability to convert the defect feature to the normal feature. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised reference-based autoencoder (RB-AE) to accurately inspect a variety of textured defects. Unlike most reconstruction-based methods, artificial defects and a novel pixel-level discrimination loss function are utilized for training to enable the model to obtain pixel-level discrimination ability. First, the RB-AE employs an encoding module to extract multi-scale features of the textured surface. Subsequently, a novel reference-based attention module (RBAM) is proposed to convert the defect features to normal features to suppress the reconstruction of defects. In addition, RBAM can also effectively suppress the defective feature residual caused by skip-connection. Next, a decoding module utilizes the repaired features to reconstruct the normal texture background. Finally, a novel multiscale feature discrimination module (MSFDM) is employed to defect detection and segmentation. ",

However, most of them consider the learning algorithms for directed acyclic graph (DAG) of Bayesian network (BN). These BN-based models only have limited causal explainability because of the issue of Markov equivalence class. Moreover, they are dependent on the assumption of stationarity, whereas many sampling time series from complex system are nonstationary. The nonstationary time series bring dataset shift problem, which leads to the unsatisfactory performances of these algorithms. To fill these gaps, a novel causation model named Unique Causal Network (UCN) is proposed in this paper. Different from the previous BN-based models, UCN considers the influence of time delay, and proves the uniqueness of obtained network structure, which addresses the issue of Markov equivalence class. Furthermore, based on the decomposability property of UCN, a higher-order causal entropy (HCE) algorithm is designed to identify the structure of UCN in a distributed way. HCE algorithm measures the strength of causality by using nearest-neighbors entropy estimator, which works well on nonstationary time series. Finally, lots of experiments validate that HCE algorithm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy when time series are nonstationary, compared to the other baseline algorithms. ",

Because the cost function of the adaptive steganography does not consider the impact of modification on the robustness, the modified DCT coefficients of the stego image after TCM will change after recompression. To reduce the number of changed coefficients after recompression, this paper proposes a robust steganography algorithm which dynamically updates the robustness cost of every DCT coefficient. The robustness cost proposed is calculated by testing whether the modified DCT coefficient can resist recompression in every step of STC embedding process. By adding robustness cost to the distortion cost and using the framework of STC embedding algorithm to embed the message, the stego images have good performance both in robustness and security. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly enhance the robustness of stego images, and the embedded messages could be extracted correctly at almost all cases when recompressing with a lower quality factor and recompression process is known to the user of proposed algorithm.

In this paper, we address small target motion detection problem by developing a visual system with spatio-temporal feedback loop, and further reveal its important roles in suppressing false positive background movement while enhancing network responses to small targets. Specifically, the proposed visual system is composed of two complementary subnetworks. The first subnetwork is designed to extract spatial and temporal motion patterns of cluttered backgrounds by neuronal ensemble coding. The second subnetwork is developed to capture small target motion information and integrate the spatio-temporal feedback signal from the first subnetwork to inhibit background false positives. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed spatio-temporal feedback visual system is more competitive than existing methods in discriminating small moving targets from complex dynamic environment.

It is important to separate and analyse the case of climate-based disruptions and how they affect systems' resilience. This paper presents a probabilistic resilience assessment framework where failure scenarios and network disruptions are generated using weather profile data from climate prediction models with component-level fragility functions. A case study is then carried out to quantify the resilience of Great Britain's railway passenger transport system to high-temperature-related track buckling under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) climate change scenario. A 95-year horizon on the resilience of the railway system is drawn. The results also reveal the non-linear responses of the railway system to the increasing temperature and show that models considering random asset failures overestimate the system's resilience. ",

    "abstract": "Data dissemination is a fundamental task in distributed computing. This paper studies broadcast problems in various innovative models where the communication network connecting $n$ processes is dynamic (e.g., due to mobility or failures) and controlled by an adversary. In the first model, the processes transitively communicate their ids in synchronous rounds along a rooted tree given in each round by the adversary whose goal is to maximize the number of rounds until at least one id is known by all processes. Previous research has shown a $\\lceil{\\frac{3n-1}{2}}\\rceil-2$ lower bound and an $O(n\\log\\log n)$ upper bound. We show the first linear upper bound for this problem, namely $\\lceil{(1 + \\sqrt 2) n-1}\\rceil \\approx 2.4n$. We extend these results to the setting where the adversary gives in each round $k$-disjoint forests and their goal is to maximize the number of rounds until there is a set of $k$ ids such that each process knows of at least one of them. We give a $\\left\\lceil{\\frac{3(n-k)}{2}}\\right\\rceil-1$ lower bound and a $\\frac{\\pi^2+6}{6}n+1 \\approx 2.6n$ upper bound for this problem. Finally, we study the setting where the adversary gives in each round a directed graph with $k$ roots and their goal is to maximize the number of rounds until there exist $k$ ids that are known by all processes.

    "abstract": "As we move towards an energy system based on renewable energy sources, we need to consider their inflexibility to meet sudden peaks in demand. It is therefore important to reduce the peak load placed on our energy system. For individual households this means spreading out the use of high-powered appliances, such as dishwashers and washing machines, throughout the day. Traditional approaches to this problem have relied on differential pricing set by a centralised utility company, but this mechanism has not been effective in promoting widespread shifting of appliance usage. Our previous research investigated a decentralised mechanism where agents receive an initial allocation of time-slots to use their appliances, which they can then exchange with other agents. This was found to be an effective approach to reducing the peak load within a community energy system when we introduced social capital, the tracking of favours given and received, in order to incentivise agents to act flexibly by accepting exchanges that do not immediately benefit them. This system encouraged self-interested agents to learn socially beneficial behaviour in order to earn social capital that they could later use to improve their own performance. In this paper we expand this work by implementing real world household appliance usage data in order to ensure that our mechanism could adapt to the challenging demand needs of real households. We also demonstrate how smaller and more diverse populations can optimise more effectively than larger community energy systems and better overcome the challenges of real-world demand peaks. ",

    "abstract": "Deploying services efficiently while satisfying their quality requirements is a major challenge in network slicing. Effective solutions place instances of the services' virtual network functions (VNFs) at different locations of the cellular infrastructure and manage such instances by scaling them as needed. In this work, we address the above problem and the very relevant aspect of sub-slice reuse among different services. Further, unlike prior art, we account for the services' finite lifetime and time-varying traffic load. We identify two major sources of inefficiency in service management: (i) the overspending of computing resources due to traffic of multiple services with different latency requirements being processed by the same virtual machine (VM), and (ii) the poor packing of traffic processing requests in the same VM, leading to opening more VMs than necessary. To cope with the above issues, we devise an algorithm, called REShare, that can dynamically adapt to the system's operational conditions and find an optimal trade-off between the aforementioned opposite requirements. We prove that REShare has low algorithmic complexity and is asymptotic 2-competitive under a non-decreasing load. Numerical results, leveraging real-world scenarios, show that our solution outperforms alternatives, swiftly adapting to time-varying conditions and reducing service cost by over 25%. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models have been deployed for high-stakes applications, e.g., healthcare and criminal justice. Prior work has shown that ML models are vulnerable to attribute inference attacks where an adversary, with some background knowledge, trains an ML attack model to infer sensitive attributes by exploiting distinguishable model predictions. However, some prior attribute inference attacks have strong assumptions about adversary's background knowledge (e.g., marginal distribution of sensitive attribute) and pose no more privacy risk than statistical inference. Moreover, none of the prior attacks account for class imbalance of sensitive attribute in datasets coming from real-world applications (e.g., Race and Sex). In this paper, we propose an practical and effective attribute inference attack that accounts for this imbalance using an adaptive threshold over the attack model's predictions. We exhaustively evaluate our proposed attack on multiple datasets and show that the adaptive threshold over the model's predictions drastically improves the attack accuracy over prior work. Finally, current literature lacks an effective defence against attribute inference attacks. We investigate the impact of fairness constraints (i.e., designed to mitigate unfairness in model predictions) during model training on our attribute inference attack. We show that constraint based fairness algorithms which enforces equalized odds acts as an effective defense against attribute inference attacks without impacting the model utility. Hence, the objective of algorithmic fairness and sensitive attribute privacy are aligned. ",

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction is a fundamental problem and challenge for autonomous vehicles. Early works mainly focused on designing complicated architectures for deep-learning-based prediction models in normal-illumination environments, which fail in dealing with low-light conditions. This paper proposes a novel approach for trajectory prediction in low-illumination scenarios by leveraging multi-stream information fusion, which flexibly integrates image, optical flow, and object trajectory information. The image channel employs Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) networks to extract temporal information from the camera. The optical flow channel is applied to capture the pattern of relative motion between adjacent camera frames and modelled by Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN). The trajectory channel is used to recognize high-level interactions between vehicles. Finally, information from all the three channels is effectively fused in the prediction module to generate future trajectories of surrounding vehicles in low-illumination conditions. The proposed multi-channel graph convolutional approach is validated on HEV-I and newly generated Dark-HEV-I, egocentric vision datasets that primarily focus on urban intersection scenarios. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines, in standard and low-illumination scenarios. Additionally, our approach is generic and applicable to scenarios with different types of perception data.

GNS discretizes the domain with nodes representing a collection of material points and the links connecting the nodes representing the local interaction between particles or clusters of particles. The GNS learns the interaction laws through message passing on the graph. GNS has three components: (a) Encoder, which embeds particle information to a latent graph, the edges are learned functions; (b) Processor, which allows data propagation and computes the nodal interactions across steps; and (c) Decoder, which extracts the relevant dynamics (e.g., particle acceleration) from the graph. We introduce physics-inspired simple inductive biases, such as an inertial frame that allows learning algorithms to prioritize one solution (constant gravitational acceleration) over another, reducing learning time. The GNS implementation uses semi-implicit Euler integration to update the next state based on the predicted accelerations. GNS trained on trajectory data is generalizable to predict particle kinematics in complex boundary conditions not seen during training. The trained model accurately predicts within a 5\\% error of its associated material point method (MPM) simulation. The predictions are 5,000x faster than traditional MPM simulations (2.5 hours for MPM simulations versus 20 s for GNS simulation of granular flow). GNS surrogates are popular for solving optimization, control, critical-region prediction for in situ viz, and inverse-type problems.

Through this formulation, speaker dependency and overlaps can be explicitly modeled. To fully leverage this formulation, we further propose the speaker overlap-aware neural diarization (SOND) model, which consists of a context-independent (CI) scorer to model global speaker discriminability, a context-dependent scorer (CD) to model local discriminability, and a speaker combining network (SCN) to combine and reassign speaker activities. Experimental results show that using the proposed formulation can outperform the state-of-the-art methods based on target speaker voice activity detection, and the performance can be further improved with SOND, resulting in a 6.30% relative diarization error reduction.

Standard Bayesian optimization algorithms fail to effectively leverage the underlying causal structure. Existing CBO approaches assume noiseless measurements and do not come with guarantees. We propose model-based causal Bayesian optimization (MCBO), an algorithm that learns a full system model instead of only modeling intervention-reward pairs. MCBO propagates epistemic uncertainty about the causal mechanisms through the graph and trades off exploration and exploitation via the optimism principle. We bound its cumulative regret, and obtain the first non-asymptotic bounds for CBO. Unlike in standard Bayesian optimization, our acquisition function cannot be evaluated in closed form, so we show how the reparameterization trick can be used to apply gradient-based optimizers.

However, convolutions are not equivariant to variations in scale and fail to generalize to objects of different sizes. Despite recent advances in this field, it remains unclear how well current methods generalize to unobserved scales on real-world data and to what extent scale equivariance plays a role. To address this, we propose the novel Scaled and Translated Image Recognition (STIR) benchmark based on four different domains. Additionally, we introduce a new family of models that applies many re-scaled kernels with shared weights in parallel and then selects the most appropriate one. Our experimental results on STIR show that both the existing and proposed approaches can improve generalization across scales compared to standard convolutions. We also demonstrate that our family of models is able to generalize well towards larger scales and improve scale equivariance. Moreover, due to their unique design we can validate that kernel selection is consistent with input scale. Even so, none of the evaluated models maintain their performance for large differences in scale, demonstrating that a general understanding of how scale equivariance can improve generalization and robustness is still lacking.

Comparison with other competitive conditional language models (CLMs) reveals the superiority of GENIUS's text generation quality. We further show that GENIUS can be used as a strong and ready-to-use data augmentation tool for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the needs of resiliency, scalability, and plug-and-play operation, distributed decision-making is becoming increasingly prevalent. The problem of achieving consensus in a multi-agent system is at the core of distributed decision-making. In this article, we study the problem of achieving average consensus over a directed multi-agent network when the communication links are corrupted with noise. We propose an algorithm where each agent updates its estimates based on the local mixing of information and adds its weighted noise-free initial information to its updates during every iteration. We demonstrate that with appropriately designed weights the agents achieve consensus under additive communication noise. We establish that when the communication links are noiseless the proposed algorithm moves towards consensus at a geometric rate. Under communication noise, we prove that the agent estimates reach a consensus value almost surely. We present numerical experiments to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm under different noise realizations and various algorithm parameters. ",

    "abstract": "Social media has become an important data source for event analysis. When collecting this type of data, most contain no useful information to a target event. Thus, it is essential to filter out those noisy data at the earliest opportunity for a human expert to perform further inspection. Most existing solutions for event filtering rely on fully supervised methods for training. However, in many real-world scenarios, having access to large number of labeled samples is not possible. To deal with a few labeled sample training problem for event filtering, we propose a graph-based few-shot learning pipeline. We also release the Brazilian Protest Dataset to test our method. To the best of our knowledge, this dataset is the first of its kind in event filtering that focuses on protests in multi-modal social media data, with most of the text in Portuguese. Our experimental results show that our proposed pipeline has comparable performance with only a few labeled samples (60) compared with a fully labeled dataset (3100).

These models are usually white-box, as they are obtained based on full knowledge of the district heating network and its parameters. This type of model is time-consuming to obtain, and might differ from the actual behavior of the system. In this paper, a method is proposed to obtain a grey-box hydraulic model for tree-shaped district heating systems: hydraulic parameters are estimated based on pressure measurements in only two locations. While previous works only estimate parameters related to pressure losses in pipes, this work also includes customers valves in the grey-box model structure, an important inclusion for control-oriented applications. Finally, a numerical example illustrates the proposed method on a small district heating network, showing its ability to obtain an accurate model on the basis of noisy measurements. ",

More recently, some have used deep learning to improve or refine existing pipelines, while others have proposed end-to-end approaches, including autoencoders and implicit neural representations, such as SIREN and NeRV. In this work, we propose Neural Visual Representation with Content-adaptive Embedding (CNeRV), which combines the generalizability of autoencoders with the simplicity and compactness of implicit representation. We introduce a novel content-adaptive embedding that is unified, concise, and internally (within-video) generalizable, that compliments a powerful decoder with a single-layer encoder. We match the performance of NeRV, a state-of-the-art implicit neural representation, on the reconstruction task for frames seen during training while far surpassing for frames that are skipped during training (unseen images). To achieve similar reconstruction quality on unseen images, NeRV needs 120x more time to overfit per-frame due to its lack of internal generalization. With the same latent code length and similar model size, CNeRV outperforms autoencoders on reconstruction of both seen and unseen images. We also show promising results for visual data compression.

The network was trained to predict the ground-truth parameter values from simulated noisy data and applied to imaging data acquired in a clinical setting to generate microstructural parameter maps. Our model could estimate model parameters from spherical data more accurately than conventional non-linear least squares or a multi-layer perceptron applied on powder-averaged data (i.e., the spherical mean technique, a popular method for orientationally invariant microstructural parameter estimation).

Two vertex disjoint geometric graphs with vertices in $S$ cross if there are two edges, one from each graph, which cross. A set of vertex disjoint geometric graphs with vertices in $S$ is called mutually crossing if any two of them cross. We show that there exists a constant $c$ such that from any family of $n$ mutually crossing triangles, one can always obtain a family of at least $n^c$ mutually crossing $2$-paths (each of which is the result of deleting an edge from one of the triangles) and then provide an example that implies that $c$ cannot be taken to be larger than $2/3$. For every $n$ we determine the maximum number of crossings that a Hamiltonian cycle on a set of $n$ points might have. Next, we construct a point set whose longest perfect matching contains no crossings. We also consider edges consisting of a horizontal and a vertical line segment joining pairs of points of $S$, which we call elbows, and prove that in any point set $S$ there exists a family of $\\lfloor n/4 \\rfloor$ vertex disjoint mutually crossing elbows. Additionally, we show a point set that admits no more than $n/3$ mutually crossing elbows. Finally we study intersecting families of graphs, which are not necessarily vertex disjoint. A set of edge disjoint graphs with vertices in $S$ is called an intersecting family if for any two graphs in the set we can choose an edge in each of them such that they cross.

Graph neural networks have been used to address this task by treating jets as point clouds with underlying, learnable, edge connections between the particles inside. We explore the decision-making process for one such state-of-the-art network, ParticleNet, by looking for relevant edge connections identified using the layerwise-relevance propagation technique. As the model is trained, we observe changes in the distribution of relevant edges connecting different intermediate clusters of particles, known as subjets. The resulting distribution of subjet connections is different for signal jets originating from top quarks, whose subjets typically correspond to its three decay products, and background jets originating from lighter quarks and gluons. This behavior indicates that the model is using traditional jet substructure observables, such as the number of prongs -- energetic particle clusters -- within a jet, when identifying jets. ",

Here we demonstrate that the measure presents severe shortcomings when applied to networks with unequal group sizes and asymmetric mixing.

We propose the adjusted nominal assortativity and show that this adjustment recovers the expected assortativity in networks with various level of mixing. Furthermore, we propose an analytical method to assess asymmetric mixing by estimating the tendency of inter- and intra-group connectivities.

A baseline approach to these tasks is to interpolate a time series with a Damped Random Walk (DRW) model, in which the spectrum is inferred using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). However, the DRW model does not describe the smoothness of the time series, and MLE faces many problems in terms of optimization and numerical precision. In this work, we introduce a new stochastic model that we call $\\textit{Convolved Damped Random Walk}$ (CDRW). This model introduces a concept of smoothness to a DRW, which enables it to describe quasar spectra completely. We also introduce a new method of inference of Gaussian process parameters, which we call $\\textit{Neural Inference}$. This method uses the powers of state-of-the-art neural networks to improve the conventional MLE inference technique. In our experiments, the Neural Inference method results in significant improvement over the baseline MLE (RMSE: $0.318 \\rightarrow 0.205$, $0.464 \\rightarrow 0.444$). Moreover, the combination of both the CDRW model and Neural Inference significantly outperforms the baseline DRW and MLE in interpolating a typical quasar light curve ($\\chi^2$: $0.333 \\rightarrow 0.998$, $2.695 \\rightarrow 0.981$).

Device-free human detection through sensors or cameras has been widely adopted but with privacy issues as well as misdetection for motionless people. To resolve these defects, channel state information (CSI) captured from commercialized Wi-Fi devices is capable of providing plentiful signal features for accurate detection. The existing systems has inaccurate classification under a non-line-of-sight (NLoS) and stationery scenario of a person standing still at corner in a room. In this work, we have proposed a colorization and contrastive learning enhanced NLoS human presence detection (CRONOS) system.

Furthermore, supervised contrastive learning is conceived to retrieve substantial representations, where consultation loss is formulated to differentiate the representative distances between dynamic and stationery cases. Furthermore, a self-switched static feature enhanced classifier (S3FEC) is proposed to determine the utilization of either RPs or coloring CSI ratio. Finally, comprehensive experimental results have revealed that our proposed CRONOS outperforms the existing systems applying machine learning, non-learning based methods as well as non-CSI based features in open literature, which achieves the highest presence detection accuracy and moderate computational complexity in vacancy, mobility, LoS and NLoS scenarios.

Therefore, it is crucial that sensors are placed as efficiently as possible, maximising the informativeness of their measurements. Previous approaches for identifying salient placement locations typically model the data with a Gaussian process (GP). However, designing a GP covariance which captures the complex behaviour of non-stationary spatiotemporal data is a difficult task. Further, the computational cost of these models make them challenging to scale to large environmental datasets. In this work, we explore using convolutional Gaussian neural processes (ConvGNPs) to address these issues. A ConvGNP is a meta-learning model which uses a neural network to parameterise a GP predictive. Our model is data-driven, flexible, efficient, and permits gridded or off-grid input data. Using simulated surface temperature fields over Antarctica as ground truth, we show that a ConvGNP substantially outperforms a non-stationary GP baseline in terms of predictive performance. We then use the ConvGNP in a temperature sensor placement toy experiment, yielding promising results. ",

In this study, we test the ability for the AIF to capture the role of anticipation in the visual guidance of action in humans through the systematic investigation of a visual-motor task that has been well-explored -- that of intercepting a target moving over a ground plane. Previous research demonstrated that humans performing this task resorted to anticipatory changes in speed intended to compensate for semi-predictable changes in target speed later in the approach. To capture this behavior, our proposed \"neural\" AIF agent uses artificial neural networks to select actions on the basis of a very short term prediction of the information about the task environment that these actions would reveal along with a long-term estimate of the resulting cumulative expected free energy. Systematic variation revealed that anticipatory behavior emerged only when required by limitations on the agent's movement capabilities, and only when the agent was able to estimate accumulated free energy over sufficiently long durations into the future. In addition, we present a novel formulation of the prior function that maps a multi-dimensional world-state to a uni-dimensional distribution of free-energy. Together, these results demonstrate the use of AIF as a plausible model of anticipatory visually guided behavior in humans. ",
