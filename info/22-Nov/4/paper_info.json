    "abstract": "Recognizing and telling similar objects apart is even hard for human beings. In this paper, we show that there is a phenomenon of class interference with all deep neural networks. Class interference represents the learning difficulty in data, and it constitutes the largest percentage of generalization errors by deep networks. To understand class interference, we propose cross-class tests, class ego directions and interference models. We show how to use these definitions to study minima flatness and class interference of a trained model. We also show how to detect class interference during training through label dancing pattern and class dancing notes. ",

    "abstract": "Radiology report generation (RRG) has gained increasing research attention because of its huge potential to mitigate medical resource shortages and aid the process of disease decision making by radiologists. Recent advancements in Radiology Report Generation (RRG) are largely driven by improving models' capabilities in encoding single-modal feature representations, while few studies explore explicitly the cross-modal alignment between image regions and words. Radiologists typically focus first on abnormal image regions before they compose the corresponding text descriptions, thus cross-modal alignment is of great importance to learn an abnormality-aware RRG model. Motivated by this, we propose a Class Activation Map guided Attention Network (CAMANet) which explicitly promotes cross-modal alignment by employing the aggregated class activation maps to supervise the cross-modal attention learning, and simultaneously enriches the discriminative information. Experimental results demonstrate that CAMANet outperforms previous SOTA methods on two commonly used RRG benchmarks. ",

We delve into the use of Bitmoji stickers, a highly expressive form of pictorial communication using avatars resembling actual users. We collect a large-scale dataset of the metadata of 3 billion Bitmoji stickers shared among 300 million Snapchat users. We find that individual Bitmoji sticker usage patterns can be characterized jointly on dimensions of reciprocity and selectivity: Users are either both reciprocal and selective about whom they use Bitmoji stickers with or neither reciprocal nor selective. We additionally provide evidence of network homophily in that friends use Bitmoji stickers at similar rates. Finally, using a quasi-experimental approach, we show that receiving Bitmoji stickers from a friend encourages future Bitmoji sticker usage and overall Snapchat engagement. We discuss broader implications of our work towards a better understanding of pictorial communication behaviors in social networks. ",

We achieve average 8.98\\% and 2.70\\% for hypernym and LCA discovery across five languages and 62.76\\% accuracy on directed Wiki-page link recovery, with both substantially above baselines.

Here, we introduce cross-stitch bi-encoders, which allow full interaction between the text encoder and the KG encoder via a cross-stitch mechanism. The cross-stitch mechanism allows sharing and updating representations between the two encoders at any layer, with the amount of sharing being dynamically controlled via cross-attention-based gates. Experimental results on two relation extraction benchmarks from two different domains show that enabling full interaction between the two encoders yields strong improvements. ",

We first introduce a new task, entity-to-entity (E2E) stance detection, which primes models to identify entities in their canonical names and discern stances jointly. To support this study, we curate a new dataset with 10,619 annotations labeled at the sentence-level from news articles of different ideological leanings. We present a novel generative framework to allow the generation of canonical names for entities as well as stances among them. We further enhance the model with a graph encoder to summarize entity activities and external knowledge surrounding the entities.

Further analyses demonstrate the usefulness of E2E stance detection for understanding media quotation and stance landscape, as well as inferring entity ideology. ",

Short of storing all effective resistances, previous best approaches could achieve $\\widetilde{O}(n\\epsilon^{-2})$ size and $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ time per query by storing Johnson-Lindenstrauss vectors for each vertex, or $\\widetilde{O}(n\\epsilon^{-1})$ size and $\\widetilde{O}(n\\epsilon^{-1})$ time per query by storing a spectral sketch. Our construction is based on two key ideas: 1) $\\epsilon^{-1}$-sparse, $\\epsilon$-additive approximations to $DL^+1_u$ for all $u,$ can be used to recover $(1 + \\epsilon)$-approximations to the effective resistances, 2) In expander graphs, only $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon^{-1})$ coordinates of a vector similar to $DL^+1_u$ are larger than $\\epsilon.$ We give an efficient construction for such a data structure in $\\widetilde{O}(m + n\\epsilon^{-2})$ time via random walks. This results in an algorithm for computing $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate effective resistances for $s$ vertex pairs in expanders that runs in $\\widetilde{O}(m + n\\epsilon^{-2} + s)$ time, improving over the previously best known running time of $m^{1 + o(1)} + (n + s)n^{o(1)}\\epsilon^{-1.5}$ for $s = \\omega(n\\epsilon^{-0.5}).$ We employ the above algorithm to compute a $(1+\\delta)$-approximation to the number of spanning trees in an expander graph, or equivalently, approximating the (pseudo)determinant of its Laplacian in $\\widetilde{O}(m + n^{1.5}\\delta^{-1})$ time. This improves on the previously best known result of $m^{1+o(1)} + n^{1.875+o(1)}\\delta^{-1.75}$ time, and matches the best known size of determinant sparsifiers. ",

    "abstract": "Convergence rates of block iterations for solving eigenvalue problems typically measure errors of Ritz values approximating eigenvalues. The errors of the Ritz values are commonly bounded in terms of principal angles between the initial or iterative subspace and the invariant subspace associated with the target eigenvalues. Such bounds thus cannot be applied repeatedly as needed for restarted block eigensolvers, since the left- and right-hand sides of the bounds use different terms. They must be combined with additional bounds which could cause an overestimation. Alternative repeatable bounds that are angle-free and depend only on the errors of the Ritz values have been pioneered for Hermitian eigenvalue problems in doi:10.1515/rnam.1987.2.5.371 but only for a single extreme Ritz value. We extend this result to all Ritz values and achieve robustness for clustered eigenvalues by utilizing nonconsecutive eigenvalues. Our new bounds cover the restarted block Lanczos method and its modifications with shift-and-invert and deflation, and are numerically advantageous. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) for rich speech representations has achieved empirical success in low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and other speech processing tasks, which can mitigate the necessity of a large amount of transcribed speech and thus has driven a growing demand for on-device ASR and other speech processing. However, advanced speech SSL models have become increasingly large, which contradicts the limited on-device resources. This gap could be more severe in multilingual/multitask scenarios requiring simultaneously recognizing multiple languages or executing multiple speech processing tasks. Additionally, strongly overparameterized speech SSL models tend to suffer from overfitting when being finetuned on low-resource speech corpus. This work aims to enhance the practical usage of speech SSL models towards a win-win in both enhanced efficiency and alleviated overfitting via our proposed S$^3$-Router framework, which for the first time discovers that simply discarding no more than 10\\% of model weights via only finetuning model connections of speech SSL models can achieve better accuracy over standard weight finetuning on downstream speech processing tasks. More importantly, S$^3$-Router can serve as an all-in-one technique to enable (1) a new finetuning scheme, (2) an efficient multilingual/multitask solution, (3) a state-of-the-art ASR pruning technique, and (4) a new tool to quantitatively analyze the learned speech representation. We believe S$^3$-Router has provided a new perspective for practical deployment of speech SSL models. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/S3-Router. ",

Malware behaviors are polymorphic, metamorphic, persistent, able to hide to bypass detectors and adapt to new environments, and even leverage machine learning techniques to better damage targets. Thus, it makes them difficult to analyze and detect with traditional endpoint detection and response, intrusion detection and prevention systems. To defend against malwares, recent work has proposed different techniques based on signatures and machine learning. In this paper, we propose to use an algebraic topological approach called topological-based data analysis (TDA) to efficiently analyze and detect complex malware patterns. Next, we compare the different TDA techniques (i.e., persistence homology, tomato, TDA Mapper) and existing techniques (i.e., PCA, UMAP, t-SNE) using different classifiers including random forest, decision tree, xgboost, and lightgbm. We also propose some recommendations to deploy the best-identified models for malware detection at scale. Results show that TDA Mapper (combined with PCA) is better for clustering and for identifying hidden relationships between malware clusters compared to PCA. Persistent diagrams are better to identify overlapping malware clusters with low execution time compared to UMAP and t-SNE. For malware detection, malware analysts can use Random Forest and Decision Tree with t-SNE and Persistent Diagram to achieve better performance and robustness on noised data. ",

The paper presents two predictive runtime verification algorithms that predict future system states from the current observed system trajectory. As these predictions may not be accurate, we construct prediction regions that quantify prediction uncertainty by using conformal prediction, a statistical tool for uncertainty quantification. Our first algorithm directly constructs a prediction region for the satisfaction measure of the specification so that we can predict specification violations with a desired confidence. The second algorithm constructs prediction regions for future system states first, and uses these to obtain a prediction region for the satisfaction measure. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first formal guarantees for a predictive runtime verification algorithm that applies to widely used trajectory predictors such as RNNs and LSTMs, while being computationally simple and making no assumptions on the underlying distribution.

To solve the problem, we propose a two-stage training method based on the local features of the real loss. We first search low forgetting risk regions, where the model can retain the performance on the previous task as the parameters are updated, to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem. Then we can continually train the model within this region only with the new training data to fit the new task. Specifically, we propose two methods to search the low forgetting risk regions, which are based on the curvature of loss and the impacts of the parameters on the model output, respectively. We conduct experiments on domain adaptation and more challenging language adaptation tasks, and the experimental results show that our method can achieve significant improvements compared with several strong baselines.

    "abstract": "The ground plane prior is a very informative geometry clue in monocular 3D object detection (M3OD). However, it has been neglected by most mainstream methods. In this paper, we identify two key factors that limit the applicability of ground plane prior: the projection point localization issue and the ground plane tilt issue. To pick up the ground plane prior for M3OD, we propose a Ground Plane Enhanced Network (GPENet) which resolves both issues at one go. For the projection point localization issue, instead of using the bottom vertices or bottom center of the 3D bounding box (BBox), we leverage the object's ground contact points, which are explicit pixels in the image and easy for the neural network to detect. For the ground plane tilt problem, our GPENet estimates the horizon line in the image and derives a novel mathematical expression to accurately estimate the ground plane equation. An unsupervised vertical edge mining algorithm is also proposed to address the occlusion of the horizon line. Furthermore, we design a novel 3D bounding box deduction method based on a dynamic back projection algorithm, which could take advantage of the accurate contact points and the ground plane equation. Additionally, using only M3OD labels, contact point and horizon line pseudo labels can be easily generated with NO extra data collection and label annotation cost. Extensive experiments on the popular KITTI benchmark show that our GPENet can outperform other methods and achieve state-of-the-art performance, well demonstrating the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed approach. Moreover, our GPENet works better than other methods in cross-dataset evaluation on the nuScenes dataset. Our code and models will be published. ",

We developed a novel Transformer-based architecture, PIGINet, that predicts plan feasibility based on the initial state, goal, and candidate plans, fusing image and text embeddings with state features. The model sorts the plan skeletons produced by a TAMP planner according to the predicted satisfiability likelihoods. We evaluate the runtime of our learning-enabled TAMP algorithm on several distributions of kitchen rearrangement problems, comparing its performance to that of non-learning baselines and algorithm ablations. Our experiments show that PIGINet substantially improves planning efficiency, cutting down runtime by 80% on average on pick-and-place problems with articulated obstacles.

    "title": "Open-Vocabulary Argument Role Prediction for Event Extraction",
    "abstract": "The argument role in event extraction refers to the relation between an event and an argument participating in it. Despite the great progress in event extraction, existing studies still depend on roles pre-defined by domain experts. These studies expose obvious weakness when extending to emerging event types or new domains without available roles. Therefore, more attention and effort needs to be devoted to automatically customizing argument roles. In this paper, we define this essential but under-explored task: open-vocabulary argument role prediction. The goal of this task is to infer a set of argument roles for a given event type. We propose a novel unsupervised framework, RolePred for this task. Specifically, we formulate the role prediction problem as an in-filling task and construct prompts for a pre-trained language model to generate candidate roles. By extracting and analyzing the candidate arguments, the event-specific roles are further merged and selected. To standardize the research of this task, we collect a new event extraction dataset from WikiPpedia including 142 customized argument roles with rich semantics. On this dataset, RolePred outperforms the existing methods by a large margin. Source code and dataset are available on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/yzjiao/RolePred ",

    "abstract": "Several companies often safeguard their trained deep models (i.e. details of architecture, learnt weights, training details etc.) from third-party users by exposing them only as black boxes through APIs. Moreover, they may not even provide access to the training data due to proprietary reasons or sensitivity concerns. We make the first attempt to provide adversarial robustness to the black box models in a data-free set up. We construct synthetic data via generative model and train surrogate network using model stealing techniques. To minimize adversarial contamination on perturbed samples, we propose `wavelet noise remover' (WNR) that performs discrete wavelet decomposition on input images and carefully select only a few important coefficients determined by our `wavelet coefficient selection module' (WCSM). To recover the high-frequency content of the image after noise removal via WNR, we further train a `regenerator' network with an objective to retrieve the coefficients such that the reconstructed image yields similar to original predictions on the surrogate model. At test time, WNR combined with trained regenerator network is prepended to the black box network, resulting in a high boost in adversarial accuracy. Our method improves the adversarial accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 38.98% and 32.01% on state-of-the-art Auto Attack compared to baseline, even when the attacker uses surrogate architecture (Alexnet-half and Alexnet) similar to the black box architecture (Alexnet) with same model stealing strategy as defender.

    "title": "Try to Avoid Attacks: A Federated Data Sanitization Defense for  Healthcare IoMT Systems",
    "abstract": "Healthcare IoMT systems are becoming intelligent, miniaturized, and more integrated into daily life. As for the distributed devices in the IoMT, federated learning has become a topical area with cloud-based training procedures when meeting data security. However, the distribution of IoMT has the risk of protection from data poisoning attacks. Poisoned data can be fabricated by falsifying medical data, which urges a security defense to IoMT systems. Due to the lack of specific labels, the filtering of malicious data is a unique unsupervised scenario. One of the main challenges is finding robust data filtering methods for various poisoning attacks. This paper introduces a Federated Data Sanitization Defense, a novel approach to protect the system from data poisoning attacks. To solve this unsupervised problem, we first use federated learning to project all the data to the subspace domain, allowing unified feature mapping to be established since the data is stored locally. Then we adopt the federated clustering to re-group their features to clarify the poisoned data. The clustering is based on the consistent association of data and its semantics. After we get the clustering of the private data, we do the data sanitization with a simple yet efficient strategy. In the end, each device of distributed ImOT is enabled to filter malicious data according to federated data sanitization. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed defense method against data poisoning attacks. Further, we consider our approach in the different poisoning ratios and achieve a high Accuracy and a low attack success rate. ",

    "abstract": "The high cost of acquiring and annotating samples has made the `few-shot' learning problem of prime importance. Existing works mainly focus on improving performance on clean data and overlook robustness concerns on the data perturbed with adversarial noise. Recently, a few efforts have been made to combine the few-shot problem with the robustness objective using sophisticated Meta-Learning techniques. These methods rely on the generation of adversarial samples in every episode of training, which further adds a computational burden. To avoid such time-consuming and complicated procedures, we propose a simple but effective alternative that does not require any adversarial samples. Inspired by the cognitive decision-making process in humans, we enforce high-level feature matching between the base class data and their corresponding low-frequency samples in the pretraining stage via self distillation. The model is then fine-tuned on the samples of novel classes where we additionally improve the discriminability of low-frequency query set features via cosine similarity. On a 1-shot setting of the CIFAR-FS dataset, our method yields a massive improvement of $60.55\\%$ & $62.05\\%$ in adversarial accuracy on the PGD and state-of-the-art Auto Attack, respectively, with a minor drop in clean accuracy compared to the baseline. Moreover, our method only takes $1.69\\times$ of the standard training time while being $\\approx$ $5\\times$ faster than state-of-the-art adversarial meta-learning methods.

We then cast nerf2nerf registration as a robust optimization that iteratively seeks a rigid transformation that aligns the surface fields of the two scenes. We evaluate the effectiveness of our technique by introducing a dataset of pre-trained NeRF scenes -- our synthetic scenes enable quantitative evaluations and comparisons to classical registration techniques, while our real scenes demonstrate the validity of our technique in real-world scenarios.

Due to the warmer and drier conditions created by climate change, more severe and uncontrollable wildfires are expected to occur in the coming years. This could lead to a global wildfire crisis and have dire consequences on our planet. Hence, it has become imperative to use technology to help prevent the spread of wildfires. One way to prevent the spread of wildfires before they become too large is to perform early detection i.e, detecting the smoke before the actual fire starts. In this paper, we present our Wildfire Detection and Alert System which use machine learning to detect wildfire smoke with a high degree of accuracy and can send immediate alerts to users. Our technology is currently being used in the USA to monitor data coming in from hundreds of cameras daily. We show that our system has a high true detection rate and a low false detection rate. Our performance evaluation study also shows that on an average our system detects wildfire smoke faster than an actual person. ",

It allows the planner to identify potential conflicts with other traffic agents and generate safe plans. Existing motion predictors often focus on reducing prediction errors, yet it remains an open question on how well they help identify the conflicts for the planner. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art predictors through novel conflict-related metrics, such as the success rate of identifying conflicts. Surprisingly, the predictors suffer from a low success rate and thus lead to a large percentage of collisions when we test the prediction-planning system in an interactive simulator. To fill the gap, we propose a simple but effective alternative that combines a physics-based trajectory generator and a learning-based relation predictor to identify conflicts and infer conflict relations. We demonstrate that our predictor, P4P, achieves superior performance over existing learning-based predictors in realistic interactive driving scenarios from Waymo Open Motion Dataset. ",

The current adversarial attacks in computer vision can be divided into digital attacks and physical attacks according to their different attack forms. Compared with digital attacks, which generate perturbations in the digital pixels, physical attacks are more practical in the real world. Owing to the serious security problem caused by physically adversarial examples, many works have been proposed to evaluate the physically adversarial robustness of DNNs in the past years. In this paper, we summarize a survey versus the current physically adversarial attacks and physically adversarial defenses in computer vision. To establish a taxonomy, we organize the current physical attacks from attack tasks, attack forms, and attack methods, respectively. Thus, readers can have a systematic knowledge about this topic from different aspects. For the physical defenses, we establish the taxonomy from pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing for the DNN models to achieve a full coverage of the adversarial defenses. Based on the above survey, we finally discuss the challenges of this research field and further outlook the future direction. ",

We have also applied some traditional machine learning classifiers such as Nave Bayes (NB), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect spam reviews and finally, we have shown the performance comparison for both traditional and deep learning classifiers.

However, extracting attack patterns at scale is a challenging task. In this paper, we present LADDER, a knowledge extraction framework that can extract text-based attack patterns from CTI reports at scale.

Low/medium interaction honeypots offer a promising lightweight defense for actively protecting mobile Internet of things, particularly UAV networks. While previous research has primarily focused on honeypot system design and attack pattern recognition, the incentive issue for motivating UAV's participation (e.g., sharing trapped attack data in honeypots) to collaboratively resist distributed and sophisticated attacks remains unexplored. This paper proposes a novel game-theoretical collaborative defense approach to address optimal, fair, and feasible incentive design, in the presence of network dynamics and UAVs' multi-dimensional private information (e.g., valid defense data (VDD) volume, communication delay, and UAV cost). Specifically, we first develop a honeypot game between UAVs and the network operator under both partial and complete information asymmetry scenarios. The optimal VDD-reward contract design problem with partial information asymmetry is then solved using a contract-theoretic approach that ensures budget feasibility, truthfulness, fairness, and computational efficiency. In addition, under complete information asymmetry, we devise a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically design optimal contracts for distinct types of UAVs in the time-varying UAV network. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme can motivate UAV's cooperation in VDD sharing and improve defensive effectiveness, compared with conventional schemes. ",

In both cases, the coarse-grained structure plays an important role in simplifying the network and improving both the interpretability and efficiency.

For example, while evidence suggests that action recognition algorithms are heavily influenced by visual appearance in single frames, no quantitative methodology exists for evaluating such static bias in the latent representation compared to bias toward dynamics. We tackle this challenge by proposing an approach for quantifying the static and dynamic biases of any spatiotemporal model, and apply our approach to three tasks, action recognition, automatic video object segmentation (AVOS) and video instance segmentation (VIS). Our key findings are: (i) Most examined models are biased toward static information. (ii) Some datasets that are assumed to be biased toward dynamics are actually biased toward static information. (iii) Individual channels in an architecture can be biased toward static, dynamic or a combination of the two. (iv) Most models converge to their culminating biases in the first half of training. We then explore how these biases affect performance on dynamically biased datasets. For action recognition, we propose StaticDropout, a semantically guided dropout that debiases a model from static information toward dynamics. For AVOS, we design a better combination of fusion and cross connection layers compared with previous architectures. ",

    "title": "Beyond Instance Discrimination: Relation-aware Contrastive  Self-supervised Learning",
    "abstract": "Contrastive self-supervised learning (CSL) based on instance discrimination typically attracts positive samples while repelling negatives to learn representations with pre-defined binary self-supervision. However, vanilla CSL is inadequate in modeling sophisticated instance relations, limiting the learned model to retain fine semantic structure. On the one hand, samples with the same semantic category are inevitably pushed away as negatives. On the other hand, differences among samples cannot be captured. In this paper, we present relation-aware contrastive self-supervised learning (ReCo) to integrate instance relations, i.e., global distribution relation and local interpolation relation, into the CSL framework in a plug-and-play fashion. Specifically, we align similarity distributions calculated between the positive anchor views and the negatives at the global level to exploit diverse similarity relations among instances. Local-level interpolation consistency between the pixel space and the feature space is applied to quantitatively model the feature differences of samples with distinct apparent similarities. Through explicitly instance relation modeling, our ReCo avoids irrationally pushing away semantically identical samples and carves a well-structured feature space. Extensive experiments conducted on commonly used benchmarks justify that our ReCo consistently gains remarkable performance improvements. ",

    "abstract": "Joint entity and relation extraction has been a core task in the field of information extraction. Recent approaches usually consider the extraction of relational triples from a stereoscopic perspective, either learning a relation-specific tagger or separate classifiers for each relation type. However, they still suffer from error propagation, relation redundancy and lack of high-level connections between triples. To address these issues, we propose a novel query-based approach to construct instance-level representations for relational triples. By metric-based comparison between query embeddings and token embeddings, we can extract all types of triples in one step, thus eliminating the error propagation problem. In addition, we learn the instance-level representation of relational triples via contrastive learning. In this way, relational triples can not only enclose rich class-level semantics but also access to high-order global connections. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the state of the art on five widely used benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. The backdoor adversaries intend to maliciously control the predictions of attacked DNNs by injecting hidden backdoors that can be activated by adversary-specified trigger patterns during the training process. One recent research revealed that most of the existing attacks failed in the real physical world since the trigger contained in the digitized test samples may be different from that of the one used for training. Accordingly, users can adopt spatial transformations as the image pre-processing to deactivate hidden backdoors. In this paper, we explore the previous findings from another side. We exploit classical spatial transformations (i.e. rotation and translation) with the specific parameter as trigger patterns to design a simple yet effective poisoning-based backdoor attack. For example, only images rotated to a particular angle can activate the embedded backdoor of attacked DNNs. Extensive experiments are conducted, verifying the effectiveness of our attack under both digital and physical settings and its resistance to existing backdoor defenses. ",

This develops a need for the study on the ranking-based group identification (RGI) task, i.e., recommending groups to users. The major challenge in this task is how to effectively and efficiently leverage both the item interaction and group participation of users' online behaviors. Though recent developments of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) succeed in simultaneously aggregating both social and user-item interaction, they however fail to comprehensively resolve this RGI task. In this paper, we propose a novel GNN-based framework named Contextualized Factorized Attention for Group identification (CFAG). We devise tripartite graph convolution layers to aggregate information from different types of neighborhoods among users, groups, and items. To cope with the data sparsity issue, we devise a novel propagation augmentation (PA) layer, which is based on our proposed factorized attention mechanism. PA layers efficiently learn the relatedness of non-neighbor nodes to improve the information propagation to users. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets verify the superiority of CFAG. Additional detailed investigations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. ",

Further, we propose a Bayesian Optimization strategy to efficiently search over such huge spaces, and demonstrate empirically that both our search space design and our search strategy can be superior to existing baselines.

In this paper, we aim to tackle this fundamental yet challenging problem by providing an effective hyperparameter tuning framework with differential privacy. The proposed method allows us to adopt a broader hyperparameter search space and even to perform a grid search over the whole space, since its privacy loss parameter is independent of the number of hyperparameter candidates. Interestingly, it instead correlates with the utility gained from hyperparameter searching, revealing an explicit and mandatory trade-off between privacy and utility. Theoretically, we show that its additional privacy loss bound incurred by hyperparameter tuning is upper-bounded by the squared root of the gained utility. However, we note that the additional privacy loss bound would empirically scale like a squared root of the logarithm of the utility term, benefiting from the design of doubling step. ",

However, despite their successes, such simulations usually rely on highly computationally expensive numerical modelling, which is often inefficient to adapt to new simulation parameters. This limits their use in dynamic models of human behavior, for example in modelling the electric fields generated by muscles in a moving arm. We propose the alternative approach to use conditional generative models, which can learn complex relationships between the underlying generative conditions whilst remaining inexpensive to sample from. As a demonstration of this concept, we present BioMime, a hybrid architecture that combines elements of deep latent variable models and conditional adversarial training to construct a generative model that can both transform existing data samples to reflect new modelling assumptions and sample new data from a conditioned distribution. We demonstrate that BioMime can learn to accurately mimic a complex numerical model of human muscle biophysics and then use this knowledge to continuously sample from a dynamically changing system in real-time. We argue that transfer learning approaches with conditional generative models are a viable solution for dynamic simulation with any numerical model. ",

However, it has already been pointed out empirically that linear models on many tasks can outperform graph auto-encoders. In our work, we prove that the solution space induced by graph auto-encoders is a subset of the solution space of a linear map. This demonstrates that linear embedding models have at least the representational power of graph auto-encoders based on graph convolutional networks. So why are we still using nonlinear graph auto-encoders? One reason could be that actively restricting the linear solution space might introduce an inductive bias that helps improve learning and generalization. While many researchers believe that the nonlinearity of the encoder is the critical ingredient towards this end, we instead identify the node features of the graph as a more powerful inductive bias. We give theoretical insights by introducing a corresponding bias in a linear model and analyzing the change in the solution space. Our experiments show that the linear encoder can outperform the nonlinear encoder when using feature information. ",

In contrast, we explore an approach to integrate contextual information as text which aligns better with transformer architectures. Specifically, we train a model consisting of dual encoders which exchange information via cross-attention. This architecture allows for integrating contextual information from heterogeneous sources. We evaluate context extracted from structured knowledge sources and from prompting large language models.

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. A backdoor DNN model behaves normally with clean inputs, whereas outputs attacker's expected behaviors when the inputs contain a pre-defined pattern called a trigger. However, in some tasks, the attacker cannot know the exact target that shows his/her expected behavior, because the task may contain a large number of classes and the attacker does not have full access to know the semantic details of these classes. Thus, the attacker is willing to attack multiple suspected targets to achieve his/her purpose. In light of this, in this paper, we propose the M-to-N backdoor attack, a new attack paradigm that allows an attacker to launch a fuzzy attack by simultaneously attacking N suspected targets, and each of the N targets can be activated by any one of its M triggers. To achieve a better stealthiness, we randomly select M clean images from the training dataset as our triggers for each target. Since the triggers used in our attack have the same distribution as the clean images, the inputs poisoned by the triggers are difficult to be detected by the input-based defenses, and the backdoor models trained on the poisoned training dataset are also difficult to be detected by the model-based defenses. Thus, our attack is stealthier and has a higher probability of achieving the attack purpose by attacking multiple suspected targets simultaneously in contrast to prior backdoor attacks. Extensive experiments show that our attack is effective against different datasets with various models and achieves high attack success rates (e.g., 99.43% for attacking 2 targets and 98.23% for attacking 4 targets on the CIFAR-10 dataset) when poisoning only an extremely small portion of the training dataset (e.g., less than 2%). Besides, it is robust to pre-processing operations and can resist state-of-the-art defenses. ",

Hence, we need to design model selection techniques that do not explicitly rely on counterfactual data. As an alternative to cross-validation, there have been a variety of proxy metrics proposed in the literature, that depend on auxiliary nuisance models also estimated from the data (propensity score model, outcome regression model). However, the effectiveness of these metrics has only been studied on synthetic datasets as we can observe the counterfactual data for them. We conduct an extensive empirical analysis to judge the performance of these metrics, where we utilize the latest advances in generative modeling to incorporate multiple realistic datasets. We evaluate 9 metrics on 144 datasets for selecting between 415 estimators per dataset, including datasets that closely mimic real-world datasets. Further, we use the latest techniques from AutoML to ensure consistent hyperparameter selection for nuisance models for a fair comparison across metrics. ",

    "abstract": "Graph representation learning is a fundamental research issue and benefits a wide range of applications on graph-structured data. Conventional artificial neural network-based methods such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and variational graph auto-encoders (VGAEs) have achieved promising results in learning on graphs, but they suffer from extremely high energy consumption during training and inference stages. Inspired by the bio-fidelity and energy-efficiency of spiking neural networks (SNNs), recent methods attempt to adapt GNNs to the SNN framework by substituting spiking neurons for the activation functions. However, existing SNN-based GNN methods cannot be applied to the more general multi-node representation learning problem represented by link prediction. Moreover, these methods did not fully exploit the bio-fidelity of SNNs, as they still require costly multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, which severely harm the energy efficiency. To address the above issues and improve energy efficiency, in this paper, we propose an SNN-based deep generative method, namely the Spiking Variational Graph Auto-Encoders (S-VGAE) for efficient graph representation learning. To deal with the multi-node problem, we propose a probabilistic decoder that generates binary latent variables as spiking node representations and reconstructs graphs via the weighted inner product. To avoid the MAC operations for energy efficiency, we further decouple the propagation and transformation layers of conventional GNN aggregators. We conduct link prediction experiments on multiple benchmark graph datasets, and the results demonstrate that our model consumes significantly lower energy with the performances superior or comparable to other ANN- and SNN-based methods for graph representation learning.

    "abstract": "Social media has become an essential part of the modern lifestyle, with its usage being highly prevalent. This has resulted in unprecedented amounts of data generated from users in social media, such as users' attitudes, opinions, interests, purchases, and activities across various aspects of their lives. Therefore, in a world of social media, where its power has shifted to users, actions taken by companies and public figures are subject to constantly being under scrutiny by influential global audiences. As a result, reputation management in social media has become essential as companies and public figures need to maintain their reputation to preserve their reputation capital. However, domain experts still face the challenge of lacking appropriate solutions to automate reliable online reputation analysis. To tackle this challenge, we proposed a novel reputation analysis approach based on the popular language model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). The proposed approach was evaluated on the reputational polarity task using RepLab 2013 dataset. Compared to previous works, we achieved 5.8% improvement in accuracy, 26.9% improvement in balanced accuracy, and 21.8% improvement in terms of F-score. ",

However, it is difficult to find a satisfactory compromise solution in a reasonable time due to the complexity of solution space searching. To solve this problem, we first formulate a multi-objective optimization problem based on a sub-network of the full model and propose a Sub-network Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (SMOEA) for filter pruning. By progressively pruning the convolutional layers in groups, SMOEA can obtain a lightweight pruned result with better performance.Experiments on VGG-14 model for CIFAR-10 verify the effectiveness of the proposed SMOEA. Specifically, the accuracy of the pruned model with 16.56% parameters decreases by 0.28% only, which is better than the widely used popular filter pruning criteria. ",

    "abstract": "The goal of this work is to localize sound sources in visual scenes with a self-supervised approach. Contrastive learning in the context of sound source localization leverages the natural correspondence between audio and visual signals where the audio-visual pairs from the same source are assumed as positive, while randomly selected pairs are negatives. However, this approach brings in noisy correspondences; for example, positive audio and visual pair signals that may be unrelated to each other, or negative pairs that may contain semantically similar samples to the positive one. Our key contribution in this work is to show that using a less strict decision boundary in contrastive learning can alleviate the effect of noisy correspondences in sound source localization. We propose a simple yet effective approach by slightly modifying the contrastive loss with a negative margin. Extensive experimental results show that our approach gives on-par or better performance than the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the introduction of a negative margin to existing methods results in a consistent improvement in performance. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for jointly grounding objects that follow certain semantic relationship constraints given in a scene graph. A typical natural scene contains several objects, often exhibiting visual relationships of varied complexities between them. These inter-object relationships provide strong contextual cues toward improving grounding performance compared to a traditional object query-only-based localization task. A scene graph is an efficient and structured way to represent all the objects and their semantic relationships in the image. In an attempt towards bridging these two modalities representing scenes and utilizing contextual information for improving object localization, we rigorously study the problem of grounding scene graphs on natural images. To this end, we propose a novel graph neural network-based approach referred to as Visio-Lingual Message PAssing Graph Neural Network (VL-MPAG Net). In VL-MPAG Net, we first construct a directed graph with object proposals as nodes and an edge between a pair of nodes representing a plausible relation between them. Then a three-step inter-graph and intra-graph message passing is performed to learn the context-dependent representation of the proposals and query objects. These object representations are used to score the proposals to generate object localization. The proposed method significantly outperforms the baselines on four public datasets. ",

Our method involves a patent embedding that captures text, citation, and inventor information, which individually represent different facets of knowledge communicated through a patent document. We obtain text embeddings using Sentence-BERT applied to titles and abstracts. We obtain citation and inventor embeddings through TransE that is trained using the corresponding knowledge graphs. We identify using a classification task that the concatenation of text, citation, and inventor embeddings offers a plausible representation of a patent. While the proposed patent embedding could be used to associate a pair of patents, we observe using a recall task that multiple initial patents could be associated with a target patent using mean cosine similarity, which could then be utilized to rank all target patents and retrieve the most relevant ones. We apply the proposed patent retrieval method to a set of patents corresponding to a product family and an inventor's portfolio. ",

Existing mechanisms have been designed to solve the challenge in various settings, aiming at desirable properties such as non-deficiency, incentive compatibility and social welfare maximization. Since the mechanisms are employed in dynamic networks with ever-changing structures, buyers could easily generate fake nodes in the network to manipulate the mechanisms for their own benefits, which is commonly known as the Sybil attack. We observe that strategic agents may gain an unfair advantage in existing mechanisms through such attacks. To resist this potential attack, we propose two diffusion auction mechanisms, the Sybil tax mechanism (STM) and the Sybil cluster mechanism (SCM), to achieve both Sybil-proofness and incentive compatibility in the single-item setting. Our proposal provides the first mechanisms to protect the interests of buyers against Sybil attacks with a mild sacrifice of social welfare and revenue. ",

A future-oriented education on critical issues, such as those outlined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and designing potential solutions for such problems is an imperative skill that must be imparted to children to help them navigate their future in today's unpredictable world. Towards this goal, we have been conducting 3.5 month-long mentoring programs for pre-university students in India to participate in a STEAM for Social Good innovation challenge conducted annually by the Government of India. Using digital and physical computing skills, we helped children explore creative solutions for social problems through a constructionist approach to learning, wherein they ideated and reflected upon the problems in their communities. The children learnt the Engineering Design Thinking process and worked in online groups of two or three, from concept to completion. Despite the constraints posed by the pandemic, they explored creative ways to think about design and innovation. They completed a variety of tasks by making, tinkering, engineering, assembling, and programming to grasp the intricate relationship between software and hardware. Subsequently, the children showcased their creative abilities through video storytelling to a panel of domain experts. In this paper, we present the children's perspective of their experiences through this journey, the evaluation metrics based on IEEE design principles, and our learnings from conducting this initiative as a university-school partnership model for 84 middle and high school students. The aspirational intent of this initiative is to make the children better social problem solvers and help them perceive social problems as opportunities to enhance life for themselves and their communities.

    "abstract": "Quantitative phase retrieval (QPR) in propagation-based x-ray phase contrast imaging of heterogeneous and structurally complicated objects is challenging under laboratory conditions due to partial spatial coherence and polychromaticity. A learning-based method (LBM) provides a non-linear approach to this problem while not being constrained by restrictive assumptions about object properties and beam coherence. In this work, a LBM was assessed for its applicability under practical scenarios by evaluating its robustness and generalizability under typical experimental variations. Towards this end, an end-to-end LBM was employed for QPR under laboratory conditions and its robustness was investigated across various system and object conditions. The robustness of the method was tested via varying propagation distances and its generalizability with respect to object structure and experimental data was also tested. Although the LBM was stable under the studied variations, its successful deployment was found to be affected by choices pertaining to data pre-processing, network training considerations and system modeling. To our knowledge, we demonstrated for the first time, the potential applicability of an end-to-end learning-based quantitative phase retrieval method, trained on simulated data, to experimental propagation-based x-ray phase contrast measurements acquired under laboratory conditions. We considered conditions of polychromaticity, partial spatial coherence, and high noise levels, typical to laboratory conditions. This work further explored the robustness of this method to practical variations in propagation distances and object structure with the goal of assessing its potential for experimental use. Such an exploration of any LBM (irrespective of its network architecture) before practical deployment provides an understanding of its potential behavior under experimental settings. ",

    "abstract": "Optical photons are used as signal in a wide variety of particle detectors. Modern neutrino experiments employ hundreds to tens of thousands of photon detectors to observe signal from millions to billions of scintillation photons produced from energy deposition of charged particles. These neutrino detectors are typically large, containing kilotons of target volume, with different optical properties. Modeling individual photon propagation in form of look-up table requires huge computational resources. As the size of a table increases with detector volume for a fixed resolution, this method scales poorly for future larger detectors. Alternative approaches such as fitting a polynomial to the model could address the memory issue, but results in poorer performance. Both look-up table and fitting approaches are prone to discrepancies between the detector simulation and the data collected. We propose a new approach using SIREN, an implicit neural representation with periodic activation functions, to model the look-up table as a 3D scene and reproduces the acceptance map with high accuracy. The number of parameters in our SIREN model is orders of magnitude smaller than the number of voxels in the look-up table. As it models an underlying functional shape, SIREN is scalable to a larger detector. Furthermore, SIREN can successfully learn the spatial gradients of the photon library, providing additional information for downstream applications. Finally, as SIREN is a neural network representation, it is differentiable with respect to its parameters, and therefore tunable via gradient descent. We demonstrate the potential of optimizing SIREN directly on real data, which mitigates the concern of data vs. simulation discrepancies. We further present an application for data reconstruction where SIREN is used to form a likelihood function for photon statistics. ",

Therefore, in this article, we propose a new framework to study the specific spatial influence patterns of the overall structure and different sub-structures of road networks on the mixed functions. Taking road segment as the basic unit, we characterize mixed functions aggregation of road networks with the number of POIs categories within 100 meters around every road segment. At the same time, on the basis of centrality measurement in graph theory, we use 4 indexes to reflect the characteristics of the urban road network structure, including degree, closeness, betweenness, and length. We conduct our methods and experiments using the road networks and POI data within the 5th ring road of Beijing. The results demonstrate that urban road networks inherently influence the aggregation of urban mixed functions in various patterns and the patterns of road network sub-structures is also quite different. Our study shows that the higher the degree of the road network structure has, the more likely it will attract functions' aggregation. It also reveals that diversified local degree will help gather urban functions. In addition to those, the analysis as well validates the importance of small-grids typology of urban road networks and the closeness to the center of cities. ",

This study proposes a novel method for self-supervised low-dose CT denoising to alleviate the requirement of paired LDCT and NDCT images. Specifically, we have trained an invertible neural network to minimize the pixel-based mean square distance between a noisy slice and the average of its two immediate adjacent noisy slices. We have shown the aforementioned is similar to training a neural network to minimize the distance between clean NDCT and noisy LDCT image pairs. Again, during the reverse mapping of the invertible network, the output image is mapped to the original input image, similar to cycle consistency loss. Finally, the trained invertible network's forward mapping is used for denoising LDCT images.

At the same time, adversarial attacks against deep ASR systems are highly successful. Various methods have been proposed to defend ASR systems from these attacks. However, existing classification based methods focus on the design of deep learning models while lacking exploration of domain specific features. This work leverages filter bank-based features to better capture the characteristics of attacks for improved detection. Furthermore, the paper analyses the potentials of using speech and non-speech parts separately in detecting adversarial attacks. In the end, considering adverse environments where ASR systems may be deployed, we study the impact of acoustic noise of various types and signal-to-noise ratios. Extensive experiments show that the inverse filter bank features generally perform better in both clean and noisy environments, the detection is effective using either speech or non-speech part, and the acoustic noise can largely degrade the detection performance.

After LHUC speaker adaptation, the best system using VAE-GAN based augmentation produced an overall WER of 27.78% on the UASpeech test set of 16 dysarthric speakers, and the lowest published WER of 57.31% on the subset of speakers with \"Very Low\" intelligibility.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel technique to obtain better downstream ASR performance from a joint encoder-decoder self-supervised model when trained with speech pooled from two different channels (narrow and wide band). The joint encoder-decoder self-supervised model extends the HuBERT model with a Transformer decoder. HuBERT performs clustering of features and predicts the class of every input frame. In simple pooling, which is our baseline, there is no way to identify the channel information. To incorporate channel information, we have proposed non-overlapping cluster IDs for speech from different channels. Our method gives a relative improvement of ~ 5% over the joint encoder-decoder self-supervised model built with simple pooling of data, which serves as our baseline. ",

We endow each of these sets with a geometric structure, inducing the notions of closeness and symmetries, by turning them into a vertex set of an appropriate metagraph. Building on this, we describe the class of priors that respect this structure and are analogous to the Euclidean isotropic processes, like squared exponential or Mat\\'ern. We propose an efficient computational technique for the ostensibly intractable problem of evaluating these priors' kernels, making such Gaussian processes usable within the usual toolboxes and downstream applications. We go further to consider sets of equivalence classes of unweighted graphs and define the appropriate versions of priors thereon. We prove a hardness result, showing that in this case, exact kernel computation cannot be performed efficiently. However, we propose a simple Monte Carlo approximation for handling moderately sized cases. Inspired by applications in chemistry, we illustrate the proposed techniques on a real molecular property prediction task in the small data regime. ",

    "abstract": "Acoustic-based fault detection has a high potential to monitor the health condition of mechanical parts. However, the background noise of an industrial environment may negatively influence the performance of fault detection. Limited attention has been paid to improving the robustness of fault detection against industrial environmental noise. Therefore, we present the Lenze production background-noise (LPBN) real-world dataset and an automated and noise-robust auditory inspection (ARAI) system for the end-of-line inspection of geared motors. An acoustic array is used to acquire data from motors with a minor fault, major fault, or which are healthy. A benchmark is provided to compare the psychoacoustic features with different types of envelope features based on expert knowledge of the gearbox. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply time-varying psychoacoustic features for fault detection. We train a state-of-the-art one-class-classifier, on samples from healthy motors and separate the faulty ones for fault detection using a threshold. The best-performing approaches achieve an area under curve of 0.87 (logarithm envelope), 0.86 (time-varying psychoacoustics), and 0.91 (combination of both). ",

    "abstract": "In the end-of-line test of geared motors, the evaluation of product qual-ity is important. Due to time constraints and the high diversity of variants, acous-tic measurements are more economical than vibration measurements. However, the acoustic data is affected by industrial disturbing noise. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the robustness of features used for anomaly detection in geared motor end-of-line testing. A real-world dataset with typical faults and acoustic disturbances is recorded by an acoustic array. This includes industrial noise from the production and systematically produced disturbances, used to compare the robustness. Overall, it is proposed to apply features extracted from a log-envelope spectrum together with psychoacoustic features. The anomaly de-tection is done by using the isolation forest or the more universal bagging random miner. Most disturbances can be circumvented, while the use of a hammer or air pressure often causes problems. In general, these results are important for condi-tion monitoring tasks that are based on acoustic or vibration measurements. Fur-thermore, a real-world problem description is presented to improve common sig-nal processing and machine learning tasks. ",

    "abstract": "When recognizing emotions from speech, we encounter two common problems: how to optimally capture emotion-relevant information from the speech signal and how to best quantify or categorize the noisy subjective emotion labels. Self-supervised pre-trained representations can robustly capture information from speech enabling state-of-the-art results in many downstream tasks including emotion recognition. However, better ways of aggregating the information across time need to be considered as the relevant emotion information is likely to appear piecewise and not uniformly across the signal. For the labels, we need to take into account that there is a substantial degree of noise that comes from the subjective human annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to attentive pooling based on correlations between the representations' coefficients combined with label smoothing, a method aiming to reduce the confidence of the classifier on the training labels. We evaluate our proposed approach on the benchmark dataset IEMOCAP, and demonstrate high performance surpassing that in the literature.

    "abstract": "Volume prediction is one of the fundamental objectives in the Fintech area, which is helpful for many downstream tasks, e.g., algorithmic trading. Previous methods mostly learn a universal model for different stocks. However, this kind of practice omits the specific characteristics of individual stocks by applying the same set of parameters for different stocks. On the other hand, learning different models for each stock would face data sparsity or cold start problems for many stocks with small capitalization. To take advantage of the data scale and the various characteristics of individual stocks, we propose a dual-process meta-learning method that treats the prediction of each stock as one task under the meta-learning framework. Our method can model the common pattern behind different stocks with a meta-learner, while modeling the specific pattern for each stock across time spans with stock-dependent parameters. Furthermore, we propose to mine the pattern of each stock in the form of a latent variable which is then used for learning the parameters for the prediction module. This makes the prediction procedure aware of the data pattern. Extensive experiments on volume predictions show that our method can improve the performance of various baseline models. Further analyses testify the effectiveness of our proposed meta-learning framework. ",

Apart from providing real-time segmentation of MRI scans, the proposed architecture does not need large amount of data to train the proposed lightweight U-Net. Moreover, no additional data augmentation step is required. The lightweight U-Net shows very promising results on BITE dataset and it achieves a mean intersection-over-union (IoU) of 89% while outperforming the standard benchmark algorithms. Additionally, this work demonstrates an effective use of the three perspective planes, instead of the original three-dimensional volumetric images, for simplified brain tumor segmentation. ",

The model targets the ionosphere at solar zenith ranging from 70 to 90 degrees, and as such only utilizes observations from the Mars Global Surveyor mission. The performance of different machine learning methods was compared in terms of root mean square error, coefficient of determination, and mean absolute error. The bagged regression trees method performed best out of all the evaluated methods. Furthermore, the optimized bagged regression trees model outperformed other Martian ionosphere models from the literature (MIRI and NeMars) in finding the peak electron density value, and the peak density height in terms of root-mean-square error and mean absolute error.

In this paper, we propose a new approach, namely Physics properties Enhanced Molecular Property prediction (PEMP), to utilize relations between molecular properties revealed by previous physics theory and physical chemistry studies. Specifically, we enhance the training of the chemical and physiological property predictors with related physics property prediction tasks. We design two different methods for PEMP, respectively based on multi-task learning and transfer learning. Both methods include a model-agnostic molecule representation module and a property prediction module. In our implementation, we adopt both the state-of-the-art molecule embedding models under the supervised learning paradigm and the pretraining paradigm as the molecule representation module of PEMP, respectively. Experimental results on public benchmark MoleculeNet show that the proposed methods have the ability to outperform corresponding state-of-the-art models. ",

Current approaches for dependence estimation, especially density-based approaches, lack in precision, robustness and/or interpretability (in terms of the type of dependence being estimated). We propose a two-step approach for dependence quantification between random variables: 1) We first decompose the probability density functions (PDF) of the variables involved in terms of multiple local moments of uncertainty that systematically and precisely identify the different regions of the PDF (with special emphasis on the tail-regions). 2) We then compute an optimal transport map to measure the geometric similarity between the corresponding sets of decomposed local uncertainty moments of the variables. Dependence is then determined by the degree of one-to-one correspondence between the respective uncertainty moments of the variables in the optimal transport map. We utilize a recently introduced Gaussian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) based framework for multi-moment uncertainty decomposition of the variables. Being based on the Gaussian RKHS, our approach is robust towards outliers and monotone transformations of data, while the multiple moments of uncertainty provide high resolution and interpretability of the type of dependence being quantified. We support these claims through some preliminary results using simulated data. ",
