    "title": "Optimizing the Age of Information in Mixed-Critical Wireless  Communication Networks",
    "abstract": "Beyond fifth generation wireless communication networks (B5G) are applied in many use-cases, such as industrial control systems, smart public transport, and power grids. Those applications require innovative techniques for timely transmission and increased wireless network capacities. Hence, this paper proposes optimizing the data freshness measured by the age of information (AoI) in dense internet of things (IoT) sensor-actuator networks. Given different priorities of data-streams, i.e., different sensitivities to outdated information, mixed-criticality is introduced by analyzing different functions of the age, i.e., we consider linear and exponential aging functions. An intricate non-convex optimization problem managing the physical transmission time and packet outage probability is derived. Such problem is tackled using stochastic reformulations, successive convex approximations, and fractional programming, resulting in an efficient iterative algorithm for AoI optimization. Simulation results validate the proposed scheme's performance in terms of AoI, mixed-criticality, and scalability. The proposed non-orthogonal transmission is shown to outperform an orthogonal access scheme in various deployment cases. Results emphasize the potential gains for dense B5G empowered IoT networks in minimizing the AoI. ",

    "abstract": "This study examines the relationship between H.264 video compression and the performance of an object detection network (YOLOv5). We curated a set of 50 surveillance videos and annotated targets of interest (people, bikes, and vehicles). Videos were encoded at 5 quality levels using Constant Rate Factor (CRF) values in the set {22,32,37,42,47}. YOLOv5 was applied to compressed videos and detection performance was analyzed at each CRF level. Test results indicate that the detection performance is generally robust to moderate levels of compression; using a CRF value of 37 instead of 22 leads to significantly reduced bitrates/file sizes without adversely affecting detection performance. However, detection performance degrades appreciably at higher compression levels, especially in complex scenes with poor lighting and fast-moving targets. Finally, retraining YOLOv5 on compressed imagery gives up to a 1% improvement in F1 score when applied to highly compressed footage. ",

Recent efforts, therefore, focus on collecting person-related datasets that have carefully selected labels, including sensitive characteristics, and consent forms in place to use those attributes for model testing and development. Responsible data collection involves several stages, including but not limited to determining use-case scenarios, selecting categories (annotations) such that the data are fit for the purpose of measuring algorithmic bias for subgroups and most importantly ensure that the selected categories/subcategories are robust to regional diversities and inclusive of as many subgroups as possible.

Device owners obtain these services and leave their device along with their access credentials at the mercy of technicians, which leads to privacy concerns for owners' personal data. We conduct a comprehensive four-part study to measure the state of privacy in the electronics repair industry. First, through a field study with 18 service providers, we uncover that most service providers do not have any privacy policy or controls to safeguard device owners' personal data from snooping by technicians. Second, we drop rigged devices for repair at 16 service providers and collect data on widespread privacy violations by technicians, including snooping on personal data, copying data off the device, and removing tracks of snooping activities. Third, we conduct an online survey (n=112) to collect data on customers' experiences when getting devices repaired. Fourth, we invite a subset of survey respondents (n=30) for semi-structured interviews to establish a deeper understanding of their experiences and identify potential solutions to curtail privacy violations by technicians. We apply our findings to discuss possible controls and actions different stakeholders and regulatory agencies should take to improve the state of privacy in the repair industry. ",

This work proposed a multi-stage deep reinforcement learning approach to estimate the PQ flexibility (PQ area) at the TSO-DSO interfaces and identifies the DER PQ setpoints for each operating point in a way, that DERs in the meshed HV grid can be coordinated to offer flexibility for the transmission grid. In the estimation process, we consider the steady-state grid limits and the robustness in the resulting voltage profile against uncertainties and the N-1 security criterion regarding thermal line loading, essential for real-life grid operational planning applications. Using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for PQ flexibility estimation is the first of its kind. Furthermore, our approach of considering N-1 security criterion for meshed grids and robustness against uncertainty directly in the optimization tasks offers a new perspective besides the common relaxation schema in finding a solution with mathematical optimal power flow (OPF). Finally, significant improvements in the computational efficiency in estimation PQ area are the highlights of the proposed method. ",

Based on state-of-the-art multiple instance learning architectures and two thyroid cancer data sets, an exhaustive study is conducted considering a range of common data augmentation strategies.

Data-driven reachable sets are employed for the controller design instead of using an explicit nonlinear system model. Although the process and measurement noise are bounded, the statistical properties of the noise are not required to be known. By using the past noisy input-output data in the learning phase, we propose a novel method to over-approximate reachable sets of an unknown nonlinear system. Then, we propose a data-driven predictive control approach to compute safe and robust control policies from noisy online data. The constraints are guaranteed in the control phase with robust safety margins through the effective use of the predicted output reachable set obtained in the learning phase. Finally, a numerical example validates the efficacy of the proposed approach and demonstrates comparable performance with a model-based predictive control approach. ",

    "abstract": "In a space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN), managing resources for the growing number of highly-dynamic and heterogeneous radios is a challenging task. Symbiotic communication (SC) is a novel paradigm, which leverages the analogy of the natural ecosystem in biology to create a radio ecosystem in wireless networks that achieves cooperative service exchange and resource sharing, i.e., service/resource trading, among numerous radios. As a result, the potential of symbiotic communication can be exploited to enhance resource management in SAGIN. Despite the fact that different radio resource bottlenecks can complement each other via symbiotic relationships, unreliable information sharing among heterogeneous radios and multi-dimensional resources managing under diverse service requests impose critical challenges on trusted trading and intelligent decision-making. In this article, we propose a secure and smart symbiotic SAGIN (S^4) framework by using blockchain for ensuring trusted trading among heterogeneous radios and machine learning (ML) for guiding complex service/resource trading. A case study demonstrates that our proposed S^4 framework provides better service with rational resource management when compared with existing schemes. Finally, we discuss several potential research directions for future symbiotic SAGIN. ",

Existing algorithms compute upper and lower bounds on the SSV for structured uncertainties that contain repeated (real or complex) scalars and/or non-repeated complex full blocks. This paper presents algorithms to compute bounds on the SSV for the case of repeated complex full blocks. This specific class of uncertainty is relevant for the input output analysis of many convective systems, such as fluid flows. Specifically, we present a power iteration to compute a lower bound on SSV for the case of repeated complex full blocks. This generalizes existing power iterations for repeated complex scalar and non-repeated complex full blocks. The upper bound can be formulated as a semi-definite program (SDP), which we solve using a standard interior-point method to compute optimal scaling matrices associated with the repeated full blocks. Our implementation of the method only requires gradient information, which improves the computational efficiency of the method. Finally, we test our proposed algorithms on an example model of incompressible fluid flow. The proposed methods provide less conservative bounds as compared to prior results, which ignore the repeated full block structure. ",

    "abstract": "In neural architecture search (NAS) methods based on latent space optimization (LSO), a deep generative model is trained to embed discrete neural architectures into a continuous latent space. In this case, different optimization algorithms that operate in the continuous space can be implemented to search neural architectures. However, the optimization of latent variables is challenging for gradient-based LSO since the mapping from the latent space to the architecture performance is generally non-convex. To tackle this problem, this paper develops a convexity regularized latent space optimization (CR-LSO) method, which aims to regularize the learning process of latent space in order to obtain a convex architecture performance mapping. Specifically, CR-LSO trains a graph variational autoencoder (G-VAE) to learn the continuous representations of discrete architectures. Simultaneously, the learning process of latent space is regularized by the guaranteed convexity of input convex neural networks (ICNNs). In this way, the G-VAE is forced to learn a convex mapping from the architecture representation to the architecture performance. Hereafter, the CR-LSO approximates the performance mapping using the ICNN and leverages the estimated gradient to optimize neural architecture representations. Experimental results on three popular NAS benchmarks show that CR-LSO achieves competitive evaluation results in terms of both computational complexity and architecture performance. ",

Despite considerable research efforts in recent years for English text, the task of ED in other languages has been significantly less explored. Switching to non-English languages, important research questions for ED include how well existing ED models perform on different languages, how challenging ED is in other languages, and how well ED knowledge and annotation can be transferred across languages. To answer those questions, it is crucial to obtain multilingual ED datasets that provide consistent event annotation for multiple languages. There exist some multilingual ED datasets; however, they tend to cover a handful of languages and mainly focus on popular ones. Many languages are not covered in existing multilingual ED datasets. In addition, the current datasets are often small and not accessible to the public. To overcome those shortcomings, we introduce a new large-scale multilingual dataset for ED (called MINION) that consistently annotates events for 8 different languages; 5 of them have not been supported by existing multilingual datasets. We also perform extensive experiments and analysis to demonstrate the challenges and transferability of ED across languages in MINION that in all call for more research effort in this area. ",

Two sub-networks, which are the sampling sub-network and the reconstruction sub-network, are included in the proposed framework.

In the reconstruction sub-network, a cascade network combining stacked denoising autoencoder (SDA) and convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to reconstruct signals. The SDA is used to solve the signal mapping problem and the signals are initially reconstructed. Furthermore, CNN is used to fully recover the structure and texture features of the image to obtain better reconstruction performance.

This contention leads to frequent packet drops at the NIC of receiving hosts, which triggers the congestion control mechanism of the network and eventually results in network performance degradation. To tackle this problem, we make a key observation that given the distributed storage service, the vast majority of data it receives from the network will be eventually written to high-speed storage media (e.g., SSD) by CPU. As such, we propose to bypass host memory when processing received data to completely circumvent this performance bottleneck. In particular, we design Lamda, a novel receiver cache processing system that consumes a small amount of CPU cache to process received data from the network at line rate. We implement a prototype of Lamda and evaluate its performance extensively in a Clos-based testbed. Results show that for distributed storage applications, Lamda improves network throughput by 4.7% with zero memory bandwidth consumption on storage nodes, and improves network throughput by up 17% and 45% for large block size and small size under the memory bandwidth pressure, respectively. Lamda can also be applied to latency-sensitive HPC applications, which reduces their communication latency by 35.1%. ",

    "abstract": "The spread of misinformation is a prominent problem in today's society, and many researchers in academia and industry are trying to combat it. Due to the vast amount of misinformation that is created every day, it is unrealistic to leave this task to human fact-checkers. Data scientists and researchers have been working on automated misinformation detection for years, and it is still a challenging problem today. The goal of our research is to add a new level to automated misinformation detection; classifying segments of text with persuasive writing techniques in order to produce interpretable reasoning for why an article can be marked as misinformation. To accomplish this, we present a novel annotation scheme containing many common persuasive writing tactics, along with a dataset with human annotations accordingly. For this task, we make use of a RoBERTa model for text classification, due to its high performance in NLP. We develop several language model-based baselines and present the results of our persuasive strategy label predictions as well as the improvements these intermediate labels make in detecting misinformation and producing interpretable results.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph technology is considered a powerful and semantically enabled solution to link entities, allowing users to derive new knowledge by reasoning data according to various types of reasoning rules. However, in building such a knowledge graph, events modeling, such as that of disasters, is often limited to single, isolated events. The linkages among cascading events are often missing in existing knowledge graphs. This paper introduces our GeoAI (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence) solutions to identify causality among events, in particular, disaster events, based on a set of spatially and temporally-enabled semantic rules. Through a use case of causal disaster events modeling, we demonstrated how these defined rules, including theme-based identification of correlated events, spatiotemporal co-occurrence constraint, and text mining of event metadata, enable the automatic extraction of causal relationships between different events. Our solution enriches the event knowledge base and allows for the exploration of linked cascading events in large knowledge graphs, therefore empowering knowledge query and discovery. ",

We optimize a contrastive learning objective based on the learned features from the encoder in both branches. Furthermore, we minimize the $L_1$ reconstruction loss according to the decoders' outputs.

However, above cascaded architecture can lead to large model size and inference delay, hindering them from mobile and real-time applications. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Progressive Motion Context Refine Network (PMCRNet) to predict motion fields and image context jointly for higher efficiency. Different from others that directly synthesize target frame from deep feature, we explore to simplify frame interpolation task by borrowing existing texture from adjacent input frames, which means that decoder in each pyramid level of our PMCRNet only needs to update easier intermediate optical flow, occlusion merge mask and image residual. Moreover, we introduce a new annealed multi-scale reconstruction loss to better guide the learning process of this efficient PMCRNet. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that proposed approaches not only achieve favorable quantitative and qualitative results but also reduces current model size and running time significantly. ",

    "abstract": "This paper studies efficient algorithms for dynamic curing policies and the corresponding network design problems to guarantee the fast extinction of epidemic spread in a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model. We consider a Markov process-based SIS epidemic model. We call a curing policy fair if demographic groups are cured with comparable speeds. We propose a fair curing policy based on the curing policy of Drakopoulos et al. Since these optimization problems are NP-hard, finding optimal policies is intractable for large graphs. We provide approximation guarantees on both curing and fair curing policies. Moreover, when the total infection rate is large, the original curing policy includes a waiting period in which no measures are taken to mitigate the spread until the rate slows down. To avoid the waiting period, we study network design problems to reduce the total infection rate by deleting edges or reducing the weight of edges. Then the curing processes become continuous since the total infection rate is restricted by network design. We provide algorithms with provable guarantees for the considered network design problems. In summary, the proposed fair curing and network design algorithms together provide an effective, fair, and computationally efficient approach that mitigates SIS epidemic spread in networks. ",

As deep learning has the outstanding ability to extract information from time series, its true capabilities on sparse, irregularly sampled, multivariate, and imbalanced physiological data are not yet fully explored. In this paper, we systematically examine the performance of machine learning models for the clinical prediction task based on the EHR, especially physiological time series. We choose Physionet 2019 challenge public dataset to predict Sepsis outcomes in ICU units. Ten baseline machine learning models are compared, including 3 deep learning methods and 7 non-deep learning methods, commonly used in the clinical prediction domain. Nine evaluation metrics with specific clinical implications are used to assess the performance of models. Besides, we sub-sample training dataset sizes and use learning curve fit to investigate the impact of the training dataset size on the performance of the machine learning models. We also propose the general pre-processing method for the physiology time-series data and use Dice Loss to deal with the dataset imbalanced problem. The results show that deep learning indeed outperforms non-deep learning, but with certain conditions: firstly, evaluating with some particular evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC, Sensitivity, and FNR), but not others; secondly, the training dataset size is large enough (with an estimation of a magnitude of thousands).

    "abstract": "Predicting the health risks of patients using Electronic Health Records (EHR) has attracted considerable attention in recent years, especially with the development of deep learning techniques. Health risk refers to the probability of the occurrence of a specific health outcome for a specific patient. The predicted risks can be used to support decision-making by healthcare professionals. EHRs are structured patient journey data. Each patient journey contains a chronological set of clinical events, and within each clinical event, there is a set of clinical/medical activities. Due to variations of patient conditions and treatment needs, EHR patient journey data has an inherently high degree of missingness that contains important information affecting relationships among variables, including time. Existing deep learning-based models generate imputed values for missing values when learning the relationships. However, imputed data in EHR patient journey data may distort the clinical meaning of the original EHR patient journey data, resulting in classification bias. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end approach to modeling EHR patient journey data with Integrated Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks. Our model can capture both long- and short-term temporal patterns within each patient journey and effectively handle the high degree of missingness in EHR data without any imputation data generation. Extensive experimental results using the proposed model on two real-world datasets demonstrate robust performance as well as superior prediction accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art imputation-based prediction methods.

However, motivated by the growing success of machine learning, current research focuses on replacing model-based data estimation methods by data-driven approaches, mainly neural networks (NNs). In this work, we particularly investigate the incorporation of existing model knowledge into data-driven approaches, which is expected to lead to complexity reduction and / or performance enhancement. We describe three different options, namely \"model-inspired'' pre-processing, choosing an NN architecture motivated by the properties of the underlying communication system, and inferring the layer structure of an NN with the help of model knowledge. Most of the current publications on NN-based data estimation deal with general multiple-input multiple-output communication (MIMO) systems. In this work, we investigate NN-based data estimation for so-called unique word orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (UW-OFDM) systems. We highlight differences between UW-OFDM systems and general MIMO systems one has to be aware of when using NNs for data estimation, and we introduce measures for successful utilization of NN-based data estimators in UW-OFDM systems. Further, we investigate the use of NNs for data estimation when channel coded data transmission is conducted, and we present adaptions to be made, such that NN-based data estimators provide satisfying performance for this case. We compare the presented NNs concerning achieved bit error ratio performance and computational complexity, we show the peculiar distributions of their data estimates, and we also point out their downsides compared to model-based equalizers.

Consequently, cache-based side-channel attacks on processes co-residing on the same core are becoming extremely difficult. Most of recent attacks then shift their focus to the last-level cache (LLC). Although cache partitioning is currently the most promising defense against the attacks abusing LLC, it is ineffective in thwarting the side-channel attacks that automatically create eviction sets or bypass the user address space layout randomization. In fact, these attacks are largely undefended in current computer systems. We propose Remapped Cache Layout (\\textsf{RCL}) -- a pure hardware defense against a broad range of conflict-based side-channel attacks. \\textsf{RCL} obfuscates the mapping from address to cache sets; therefore, an attacker cannot accurately infer the location of her data in caches or using a cache set to infer her victim's data. To our best knowledge, it is the first defense to thwart the aforementioned largely undefended side-channel attacks . \\textsf{RCL} has been implemented in a superscalar processor and detailed evaluation results show that \\textsf{RCL} incurs only small costs in area, frequency and execution time.

However, fake utterances are mostly generated by altering timbre, prosody, linguistic content or channel noise of original audios. They ignore a fake situation, in which the attacker manipulates an acoustic scene of the original audio with another forgery one. It will pose a major threat to our society if some people misuse the manipulated audio with malicious purpose. Therefore, this motivates us to fill in the gap. This paper designs such a dataset for scene fake audio detection (SceneFake). A manipulated audio in the SceneFake dataset involves only tampering the acoustic scene of an utterance by using speech enhancement technologies. We can not only detect fake utterances on a seen test set but also evaluate the generalization of fake detection models to unseen manipulation attacks. Some benchmark results are described on the SceneFake dataset. Besides, an analysis of fake attacks with different speech enhancement technologies and signal-to-noise ratios are presented on the dataset. The results show that scene manipulated utterances can not be detected reliably by the existing baseline models of ASVspoof 2019. Furthermore, the detection of unseen scene manipulation audio is still challenging. ",

In this paper, we investigate the network traffic data generated from a laser cutting machine deployed in a Trumpf factory in Germany. We analyze the traffic statistics, capture the dependencies between the internal states of the machine, and model the network traffic as a production state dependent stochastic process. The two-step model is proposed as follows: first, we model the production process as a multi-state semi-Markov process, then we learn the conditional distributions of the production state dependent packet interarrival time and packet size with generative models. We compare the performance of various generative models including variational autoencoder (VAE), conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), and generative adversarial network (GAN). The numerical results show a good approximation of the traffic arrival statistics depending on the production state. Among all generative models, CVAE provides in general the best performance in terms of the smallest Kullback-Leibler divergence. ",

Accordingly, with the maturity of thermal technology, RGB-T (RGB-Thermal) multi-modality tasks attain more and more attention. Thermal infrared images carry important information which can be used to improve the accuracy of SOD prediction. To accomplish it, the methods to integrate multi-modal information and suppress noises are critical. In this paper, we propose a novel network called Interactive Context-Aware Network (ICANet). It contains three modules that can effectively perform the cross-modal and cross-scale fusions. We design a Hybrid Feature Fusion (HFF) module to integrate the features of two modalities, which utilizes two types of feature extraction. The Multi-Scale Attention Reinforcement (MSAR) and Upper Fusion (UF) blocks are responsible for the cross-scale fusion that converges different levels of features and generate the prediction maps.

The proposed \"mean-IOU\" ST box maximizes the overlap with all the boxes belonging to the sample space with a class-specific approximated prior probability distribution of bounding boxes. Our method trains with both box- and point-labelled images in conjunction, unlike the existing methods, which train first with box- and then point-labelled images. In the most challenging setting, when only 5% images are box-labelled, quantitative experiments on a urine dataset show that our one-stage method outperforms two-stage methods by 5.56 mAP.

Different label assignment strategies have been designed to facilitate the consistency between the classification of foreground or background anchor points and the corresponding bounding box regressions. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed object detector can be further enhanced by employing a novel interactive transformer module.

Since IPHS models are consistent with the first and second principles of thermodynamics by design, so are the proposed Physically Consistent NODEs (PC-NODEs). Furthermore, the NODE training procedure allows us to seamlessly incorporate prior knowledge of the system properties in the learned dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by learning the thermodynamics of a building from the real-world measurements and the dynamics of a simulated gas-piston system.

The key challenge, however, concerns how to realize demand-awareness in RDCNs in a scalable fashion. This paper presents and evaluates Chopin, a hybrid scheduler for self-adjusting networks that provides demand-awareness at low overhead, by combining centralized and distributed approaches. Chopin allocates optical circuits to elephant flows, through its slower centralized scheduler, utilizing global information. Chopin's distributed scheduler is orders of magnitude faster and can swiftly react to changes in the traffic and adjust the optical circuits accordingly, by using only local information and running at each rack separately.

    "abstract": "Due to its importance in facial behaviour analysis, facial action unit (AU) detection has attracted increasing attention from the research community. Leveraging the online knowledge distillation framework, we propose the ``FANTrans\" method for AU detection. Our model consists of a hybrid network of convolution and transformer blocks to learn per-AU features and to model AU co-occurrences. The model uses a pre-trained face alignment network as the feature extractor. After further transformation by a small learnable add-on convolutional subnet, the per-AU features are fed into transformer blocks to enhance their representation. As multiple AUs often appear together, we propose a learnable attention drop mechanism in the transformer block to learn the correlation between the features for different AUs. We also design a classifier that predicts AU presence by considering all AUs' features, to explicitly capture label dependencies. Finally, we make the attempt of adapting online knowledge distillation in the training stage for this task, further improving the model's performance. Experiments on the BP4D and DISFA datasets demonstrating the effectiveness of proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "Malware programs are diverse, with varying objectives, functionalities, and threat levels ranging from mere pop-ups to financial losses. Consequently, their run-time footprints across the system differ, impacting the optimal data source (Network, Operating system (OS), Hardware) and features that are instrumental to malware detection. Further, the variations in threat levels of malware classes affect the user requirements for detection. Thus, the optimal tuple of <data-source, features, user-requirements> is different for each malware class, impacting the state-of-the-art detection solutions that are agnostic to these subtle differences. This paper presents SUNDEW, a framework to detect malware classes using their optimal tuple of <data-source, features, user-requirements>. SUNDEW uses an ensemble of specialized predictors, each trained with a particular data source (network, OS, and hardware) and tuned for features and requirements of a specific class. While the specialized ensemble with a holistic view across the system improves detection, aggregating the independent conflicting inferences from the different predictors is challenging. SUNDEW resolves such conflicts with a hierarchical aggregation considering the threat-level, noise in the data sources, and prior domain knowledge. We evaluate SUNDEW on a real-world dataset of over 10,000 malware samples from 8 classes. It achieves an F1-Score of one for most classes, with an average of 0.93 and a limited performance overhead of 1.5%. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI) detection, with the usage of elaborately designed features constructed from blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) time series. However, few works explored the feasibility of using BOLD signals directly as features. Meanwhile, existing GNN-based methods primarily rely on hand-crafted explicit brain topology as the adjacency matrix, which is not optimal and ignores the implicit topological organization of the brain. In this paper, we propose a spatial temporal graph convolutional network with a novel graph structure self-learning mechanism for EMCI detection. The proposed spatial temporal graph convolution block directly exploits BOLD time series as input features, which provides an interesting view for rsfMRI-based preclinical AD diagnosis. Moreover, our model can adaptively learn the optimal topological structure and refine edge weights with the graph structure self-learning mechanism. Results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Biomarkers consistent with previous studies can be extracted from the model, proving the reliable interpretability of our method. ",

While a bimodal text and layout approach performs best (F1=0.684), we show that text is the most important single predictor of entity relations. Additionally, layout geometry is highly predictive and may even be a feasible unimodal approach.

Many developers use online services, such as GitHub or GitLab, for collaborative software development.

Previous research and news articles have illustrated that developers are blameworthy of committing code secrets, such as private encryption keys, passwords, or API keys, accidentally to public source code repositories. However, making secrets publicly available might have disastrous consequences, such as leaving systems vulnerable to attacks. In a mixed-methods study, we surveyed 109 developers and conducted 14 in-depth semi-structured interviews with developers which experienced secret leakage in the past. We find that 30.3% of our participants have encountered secret leakage in the past, and that developers are facing several challenges with secret leakage prevention and remediation. Based on our findings, we discuss challenges, e. g., estimating risks of leaked secrets, and needs of developers in remediating and preventing code secret leaks, e. g., low adoption requirements.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are deep learning models designed to process attributed graphs. GNNs can compute cluster assignments accounting both for the vertex features and for the graph topology. Existing GNNs for clustering are trained by optimizing an unsupervised minimum cut objective, which is approximated by a Spectral Clustering (SC) relaxation. SC offers a closed-form solution that, however, is not particularly useful for a GNN trained with gradient descent. Additionally, the SC relaxation is loose and yields overly smooth cluster assignments, which do not separate well the samples. We propose a GNN model that optimizes a tighter relaxation of the minimum cut based on graph total variation (GTV). Our model has two core components: i) a message-passing layer that minimizes the $\\ell_1$ distance in the features of adjacent vertices, which is key to achieving sharp cluster transitions; ii) a loss function that minimizes the GTV in the cluster assignments while ensuring balanced partitions. By optimizing the proposed loss, our model can be self-trained to perform clustering. In addition, our clustering procedure can be used to implement graph pooling in deep GNN architectures for graph classification. Experiments show that our model outperforms other GNN-based approaches for clustering and graph pooling. ",

RC models use a nonlinear dynamic system, with fixed recurrent neural network named the \\textit{reservoir}, and learning process is restricted to adjusting a linear parametric function. %so the performance of learning is fast and precise. However, an RC model has several hyper-parameters, therefore EAs are helpful tools to figure out optimal RC architectures.

    "abstract": "Applications of Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) are promising for embedded systems with hard constraints on computing power. Contrary to conventional neural networks with the floating-point datatype, BNNs use binarized weights and activations which additionally reduces memory requirements. Memristors, emerging non-volatile memory devices, show great potential as the target implementation platform for BNNs by integrating storage and compute units. The energy and performance improvements are mainly due to 1) accelerating matrix-matrix multiplication as the main kernel for BNNs, 2) diminishing memory bottleneck in von-Neumann architectures, 3) and bringing massive parallelization. However, the efficiency of this hardware highly depends on how the network is mapped and executed on these devices. In this paper, we propose an efficient implementation of XNOR-based BNN to maximize parallelization while using a simple sensing scheme to generate activation values. Besides, a new mapping is introduced to minimize the overhead of data communication between convolution layers mapped to different memristor crossbars. This comes with extensive analytical and simulation-based analysis to evaluate the implication of different design choices considering the accuracy of the network. The results show that our approach achieves up to $10\\times$ energy-saving and $100\\times$ improvement in latency compared to the state-of-the-art in-memory hardware design. ",

While deep learning-based approaches can efficiently solve this problem, their computational requirements usually remain too large for high-resolution on-device image processing. To address this limitation, we propose a novel PyNET-V2 Mobile CNN architecture designed specifically for edge devices, being able to process RAW 12MP photos directly on mobile phones under 1.5 second and producing high perceptual photo quality. To train and to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution, we use the real-world Fujifilm UltraISP dataset consisting on thousands of RAW-RGB image pairs captured with a professional medium-format 102MP Fujifilm camera and a popular Sony mobile camera sensor. The results demonstrate that the PyNET-V2 Mobile model can substantially surpass the quality of tradition ISP pipelines, while outperforming the previously introduced neural network-based solutions designed for fast image processing. Furthermore, we show that the proposed architecture is also compatible with the latest mobile AI accelerators such as NPUs or APUs that can be used to further reduce the latency of the model to as little as 0.5 second.

    "abstract": "The mainstream workflow of image recognition applications is first training one global model on the cloud for a wide range of classes and then serving numerous clients, each with heterogeneous images from a small subset of classes to be recognized. From the cloud-client discrepancies on the range of image classes, the recognition model is desired to have strong adaptiveness, intuitively by concentrating the focus on each individual client's local dynamic class subset, while incurring negligible overhead. In this work, we propose to plug a new intra-client and inter-image attention (ICIIA) module into existing backbone recognition models, requiring only one-time cloud-based training to be client-adaptive. In particular, given a target image from a certain client, ICIIA introduces multi-head self-attention to retrieve relevant images from the client's historical unlabeled images, thereby calibrating the focus and the recognition result. Further considering that ICIIA's overhead is dominated by linear projection, we propose partitioned linear projection with feature shuffling for replacement and allow increasing the number of partitions to dramatically improve efficiency without scarifying too much accuracy. We finally evaluate ICIIA using 3 different recognition tasks with 9 backbone models over 5 representative datasets. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of ICIIA. Specifically, for ImageNet-1K with the backbone models of MobileNetV3-L and Swin-B, ICIIA can improve the testing accuracy to 83.37% (+8.11%) and 88.86% (+5.28%), while adding only 1.62% and 0.02% of FLOPs, respectively.

    "abstract": "Data Centers are huge power consumers, both because of the energy required for computation and the cooling needed to keep servers below thermal redlining. The most common technique to minimize cooling costs is increasing data room temperature. However, to avoid reliability issues, and to enhance energy efficiency, there is a need to predict the temperature attained by servers under variable cooling setups. Due to the complex thermal dynamics of data rooms, accurate runtime data center temperature prediction has remained as an important challenge. By using Gramatical Evolution techniques, this paper presents a methodology for the generation of temperature models for data centers and the runtime prediction of CPU and inlet temperature under variable cooling setups. As opposed to time costly Computational Fluid Dynamics techniques, our models do not need specific knowledge about the problem, can be used in arbitrary data centers, re-trained if conditions change and have negligible overhead during runtime prediction. Our models have been trained and tested by using traces from real Data Center scenarios. Our results show how we can fully predict the temperature of the servers in a data rooms, with prediction errors below 2 C and 0.5 C in CPU and server inlet temperature respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Community detection is the task of discovering groups of nodes sharing similar patterns within a network. With recent advancements in deep learning, methods utilizing graph representation learning and deep clustering have shown great results in community detection. However, these methods often rely on the topology of networks (i) ignoring important features such as network heterogeneity, temporality, multimodality, and other possibly relevant features. Besides, (ii) the number of communities is not known a priori and is often left to model selection. In addition, (iii) in multimodal networks all nodes are assumed to be symmetrical in their features; while true for homogeneous networks, most of the real-world networks are heterogeneous where feature availability often varies. In this paper, we propose a novel framework (named MGTCOM) that overcomes the above challenges (i)--(iii). MGTCOM identifies communities through multimodal feature learning by leveraging a new sampling technique for unsupervised learning of temporal embeddings. Importantly, MGTCOM is an end-to-end framework optimizing network embeddings, communities, and the number of communities in tandem. In order to assess its performance, we carried out an extensive evaluation on a number of multimodal networks. We found out that our method is competitive against state-of-the-art and performs well in inductive inference. ",

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in mathematics and network analysis is to find conditions under which a graph can be partitioned into smaller pieces. The most important tool for this partitioning is the Fiedler vector or discrete Cheeger inequality. These results relate the graph spectrum (eigenvalues of the normalized adjacency matrix) to the ability to break a graph into two pieces, with few edge deletions. An entire subfield of mathematics, called spectral graph theory, has emerged from these results. Yet these results do not say anything about the rich community structure exhibited by real-world networks, which typically have a significant fraction of edges contained in numerous densely clustered blocks. Inspired by the properties of real-world networks, we discover a new spectral condition that relates eigenvalue powers to a network decomposition into densely clustered blocks. We call this the \\emph{spectral triadic decomposition}. Our relationship exactly predicts the existence of community structure, as commonly seen in real networked data. Our proof provides an efficient algorithm to produce the spectral triadic decomposition. We observe on numerous social, coauthorship, and citation network datasets that these decompositions have significant correlation with semantically meaningful communities. ",

Upon such framework, common problems in oriented object detection such as boundary discontinuity and square-like problems are elegantly solved in a unified form.

In addition to competitive accuracy on challenging classical machine-learning benchmarks, our fermion quantum neural network performs machine learning on quantum systems with high precision and without preprocessing. The quantum nature also brings various other advantages, e.g., quantum correlations entitle networks with more general and local connectivity facilitating numerical simulations and experimental realizations, as well as novel perspectives to address the vanishing gradient problem long plaguing deep networks. We also demonstrate the applications of our quantum toolbox, such as quantum-entanglement analysis, for interpretable machine learning, including training dynamics, decision logic flow, and criteria formulation.

    "abstract": "Strong lensing in galaxy clusters probes properties of dense cores of dark matter halos in mass, studies the distant universe at flux levels and spatial resolutions otherwise unavailable, and constrains cosmological models independently. The next-generation large scale sky imaging surveys are expected to discover thousands of cluster-scale strong lenses, which would lead to unprecedented opportunities for applying cluster-scale strong lenses to solve astrophysical and cosmological problems. However, the large dataset challenges astronomers to identify and extract strong lensing signals, particularly strongly lensed arcs, because of their complexity and variety. Hence, we propose a framework to detect cluster-scale strongly lensed arcs, which contains a transformer-based detection algorithm and an image simulation algorithm. We embed prior information of strongly lensed arcs at cluster-scale into the training data through simulation and then train the detection algorithm with simulated images. We use the trained transformer to detect strongly lensed arcs from simulated and real data. Results show that our approach could achieve 99.63 % accuracy rate, 90.32 % recall rate, 85.37 % precision rate and 0.23 % false positive rate in detection of strongly lensed arcs from simulated images and could detect almost all strongly lensed arcs in real observation images. Besides, with an interpretation method, we have shown that our method could identify important information embedded in simulated data. Next step, to test the reliability and usability of our approach, we will apply it to available observations (e.g., DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys) and simulated data of upcoming large-scale sky surveys, such as the Euclid and the CSST.

However, the motivations of Bayesian inference which claim it to be the only 'rational' kind of reasoning do not apply in practice. They create a binary split in which all approximate inference is equally 'irrational'. Instead, we should ask ourselves how to define a spectrum of more- and less-rational reasoning that explains why we might prefer one Bayesian approximation to another. I explore approximate inference in Bayesian neural networks and consider the unintended interactions between the probabilistic model, approximating distribution, optimization algorithm, and dataset. The complexity of these interactions highlights the difficulty of any strategy for evaluating Bayesian approximations which focuses entirely on the method, outside the context of specific datasets and decision-problems. For given applications, the expected utility of the approximate posterior can measure inference quality. To assess a model's ability to incorporate different parts of the Bayesian framework we can identify desirable characteristic behaviours of Bayesian reasoning and pick decision-problems that make heavy use of those behaviours. Here, we use continual learning (testing the ability to update sequentially) and active learning (testing the ability to represent credence). But existing continual and active learning set-ups pose challenges that have nothing to do with posterior quality which can distort their ability to evaluate Bayesian approximations. These unrelated challenges can be removed or reduced, allowing better evaluation of approximate inference methods. ",

Oversampling subtypes with low prevalence features is not a satisfactory solution since it eventually leads to overfitting. We propose to create synthetic images with semantically-conditioned deep generative networks and to combine subtype-balanced synthetic images with the original dataset to achieve better segmentation performance. We show the suitability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and especially diffusion models to create realistic images based on subtype-conditioning for the use case of HER2-stained histopathology. Additionally, we show the capability of diffusion models to conditionally inpaint HER2 tumor areas with modified subtypes. Combining the original dataset with the same amount of diffusion-generated images increased the tumor Dice score from 0.833 to 0.854 and almost halved the variance between the HER2 subtype recalls. These results create the basis for more reliable automatic HER2 analysis with lower performance variance between individual HER2 subtypes. ",

    "abstract": "The selection of an optimal pacing site, which is ideally scar-free and late activated, is critical to the response of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Despite the success of current approaches formulating the detection of such late mechanical activation (LMA) regions as a problem of activation time regression, their accuracy remains unsatisfactory, particularly in cases where myocardial scar exists. To address this issue, this paper introduces a multi-task deep learning framework that simultaneously estimates LMA amount and classify the scar-free LMA regions based on cine displacement encoding with stimulated echoes (DENSE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). With a newly introduced auxiliary LMA region classification sub-network, our proposed model shows more robustness to the complex pattern cause by myocardial scar, significantly eliminates their negative effects in LMA detection, and in turn improves the performance of scar classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we tests our model on real cardiac MR images and compare the predicted LMA with the state-of-the-art approaches. It shows that our approach achieves substantially increased accuracy. In addition, we employ the gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM) to visualize the feature maps learned by all methods. Experimental results suggest that our proposed model better recognizes the LMA region pattern. ",

This paper presents a novel joint deep learning (JDL) framework that improves such tasks by utilizing simultaneously learned myocardium segmentations to eliminate negative effects from non-region-of-interest areas. In contrast to previous approaches treating scar detection and myocardium segmentation as separate or parallel tasks, our proposed method introduces a message passing module where the information of myocardium segmentation is directly passed to guide scar detectors. This newly designed network will efficiently exploit joint information from the two related tasks and use all available sources of myocardium segmentation to benefit scar identification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of JDL on LGE-CMR images for automated left ventricular (LV) scar detection, with great potential to improve risk prediction in patients with both ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease and to improve response rates to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for heart failure patients. Experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms multiple state-of-the-art methods, including commonly used two-step segmentation-classification networks, and multitask learning schemes where subtasks are indirectly interacted.
