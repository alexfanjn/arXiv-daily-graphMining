    "abstract": "Good decision making requires machine-learning models to provide trustworthy confidence scores. To this end, recent work has focused on miscalibration, i.e, the over or under confidence of model scores. Yet, contrary to widespread belief, calibration is not enough: even a classifier with the best possible accuracy and perfect calibration can have confidence scores far from the true posterior probabilities. This is due to the grouping loss, created by samples with the same confidence scores but different true posterior probabilities. Proper scoring rule theory shows that given the calibration loss, the missing piece to characterize individual errors is the grouping loss. While there are many estimators of the calibration loss, none exists for the grouping loss in standard settings. Here, we propose an estimator to approximate the grouping loss. We use it to study modern neural network architectures in vision and NLP. We find that the grouping loss varies markedly across architectures, and that it is a key model-comparison factor across the most accurate, calibrated, models. We also show that distribution shifts lead to high grouping loss. ",

    "abstract": "Semantic segmentation of hyperspectral images (HSI) has seen great strides in recent years by incorporating knowledge from deep learning RGB classification models. Similar to their classification counterparts, semantic segmentation models are vulnerable to adversarial examples and need adversarial training to counteract them. Traditional approaches to adversarial robustness focus on training or retraining a single network on attacked data, however, in the presence of multiple attacks these approaches decrease the performance compared to networks trained individually on each attack. To combat this issue we propose an Adversarial Discriminator Ensemble Network (ADE-Net) which focuses on attack type detection and adversarial robustness under a unified model to preserve per data-type weight optimally while robustifiying the overall network. In the proposed method, a discriminator network is used to separate data by attack type into their specific attack-expert ensemble network. Our approach allows for the presence of multiple attacks mixed together while also labeling attack types during testing. We experimentally show that ADE-Net outperforms the baseline, which is a single network adversarially trained under a mix of multiple attacks, for HSI Indian Pines, Kennedy Space, and Houston datasets.

    "abstract": "Big data applications offer smart solutions to many urgent societal challenges, such as health care, traffic coordination, energy management, etc. The basic premise for these applications is \"the more data the better\". The focus often lies on sensing infrastructures in the public realm that produce an ever-increasing amount of data. Yet, any smartphone and smartwatch owner could be a continuous source of valuable data and contribute to many useful big data applications. However, such data can reveal a lot of sensitive information, like the current location or the heart rate of the owner of such devices. Protection of personal data is important in our society and for example manifested in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, privacy protection and useful big data applications are hard to bring together, particularly in the human-centered IoT. Implementing proper privacy protection requires skills that are typically not in the focus of data analysts and big data developers. Thus, many individuals tend to share none of their data if in doubt whether it will be properly protected. There exist excellent privacy solutions between the \"all or nothing\" approach. For example, instead of continuously publishing the current location of individuals one might aggregate this data and only publish information of how many individuals are in a certain area of the city. Thus, personal data is not revealed, while useful information for certain applications like traffic coordination is retained. The goal of the Parrot project is to provide tools for real-time data analysis applications that leverage this \"middle ground\". Data analysts should only be required to specify their data needs, and end-users can select the privacy requirements for their data as well as the applications and end-users they want to share their data with.

Age-related and pathology-driven changes to brain structure are captured by various neuroimaging modalities. These datasets are characterized by high dimensionality as well as collinearity, hence applications of graph neural networks in neuroimaging research routinely use sample covariance matrices as graphs. We have recently studied covariance neural networks (VNNs) that operate on sample covariance matrices using the architecture derived from graph convolutional networks, and we showed VNNs enjoy significant advantages over traditional data analysis approaches. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of VNNs in inferring brain age using cortical thickness data. Furthermore, our results show that VNNs exhibit multi-scale and multi-site transferability for inferring {brain age}. In the context of brain age in Alzheimer's disease (AD), our experiments show that i) VNN outputs are interpretable as brain age predicted using VNNs is significantly elevated for AD with respect to healthy subjects for different datasets; and ii) VNNs can be transferable, i.e., VNNs trained on one dataset can be transferred to another dataset with different dimensions without retraining for brain age prediction.

Recently proposed black-box attacks can achieve a success rate of more than 95\\% after less than 1,000 queries. The question then arises of whether black-box attacks have become a real threat against IoT devices that rely on cloud APIs to achieve image classification. To shed some light on this, note that prior research has primarily focused on increasing the success rate and reducing the number of required queries. However, another crucial factor for black-box attacks against cloud APIs is the time required to perform the attack. This paper applies black-box attacks directly to cloud APIs rather than to local models, thereby avoiding multiple mistakes made in prior research. Further, we exploit load balancing to enable distributed black-box attacks that can reduce the attack time by a factor of about five for both local search and gradient estimation methods. ",

    "abstract": "Lifetime of motes in wireless sensor networks can be enlarged by decreasing the energy spent for communication. Approaches like time slotted channel hopping pursue this goal by performing frame exchanges according to a predefined schedule, which helps reducing the duty cycle. Unfortunately, whenever the receiving radio interface is active but nobody in the network is transmitting, idle listening occurs. If the traffic pattern is known in advance, as in the relevant case of periodic sensing, proactive reduction of idle listening (PRIL) noticeably lowers energy waste by disabling receivers when no frames are expected for them. Optimal PRIL operation demands that, at any time, the transmitter and receiver sides of a link have a coherent view of its state (either enabled or disabled). However, this is not ensured in the presence of acknowledgment frame losses. This paper presents and analyzes some strategies to cope with such events. An extensive experimental campaign has been carried out through discrete event simulation to determine what consequences above errors may have from both a functional and performance viewpoint. Results show that, although no strategy is optimal in all circumstances, different solutions can be profitably adopted depending on the specific operating conditions. ",

In this paper, communication over redundant links has been analyzed by means of a thorough experimental campaign, based on measurements carried out on real devices. Results confirm that, under typical operating conditions, the assumption of independence among channels in properly designed systems is verified reasonably well. Indeed, in our experiments, measured link quality indices did not differ more than 10% from what we expected from theory. This grants for redundant solutions tangible advantages over conventional Wi-Fi networks. ",

While high-fidelity models derived from first principles offer physical accuracy, they are too computationally expensive for use in real-time fire response. Low-fidelity models sacrifice some physical accuracy and generalizability via the integration of empirical measurements, but enable real-time simulations for operational use in fire response. Machine learning techniques offer the ability to bridge these objectives by learning first-principles physics while achieving computational speedup. While deep learning approaches have demonstrated the ability to predict wildfire propagation over large time periods, time-resolved fire-spread predictions are needed for active fire management. In this work, we evaluate the ability of deep learning approaches in accurately modeling the time-resolved dynamics of wildfires. We use an autoregressive process in which a convolutional recurrent deep learning model makes predictions that propagate a wildfire over 15 minute increments. We demonstrate the model in application to three simulated datasets of increasing complexity, containing both field fires with homogeneous fuel distribution as well as real-world topologies sampled from the California region of the United States. We show that even after 100 autoregressive predictions representing more than 24 hours of simulated fire spread, the resulting models generate stable and realistic propagation dynamics, achieving a Jaccard score between 0.89 and 0.94 when predicting the resulting fire scar.

Indeed, the development of deep learning techniques paved the way to build more complex and effective threat detection models. However, training those models may be computationally infeasible in most Edge or IoT devices. Current approaches rely on powerful centralized servers that receive data from all their parties -- violating basic privacy constraints and substantially affecting response times and operational costs due to the huge communication overheads. To mitigate these issues, Federated Learning emerged as a promising approach, where different agents collaboratively train a shared model, without exposing training data to others or requiring a compute-intensive centralized infrastructure. This work presents GowFed, a novel network threat detection system that combines the usage of Gower Dissimilarity matrices and Federated averaging. Different approaches of GowFed have been developed based on state-of the-art knowledge: (1) a vanilla version; and (2) a version instrumented with an attention mechanism. Furthermore, each variant has been tested using simulation oriented tools provided by TensorFlow Federated framework. In the same way, a centralized analogous development of the Federated systems is carried out to explore their differences in terms of scalability and performance -- across a set of designed experiments/scenarios. Overall, GowFed intends to be the first stepping stone towards the combined usage of Federated Learning and Gower Dissimilarity matrices to detect network threats in industrial-level networks. ",

In this paper, we propose to use this connection between audio and visual dynamics for solving two challenging tasks simultaneously, namely: (i) separating audio sources from a mixture using visual cues, and (ii) predicting the 3D visual motion of a sounding source using its separated audio. Towards this end, we present Audio Separator and Motion Predictor (ASMP) -- a deep learning framework that leverages the 3D structure of the scene and the motion of sound sources for better audio source separation. At the heart of ASMP is a 2.5D scene graph capturing various objects in the video and their pseudo-3D spatial proximities. This graph is constructed by registering together 2.5D monocular depth predictions from the 2D video frames and associating the 2.5D scene regions with the outputs of an object detector applied on those frames. The ASMP task is then mathematically modeled as the joint problem of: (i) recursively segmenting the 2.5D scene graph into several sub-graphs, each associated with a constituent sound in the input audio mixture (which is then separated) and (ii) predicting the 3D motions of the corresponding sound sources from the separated audio. To empirically evaluate ASMP, we present experiments on two challenging audio-visual datasets, viz. Audio Separation in the Wild (ASIW) and Audio Visual Event (AVE). Our results demonstrate that ASMP achieves a clear improvement in source separation quality, outperforming prior works on both datasets, while also estimating the direction of motion of the sound sources better than other methods.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of 3D vision, point cloud has become an increasingly popular 3D visual media content. Due to the irregular structure, point cloud has posed novel challenges to the related research, such as compression, transmission, rendering and quality assessment. In these latest researches, point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) has attracted wide attention due to its significant role in guiding practical applications, especially in many cases where the reference point cloud is unavailable. However, current no-reference metrics which based on prevalent deep neural network have apparent disadvantages. For example, to adapt to the irregular structure of point cloud, they require preprocessing such as voxelization and projection that introduce extra distortions, and the applied grid-kernel networks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, fail to extract effective distortion-related features. Besides, they rarely consider the various distortion patterns and the philosophy that PCQA should exhibit shifting, scaling, and rotational invariance. In this paper, we propose a novel no-reference PCQA metric named the Graph convolutional PCQA network (GPA-Net). To extract effective features for PCQA, we propose a new graph convolution kernel, i.e., GPAConv, which attentively captures the perturbation of structure and texture. Then, we propose the multi-task framework consisting of one main task (quality regression) and two auxiliary tasks (distortion type and degree predictions). Finally, we propose a coordinate normalization module to stabilize the results of GPAConv under shift, scale and rotation transformations. Experimental results on two independent databases show that GPA-Net achieves the best performance compared to the state-of-the-art no-reference PCQA metrics, even better than some full-reference metrics in some cases.

    "abstract": "Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which use a message-passing paradigm with stacked convolution layers, are foundational methods for learning graph representations. Recent GCN models use various residual connection techniques to alleviate the model degradation problem such as over-smoothing and gradient vanishing. Existing residual connection techniques, however, fail to make extensive use of underlying graph structure as in the graph spectral domain, which is critical for obtaining satisfactory results on heterophilic graphs. In this paper, we introduce ClenshawGCN, a GNN model that employs the Clenshaw Summation Algorithm to enhance the expressiveness of the GCN model. ClenshawGCN equips the standard GCN model with two straightforward residual modules: the adaptive initial residual connection and the negative second-order residual connection. We show that by adding these two residual modules, ClenshawGCN implicitly simulates a polynomial filter under the Chebyshev basis, giving it at least as much expressive power as polynomial spectral GNNs. In addition, we conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our model over spatial and spectral GNN models. ",

    "abstract": "Exploiting robots for activities in human-shared environments, whether warehouses, shopping centres or hospitals, calls for such robots to understand the underlying physical interactions between nearby agents and objects. In particular, modelling cause-and-effect relations between the latter can help to predict unobserved human behaviours and anticipate the outcome of specific robot interventions. In this paper, we propose an application of causal discovery methods to model human-robot spatial interactions, trying to understand human behaviours from real-world sensor data in two possible scenarios: humans interacting with the environment, and humans interacting with obstacles. New methods and practical solutions are discussed to exploit, for the first time, a state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithm in some challenging human environments, with potential application in many service robotics scenarios. To demonstrate the utility of the causal models obtained from real-world datasets, we present a comparison between causal and non-causal prediction approaches. Our results show that the causal model correctly captures the underlying interactions of the considered scenarios and improves its prediction accuracy. ",

Although the contrastive learning framework has shown its superiority on sentence representation learning over previous methods, the potential of such a framework is under-explored so far due to the simple method it used to construct positive pairs. Motivated by this, we propose a method that makes hard positives from the original training examples. A pivotal ingredient of our approach is the use of prefix that is attached to a pre-trained language model, which allows for differentiable data augmentation during contrastive learning. Our method can be summarized in two steps: supervised prefix-tuning followed by joint contrastive fine-tuning with unlabeled or labeled examples. Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of our data augmentation approach. The proposed method yields significant improvements over existing methods under both semi-supervised and supervised settings. Our experiments under a low labeled data setting also show that our method is more label-efficient than the state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods. ",

    "abstract": "Building automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems is a challenging task, especially for under-resourced languages that need to construct corpora nearly from scratch and lack sufficient training data. It has emerged that several African indigenous languages, including Kiswahili, are technologically under-resourced. ASR systems are crucial, particularly for the hearing-impaired persons who can benefit from having transcripts in their native languages. However, the absence of transcribed speech datasets has complicated efforts to develop ASR models for these indigenous languages. This paper explores the transcription process and the development of a Kiswahili speech corpus, which includes both read-out texts and spontaneous speech data from native Kiswahili speakers. The study also discusses the vowels and consonants in Kiswahili and provides an updated Kiswahili phoneme dictionary for the ASR model that was created using the CMU Sphinx speech recognition toolbox, an open-source speech recognition toolkit. The ASR model was trained using an extended phonetic set that yielded a WER and SER of 18.87% and 49.5%, respectively, an improved performance than previous similar research for under-resourced languages.

Speech based automatic AD screening systems provide a non-intrusive and more scalable alternative to other clinical screening techniques. Textual embedding features produced by pre-trained language models (PLMs) such as BERT are widely used in such systems. However, PLM domain fine-tuning is commonly based on the masked word or sentence prediction costs that are inconsistent with the back-end AD detection task. To this end, this paper investigates the use of prompt-based fine-tuning of PLMs that consistently uses AD classification errors as the training objective function. Disfluency features based on hesitation or pause filler token frequencies are further incorporated into prompt phrases during PLM fine-tuning. The exploit of the complementarity between BERT or RoBERTa based PLMs that are either prompt learning fine-tuned, or optimized using conventional masked word or sentence prediction costs, decision voting based system combination between them is further applied. Mean, standard deviation and the maximum among accuracy scores over 15 experiment runs are adopted as performance measurements for the AD detection system. Mean detection accuracy of 84.20% (with std 2.09%, best 87.5%) and 82.64% (with std 4.0%, best 89.58%) were obtained using manual and ASR speech transcripts respectively on the ADReSS20 test set consisting of 48 elderly speakers.

Recently, neural networks are widely applied to CSI compressed feedback since the original overhead is too large for the massive MIMO system. Notably, lightweight feedback networks attract special attention due to their practicality of deployment. However, the feedback accuracy is likely to be harmed by the network compression. In this paper, a cost free distillation technique named codeword mimic (CM) is proposed to train better feedback networks with the practical lightweight encoder. A mimic-explore training strategy with a special distillation scheduler is designed to enhance the CM learning. Experiments show that the proposed CM learning outperforms the previous state-of-the-art feedback distillation method, boosting the performance of the lightweight feedback network without any extra inference cost.

Conventional detectors tend to generate false alarms, while CNN-based detectors lose small targets in deep layers. To this end, we propose iSmallNet, a multi-stream densely nested network with label decoupling for infrared small object detection. On the one hand, to fully exploit the shape information of small targets, we decouple the original labeled ground-truth (GT) map into an interior map and a boundary one. The GT map, in collaboration with the two additional maps, tackles the unbalanced distribution of small object boundaries. On the other hand, two key modules are delicately designed and incorporated into the proposed network to boost the overall performance. First, to maintain small targets in deep layers, we develop a multi-scale nested interaction module to explore a wide range of context information. Second, we develop an interior-boundary fusion module to integrate multi-granularity information. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST and NUDT-SIRST clearly show the superiority of iSmallNet over 11 state-of-the-art detectors. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in monocular 3D detection leverage a depth estimation network explicitly as an intermediate stage of the 3D detection network. Depth map approaches yield more accurate depth to objects than other methods thanks to the depth estimation network trained on a large-scale dataset. However, depth map approaches can be limited by the accuracy of the depth map, and sequentially using two separated networks for depth estimation and 3D detection significantly increases computation cost and inference time. In this work, we propose a method to boost the RGB image-based 3D detector by jointly training the detection network with a depth prediction loss analogous to the depth estimation task. In this way, our 3D detection network can be supervised by more depth supervision from raw LiDAR points, which does not require any human annotation cost, to estimate accurate depth without explicitly predicting the depth map. Our novel object-centric depth prediction loss focuses on depth around foreground objects, which is important for 3D object detection, to leverage pixel-wise depth supervision in an object-centric manner. Our depth regression model is further trained to predict the uncertainty of depth to represent the 3D confidence of objects. To effectively train the 3D detector with raw LiDAR points and to enable end-to-end training, we revisit the regression target of 3D objects and design a network architecture. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks show that our method can significantly boost the monocular image-based 3D detector to outperform depth map approaches while maintaining the real-time inference speed.

This limits the expressivity of videos to only image-based operations on the individual video frames needing network designs to obtain temporally coherent trajectories in the underlying image space. We propose INR-V, a video representation network that learns a continuous space for video-based generative tasks. INR-V parameterizes videos using implicit neural representations (INRs), a multi-layered perceptron that predicts an RGB value for each input pixel location of the video. The INR is predicted using a meta-network which is a hypernetwork trained on neural representations of multiple video instances. Later, the meta-network can be sampled to generate diverse novel videos enabling many downstream video-based generative tasks. Interestingly, we find that conditional regularization and progressive weight initialization play a crucial role in obtaining INR-V. The representation space learned by INR-V is more expressive than an image space showcasing many interesting properties not possible with the existing works. For instance, INR-V can smoothly interpolate intermediate videos between known video instances (such as intermediate identities, expressions, and poses in face videos). It can also in-paint missing portions in videos to recover temporally coherent full videos. In this work, we evaluate the space learned by INR-V on diverse generative tasks such as video interpolation, novel video generation, video inversion, and video inpainting against the existing baselines. INR-V significantly outperforms the baselines on several of these demonstrated tasks, clearly showcasing the potential of the proposed representation space. ",

The main component of both is the pattern matching facility, which is shared by the two standards. In many aspects, it goes well beyond RPQs, CRPQs, and similar queries on which the research community has focused for years. Our main contribution is to distill the lengthy standard specification into a simple Graph Pattern Calculus (GPC) that reflects all the key pattern matching features of GQL and SQL/PGQ, and at the same time lends itself to rigorous theoretical investigation. We describe the syntax and semantics of GPC, along with the typing rules that ensure its expressions are well-defined, and state some basic properties of the language.

In this work we construct an NTU-centric social heterogeneous network to co-embed NTUs. We then principally integrate these NTU embeddings into a large pretrained language model by fine-tuning with these additional units. This adds context to noisy short-text social media. Experiments show that utilizing NTU-augmented text representations significantly outperforms existing text-only baselines by 2-5\\% relative points on many downstream tasks highlighting the importance of context to social media NLP. We also highlight that including NTU context into the initial layers of language model alongside text is better than using it after the text embedding is generated.

When the model is trained with a large corpus of instrumental classical music and popular melodies rendered as mel spectrograms, it exhibits greater prediction errors for random pitch sequences that are rated less musical by human subjects. We found that the prediction error depends on the amount of information regarding the subsequent note, the pitch interval, and the temporal context. Our findings suggest that predictability is correlated with human perception of musicality and that a predictive coding neural network trained on music can be used to characterize the features and motifs contributing to human perception of music.

    "abstract": "Training deep neural networks for classification often includes minimizing the training loss beyond the zero training error point. In this phase of training, a \"neural collapse\" behavior has been observed: the variability of features (outputs of the penultimate layer) of within-class samples decreases and the mean features of different classes approach a certain tight frame structure. Recent works analyze this behavior via idealized unconstrained features models where all the minimizers exhibit exact collapse. However, with practical networks and datasets, the features typically do not reach exact collapse, e.g., because deep layers cannot arbitrarily modify intermediate features that are far from being collapsed. In this paper, we propose a richer model that can capture this phenomenon by forcing the features to stay in the vicinity of a predefined features matrix (e.g., intermediate features). We explore the model in the small vicinity case via perturbation analysis and establish results that cannot be obtained by the previously studied models. For example, we prove reduction in the within-class variability of the optimized features compared to the predefined input features (via analyzing gradient flow on the \"central-path\" with minimal assumptions), analyze the minimizers in the near-collapse regime, and provide insights on the effect of regularization hyperparameters on the closeness to collapse. We support our theory with experiments in practical deep learning settings. ",

    "title": "Robust Distributed Learning Against Both Distributional Shifts and  Byzantine Attacks",
    "abstract": "In distributed learning systems, robustness issues may arise from two sources. On one hand, due to distributional shifts between training data and test data, the trained model could exhibit poor out-of-sample performance. On the other hand, a portion of working nodes might be subject to byzantine attacks which could invalidate the learning result. Existing works mostly deal with these two issues separately. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that equips distributed learning with robustness measures against both distributional shifts and byzantine attacks. Our algorithm is built on recent advances in distributionally robust optimization as well as norm-based screening (NBS), a robust aggregation scheme against byzantine attacks. We provide convergence proofs in three cases of the learning model being nonconvex, convex, and strongly convex for the proposed algorithm, shedding light on its convergence behaviors and endurability against byzantine attacks. In particular, we deduce that any algorithm employing NBS (including ours) cannot converge when the percentage of byzantine nodes is 1/3 or higher, instead of 1/2, which is the common belief in current literature. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm against both robustness issues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address distributional shifts and byzantine attacks simultaneously. ",

    "abstract": "As we are more and more dependent on the communication technologies, resilience against any attacks on communication networks is important to guarantee the digital sovereignty of our society. New developments of communication networks tackle the problem of resilience by in-network computing approaches for higher protocol layers, while the physical layer remains an open problem. This is particularly true for wireless communication systems which are inherently vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to the open nature of the wireless medium. In denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, an active adversary is able to completely disrupt the communication and it has been shown that Turing machines are incapable of detecting such attacks. As Turing machines provide the fundamental limits of digital information processing and therewith of digital twins, this implies that even the most powerful digital twins that preserve all information of the physical network error-free are not capable of detecting such attacks. This stimulates the question of how powerful the information processing hardware must be to enable the detection of DoS attacks. Therefore, in the paper the need of neuromorphic twins is advocated and by the use of Blum-Shub-Smale machines a first implementation that enables the detection of DoS attacks is shown. This result holds for both cases of with and without constraints on the input and jamming sequences of the adversary. ",

While several test-time adaptation techniques have emerged, they typically rely on synthetic data augmentations in cases of limited target data availability. In this paper, we consider the challenging setting of single-shot adaptation and explore the design of augmentation strategies. We argue that augmentations utilized by existing methods are insufficient to handle large distribution shifts, and hence propose a new approach SiSTA (Single-Shot Target Augmentations), which first fine-tunes a generative model from the source domain using a single-shot target, and then employs novel sampling strategies for curating synthetic target data. Using experiments with a state-of-the-art domain adaptation method, we find that SiSTA produces improvements as high as 20\\% over existing baselines under challenging shifts in face attribute detection, and that it performs competitively to oracle models obtained by training on a larger target dataset.

    "abstract": "To find consistent initial data points for a system of differential-algebraic equations, requires the identification of its missing constraints. An efficient class of structural methods exploiting a dependency graph for this task was initiated by Pantiledes. More complete methods rely on differential-algebraic geometry but suffer from other issues (e.g. high complexity). In this paper we give a new class of efficient structural methods combined with new tools from numerical real algebraic geometry that has much improved completeness properties. Existing structural methods may fail for a system of differential-algebraic equations if its Jacobian matrix after differentiation is still singular due to symbolic cancellation or numerical degeneration. Existing structural methods can only handle degenerated cases caused by symbolic cancellation. However, if a system has parameters, then its parametric Jacobian matrix may be still singular after application of the structural method for certain values of the parameters. This case is called numerical degeneration. For polynomially nonlinear systems of differential-algebraic equations, numerical methods are given to solve both degenerated cases using numerical real algebraic geometry. First, we introduce a witness point method, which produces at least one witness point on every constraint component. This can help to ensure constant rank and detection of degeneration on all components of such systems. Secondly, we present a Constant Rank Embedding Lemma, and based on it propose an Index Reduction by Embedding (IRE) method which can construct an equivalent system with a full rank Jacobian matrix. Thirdly, IRE leads to a global structural differentiation method, to solve degenerated differential-algebraic equations on all components numerically. Application examples from circuits, mechanics, are used to demonstrate our method. ",

Compared with the existing CNN-based methods, our method adopts the MLP-Mixer structure, which is more in line with the structure of the packet than the conventional convolution operation. In our method, the packet is divided into the packet header and the packet body, together with the flow features of the packet as input from different views. We utilize a multi-label setting to learn different scenarios simultaneously to improve the classification performance by exploiting the correlations between different scenarios. Taking advantage of the above characteristics, we propose an end-to-end network traffic classification method.

We apply exemplar learning to dynamically boost gene expression prediction from nearest/similar exemplars of a given tissue slide image window. Our EGN framework composes of three main components: 1) an extractor to structure a representation space for unsupervised exemplar retrievals; 2) a vision transformer (ViT) backbone to progressively extract representations of the input window; and 3) an Exemplar Bridging (EB) block to adaptively revise the intermediate ViT representations by using the nearest exemplars. Finally, we complete the gene expression prediction task with a simple attention-based prediction block.

In traditional application scenarios, FSs are mainly applied to model Euclidean space data and cannot be used to handle graph data of non-Euclidean structure in nature, such as social networks and traffic route maps. Therefore, development of FS modeling method that is suitable for graph data and can retain the advantages of traditional FSs is an important research. To meet this challenge, a new type of FS for graph data modeling called Graph Fuzzy System (GFS) is proposed in this paper, where the concepts, modeling framework and construction algorithms are systematically developed. First, GFS related concepts, including graph fuzzy rule base, graph fuzzy sets and graph consequent processing unit (GCPU), are defined. A GFS modeling framework is then constructed and the antecedents and consequents of the GFS are presented and analyzed. Finally, a learning framework of GFS is proposed, in which a kernel K-prototype graph clustering (K2PGC) is proposed to develop the construction algorithm for the GFS antecedent generation, and then based on graph neural network (GNNs), consequent parameters learning algorithm is proposed for GFS. Specifically, three different versions of the GFS implementation algorithm are developed for comprehensive evaluations with experiments on various benchmark graph classification datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed GFS inherits the advantages of both existing mainstream GNNs methods and conventional FSs methods while achieving better performance than the counterparts.

For long document evaluation metrics, human evaluation results show that ROUGE remains the best at evaluating the relevancy of a summary. It also reveals important limitations of factuality metrics in detecting different types of factual errors and the reasons behind the effectiveness of BARTScore. We then suggest promising directions in the endeavor of developing factual consistency metrics.

To address this issue, we propose to use neural architecture search (NAS) to design data-specific message passing architecture for TKG completion. In particular, we develop a generalized framework to explore topological and temporal information in TKGs. Based on this framework, we design an expressive search space to fully capture various properties of different TKGs. Meanwhile, we adopt a search algorithm, which trains a supernet structure by sampling single path for efficient search with less cost. We further conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. The results show that the searched architectures by our method achieve the SOTA performances.

It has been theoretically and empirically shown that there exist conflicts and inconsistencies among accuracy and multiple fairness measures. Optimising one or several fairness measures may sacrifice or deteriorate other measures. Two key questions should be considered, how to simultaneously optimise accuracy and multiple fairness measures, and how to optimise all the considered fairness measures more effectively. In this paper, we view the mitigating unfairness problem as a multi-objective learning problem considering the conflicts among fairness measures. A multi-objective evolutionary learning framework is used to simultaneously optimise several metrics (including accuracy and multiple fairness measures) of machine learning models. Then, ensembles are constructed based on the learning models in order to automatically balance different metrics. Empirical results on eight well-known datasets demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for mitigating unfairness, our proposed algorithm can provide decision-makers with better tradeoffs among accuracy and multiple fairness metrics. Furthermore, the high-quality models generated by the framework can be used to construct an ensemble to automatically achieve a better tradeoff among all the considered fairness metrics than other ensemble methods.

The question is whether we are able to perform a speech-text joint pre-training on unpaired speech and text. In this paper, we take the idea of self-supervised pre-training one step further and propose token2vec, a novel joint pre-training framework for unpaired speech and text based on discrete representations of speech. Firstly, due to the distinct characteristics between speech and text modalities, where speech is continuous while text is discrete, we first discretize speech into a sequence of discrete speech tokens to solve the modality mismatch problem. Secondly, to solve the length mismatch problem, where the speech sequence is usually much longer than text sequence, we convert the words of text into phoneme sequences and randomly repeat each phoneme in the sequences. Finally, we feed the discrete speech and text tokens into a modality-agnostic Transformer encoder and pre-train with token-level masking language modeling (tMLM). Experiments show that token2vec is significantly superior to various speech-only pre-training baselines, with up to 17.7% relative WER reduction. Token2vec model is also validated on a non-ASR task, i.e., spoken intent classification, and shows good transferability. ",

Decision mining in process mining aims to describe/predict the routing of a process instance at a decision point of the process. By predicting the decision, one can take proactive actions to improve the process. For instance, when a bottleneck is developing in one of the possible decisions, one can predict the decision and bypass the bottleneck. However, despite its huge potential for such operational support, existing techniques for decision mining have focused largely on describing decisions but not on predicting them, deploying decision trees to produce logical expressions to explain the decision. In this work, we aim to enhance the predictive capability of decision mining to enable proactive operational support by deploying more advanced machine learning algorithms. Our proposed approach provides explanations of the predicted decisions using SHAP values to support the elicitation of proactive actions. We have implemented a Web application to support the proposed approach and evaluated the approach using the implementation. ",

    "abstract": "The key to traffic prediction is to accurately depict the temporal dynamics of traffic flow traveling in a road network, so it is important to model the spatial dependence of the road network. The essence of spatial dependence is to accurately describe how traffic information transmission is affected by other nodes in the road network, and the GNN-based traffic prediction model, as a benchmark for traffic prediction, has become the most common method for the ability to model spatial dependence by transmitting traffic information with the message passing mechanism. However, existing methods model a local and static spatial dependence, which cannot transmit the global-dynamic traffic information (GDTi) required for long-term prediction. The challenge is the difficulty of detecting the precise transmission of GDTi due to the uncertainty of individual transport, especially for long-term transmission. In this paper, we propose a new hypothesis\\: GDTi behaves macroscopically as a transmitting causal relationship (TCR) underlying traffic flow, which remains stable under dynamic changing traffic flow. We further propose spatial-temporal Granger causality (STGC) to express TCR, which models global and dynamic spatial dependence. To model global transmission, we model the causal order and causal lag of TCRs global transmission by a spatial-temporal alignment algorithm. To capture dynamic spatial dependence, we approximate the stable TCR underlying dynamic traffic flow by a Granger causality test. The experimental results on three backbone models show that using STGC to model the spatial dependence has better results than the original model for 45 min and 1 h long-term prediction. ",

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle-aided communication (UAB-BS) is a promising solution to establish rapid wireless connectivity in sudden/temporary crowded events because of its more flexibility and mobility features than conventional ground base station (GBS). Because of these benefits, UAV-BSs can easily be deployed at high altitudes to provide more line of sight (LoS) links than GBS. Therefore, users on the ground can obtain more reliable wireless channels. In practice, the mobile nature of the ground user can create uneven user density at different times and spaces. This phenomenon leads to unbalanced user associations among UAV-BSs and may cause frequent UAV-BS overload. We propose a three-dimensional adaptive and fair deployment approach to solve this problem. The proposed approach can jointly optimize the altitude and transmission power of UAV-BS to offload the traffic from overloaded UAV-BSs. The simulation results show that the network performance improves by 37.71% in total capacity, 37.48% in total energy efficiency and 16.12% in the Jain fairness index compared to the straightforward greedy approach.

Despite the use of large-scale unlabeled data, the performance of unsupervised methods typically lags far behind that of the supervised counterparts in most downstream tasks.

Our method include three parts: 1) Generate: A generator/discriminator model is jointly trained to synthesize sentence pairs from open-domain unlabeled corpus; 2) Discriminate: Noisy sentence pairs are filtered out by the discriminator to acquire high-quality positive and negative sentence pairs; 3) Contrast: A prompt-based contrastive approach is presented for sentence representation learning with both annotated and synthesized data. Comprehensive experiments show that GenSE achieves an average correlation score of 85.19 on the STS datasets and consistent performance improvement on four domain adaptation tasks, significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art methods and convincingly corroborating its effectiveness and generalization ability.Code, Synthetic data and Models available at https://github.com/MatthewCYM/GenSE.

Among the various CAD formats, we consider the widely used STEP extension, which represents a standard for product manufacturing information. This particular format represents a 3D model as a set of primitive elements such as surfaces and vertices linked together. In our approach, we exploit the linked structure of STEP files to create a graph in which the nodes are the primitive elements and the arcs are the connections between them. We then use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to solve the problem of model classification. Finally, we created two datasets of 3D models in native CAD format, respectively, by collecting data from the Traceparts model library and from the Configurators software modeling company. We used these datasets to test and compare our approach with respect to state-of-the-art methods that consider other 3D formats.

However, current continuous authentication methods suffer some limitations: 1) behavioral biometrics from impostors are needed to train continuous authentication models. Since the distribution of negative samples from diverse attackers are unknown, it is a difficult problem to solve in real-world scenarios; 2) most deep learning-based continuous authentication methods need to train two models to improve authentication performance. A deep learning model for deep feature extraction, and a machine learning-based classifier for classification; 3) weak capability of capturing users' behavioral patterns leads to poor authentication performance. To solve these issues, we propose a relative attention-based one-class adversarial autoencoder for continuous authentication of smartphone users. First, we propose a one-class adversarial autoencoder to learn latent representations of legitimate users' behavioral patterns, which is trained only with legitimate smartphone users' behavioral biometrics. Second, we present the relative attention layer to capture richer contextual semantic representation of users' behavioral patterns, which modifies the standard self-attention mechanism using convolution projection instead of linear projection to perform the attention maps. Experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve superior performance of 1.05% EER, 1.09% EER, and 1.08% EER with a high authentication frequency (0.7s) on three public datasets. ",

    "abstract": "The deep CNNs in image semantic segmentation typically require a large number of densely-annotated images for training and have difficulties in generalizing to unseen object categories. Therefore, few-shot segmentation has been developed to perform segmentation with just a few annotated examples. In this work, we tackle the few-shot segmentation using a self-regularized prototypical network (SRPNet) based on prototype extraction for better utilization of the support information. The proposed SRPNet extracts class-specific prototype representations from support images and generates segmentation masks for query images by a distance metric - the fidelity. A direct yet effective prototype regularization on support set is proposed in SRPNet, in which the generated prototypes are evaluated and regularized on the support set itself. The extent to which the generated prototypes restore the support mask imposes an upper limit on performance. The performance on the query set should never exceed the upper limit no matter how complete the knowledge is generalized from support set to query set. With the specific prototype regularization, SRPNet fully exploits knowledge from the support and offers high-quality prototypes that are representative for each semantic class and meanwhile discriminative for different classes. The query performance is further improved by an iterative query inference (IQI) module that combines a set of regularized prototypes. Our proposed SRPNet achieves new state-of-art performance on 1-shot and 5-shot segmentation benchmarks. ",

In Linguistic terms, they are steps to achieve an operation, often through the usage of action verbs. For example, the sentence, `Get your homework finished by tomorrow` qualifies as actionable since it demands a specific action (In this case, finishing homework) to be taken. In contrast, a simple sentence such as, `I like to play the guitar` does not qualify as an actionable phrase since it simply states a personal choice of the person instead of demanding a task to be finished. In this paper, the aim is to explore if Actionables can be extracted from raw text using Linguistic filters designed from scratch. These filters are specially catered to identifying actionable text using Transfer Learning as the lead role. Actionable Detection can be used in detecting emergency tasks during a crisis, Instruction accuracy for First aid and can also be used to make productivity tools like automatic ToDo list generators from conferences. To accomplish this, we use the Enron Email Dataset and apply our Linguistic filters on the cleaned textual data. We then use Transfer Learning with the Universal Sentence Encoder to train a model to classify whether a given string of raw text is actionable or not. ",

By solving this model in the dual limit of large training set size and large number of parameters, we gain insight into (i) the statistical structure of datasets and tasks that lead to scaling laws, (ii) the way nonlinear feature maps, such as those provided by neural networks, enable scaling laws when trained on these datasets, (iii) the optimality of the equiparameterization scaling of training sets and parameters, and (iv) whether such scaling laws can break down and how they behave when they do. Key findings are the manner in which the power laws that occur in the statistics of natural datasets are extended by nonlinear random feature maps and then translated into power-law scalings of the test loss and how the finite extent of the data's spectral power law causes the model's performance to plateau.

Recently, a large number of criminal behaviors continuously emerge on blockchain, such as Ponzi schemes and phishing scams, which severely endanger decentralized finance. Existing graph-based abnormal behavior detection methods on blockchain usually focus on constructing homogeneous transaction graphs without distinguishing the heterogeneity of nodes and edges, resulting in partial loss of transaction pattern information. Although existing heterogeneous modeling methods can depict richer information through metapaths, the extracted metapaths generally neglect temporal dependencies between entities and do not reflect real behavior. In this paper, we introduce Time-aware Metapath Feature Augmentation (TMFAug) as a plug-and-play module to capture the real metapath-based transaction patterns during Ponzi scheme detection on Ethereum. The proposed module can be adaptively combined with existing graph-based Ponzi detection methods. Extensive experimental results show that our TMFAug can help existing Ponzi detection methods achieve significant performance improvements on the Ethereum dataset, indicating the effectiveness of heterogeneous temporal information for Ponzi scheme detection.

Current supervised object detection algorithms require datasets that contain annotated examples of every to-be-detected object. While a large and expensive dataset could be developed to include common FOD examples, it is infeasible to collect all possible FOD examples in the dataset representation because of the open-ended nature of FOD. Limitations of the dataset could cause FOD detection systems driven by those supervised algorithms to miss certain FOD, which can become dangerous to airport operations. To this end, this paper presents a self-supervised FOD localization by learning to predict the runway images, which avoids the enumeration of FOD annotation examples. The localization method utilizes the Vision Transformer (ViT) to improve localization performance. The experiments show that the method successfully detects arbitrary FOD in real-world runway situations. The paper also provides an extension to the localization result to perform classification; a feature that can be useful to downstream tasks. To train the localization, this paper also presents a simple and realistic dataset creation framework that only collects clean runway images. The training and testing data for this method are collected at a local airport using unmanned aircraft systems (UAS). Additionally, the developed dataset is provided for public use and further studies. ",

Third, we online learn the policy in real networks with a novel online algorithm with safe exploration and Gaussian process regression.

Moreover, task labels are often scarce, costly to obtain, and highly imbalanced for large dynamic graphs. Recent advances in self-supervised learning on graphs demonstrate great potential, but focus on static graphs. State-of-the-art (SoTA) models for dynamic graphs are not only incompatible with the self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm but also fail to forecast interactions beyond the very near future. To address these limitations, we present DyG2Vec, an SSL-compatible, efficient model for representation learning on dynamic graphs. DyG2Vec uses a window-based mechanism to generate task-agnostic node embeddings that can be used to forecast future interactions. DyG2Vec significantly outperforms SoTA baselines on benchmark datasets for downstream tasks while only requiring a fraction of the training/inference time.

    "abstract": "This paper describes the transformation of a traditional in-silico classification network into an optical fully convolutional neural network with high-resolution feature maps and kernels. When using the free-space 4f system to accelerate the inference speed of neural networks, higher resolutions of feature maps and kernels can be used without the loss in frame rate. We present FatNet for the classification of images, which is more compatible with free-space acceleration than standard convolutional classifiers. It neglects the standard combination of convolutional feature extraction and classifier dense layers by performing both in one fully convolutional network. This approach takes full advantage of the parallelism in the 4f free-space system and performs fewer conversions between electronics and optics by reducing the number of channels and increasing the resolution, making the network faster in optics than off-the-shelf networks. To demonstrate the capabilities of FatNet, it trained with the CIFAR100 dataset on GPU and the simulator of the 4f system, then compared the results against ResNet-18. The results show 8.2 times fewer convolution operations at the cost of only 6% lower accuracy compared to the original network. These are promising results for the approach of training deep learning with high-resolution kernels in the direction towards the upcoming optics era. ",

    "title": "Imitating Opponent to Win: Adversarial Policy Imitation Learning in  Two-player Competitive Games",
    "abstract": "Recent research on vulnerabilities of deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown that adversarial policies adopted by an adversary agent can influence a target RL agent (victim agent) to perform poorly in a multi-agent environment. In existing studies, adversarial policies are directly trained based on experiences of interacting with the victim agent. There is a key shortcoming of this approach; knowledge derived from historical interactions may not be properly generalized to unexplored policy regions of the victim agent, making the trained adversarial policy significantly less effective. In this work, we design a new effective adversarial policy learning algorithm that overcomes this shortcoming. The core idea of our new algorithm is to create a new imitator to imitate the victim agent's policy while the adversarial policy will be trained not only based on interactions with the victim agent but also based on feedback from the imitator to forecast victim's intention. By doing so, we can leverage the capability of imitation learning in well capturing underlying characteristics of the victim policy only based on sample trajectories of the victim. Our victim imitation learning model differs from prior models as the environment's dynamics are driven by adversary's policy and will keep changing during the adversarial policy training. We provide a provable bound to guarantee a desired imitating policy when the adversary's policy becomes stable. We further strengthen our adversarial policy learning by making our imitator a stronger version of the victim. Finally, our extensive experiments using four competitive MuJoCo game environments show that our proposed adversarial policy learning algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. ",

While automatic modelling of pedestrian attention holds great promise to improve simulations of pedestrian behavior, current saliency prediction approaches mostly focus on generic free-viewing scenarios and do not reflect the specific challenges present in pedestrian attention prediction. In this paper, we present Context-SalNET, a novel encoder-decoder architecture that explicitly addresses three key challenges of visual attention prediction in pedestrians: First, Context-SalNET explicitly models the context factors urgency and safety preference in the latent space of the encoder-decoder model. Second, we propose the exponentially weighted mean squared error loss (ew-MSE) that is able to better cope with the fact that only a small part of the ground truth saliency maps consist of non-zero entries. Third, we explicitly model epistemic uncertainty to account for the fact that training data for pedestrian attention prediction is limited. To evaluate Context-SalNET, we recorded the first dataset of pedestrian visual attention in VR that includes explicit variation of the context factors urgency and safety preference. Context-SalNET achieves clear improvements over state-of-the-art saliency prediction approaches as well as over ablations. Our novel dataset will be made fully available and can serve as a valuable resource for further research on pedestrian attention prediction. ",

We formulate the channel allocation problem as an unsupervised learning problem, parameterize the control policy of radio channels with graph neural networks (GNNs), and train GNNs with the policy gradient method in a model-free manner. The proposed approach allows for a decentralized implementation due to the distributed nature of GNNs and is equivariant to network permutations. The former provides an efficient and scalable solution for large network scenarios, and the latter renders our algorithm independent of the AP reordering.

The proposed VIN-RS embeds a CNN trained on computed labels using the message passing mechanism of the Hidden Markov Model. The CNN processes images or graphs of the environment to predict the shaping values. Recent work on reward shaping still has limitations towards training on a representation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) and building an estimate of the transition matrix. The advantage of VIN-RS is to construct an effective potential function from an estimated MDP while automatically inferring the environment transition matrix. The proposed VIN-RS estimates the transition matrix through a self-learned convolution filter while extracting environment details from the input frames or sampled graphs. Due to (1) the previous success of using message passing for reward shaping; and (2) the CNN planning behavior, we use these messages to train the CNN of VIN-RS. Experiments are performed on tabular games, Atari 2600 and MuJoCo, for discrete and continuous action space.

We focus on low-rank Markov games whose transition matrix admits a hidden low-rank structure on top of an unknown non-linear representation. The goal is to design an algorithm that (1) finds an $\\varepsilon$-equilibrium policy sample efficiently without prior knowledge of the environment or the representation, and (2) permits a deep-learning friendly implementation. We leverage representation learning and present a model-based and a model-free approach to construct an effective representation from the collected data. For both approaches, the algorithm achieves a sample complexity of poly$(H,d,A,1/\\varepsilon)$, where $H$ is the game horizon, $d$ is the dimension of the feature vector, $A$ is the size of the joint action space and $\\varepsilon$ is the optimality gap. When the number of players is large, the above sample complexity can scale exponentially with the number of players in the worst case. To address this challenge, we consider Markov games with a factorized transition structure and present an algorithm that escapes such exponential scaling. To our best knowledge, this is the first sample-efficient algorithm for multi-agent general-sum Markov games that incorporates (non-linear) function approximation.

High current Low Impedance Faults (LIF) are typically detected and mitigated via over-current, distance, directional relays, fuses, etc. In contrast, while High Impedance Faults (HIF) are equally hazardous, they are much more challenging to detect due to the fault current being much lower than load currents and their time-varying and nonlinear behaviour. Moreover, New Zealand distribution networks are extensive and largely unmonitored beyond the substation, and suitable HIF detection schemes are still an ongoing research challenge. To date, we have built a physical test facility for power system fault analysis and developing and evaluating our sensing and fault detection system. We have simulated LIF and HIF with different fault surface materials and load-switching events. From the data collected, we have characterized the unique fault behaviour for both LIF and HIF in 400V networks and trained a Deep Learning classifier to recognize the type of fault present from its unique signature. We have developed an outdoor pole mountable sensing system and have installed this in Wellington Electricity's network for ongoing data collection and evaluation. This paper will describe the test facility and our experience developing and implementing the sensing system. The widest range of HIF phenomena observed was in the fault experiments involving the tree branch. For brevity, therefore, this paper reports on the results of just these tree-branch experiments. HIF faults on other surface materials will be reported elsewhere. Finally, we will detail the pole-mountable sensing system installed in Wellington Electricity's network and the outcomes thus far. ",

Our method mainly contains three steps. First, a gradient-based method is adopted to find the most vulnerable words in the sentence. Then we split the selected words into subtokens to replace the origin tokenization result from the transformer tokenizer. Finally, we utilize an adversarial loss to guide the substitution of attachable subtokens in which the Gumbel-softmax trick is introduced to ensure gradient propagation. Meanwhile, we introduce the visual and length constraint in the optimization process to achieve minimum character modifications. Extensive experiments on both sentence-level and token-level tasks demonstrate that our method could outperform the previous attack methods in terms of success rate and edit distance.

    "abstract": "In the software engineering community, deep learning (DL) has recently been applied to many source code processing tasks. Due to the poor interpretability of DL models, their security vulnerabilities require scrutiny. Recently, researchers have identified an emergent security threat, namely poison attack. The attackers aim to inject insidious backdoors into models by poisoning the training data with poison samples. Poisoned models work normally with clean inputs but produce targeted erroneous results with poisoned inputs embedded with triggers. By activating backdoors, attackers can manipulate the poisoned models in security-related scenarios. To verify the vulnerability of existing deep source code processing models to the poison attack, we present a poison attack framework for source code named CodePoisoner as a strong imaginary enemy. CodePoisoner can produce compilable even human-imperceptible poison samples and attack models by poisoning the training data with poison samples. To defend against the poison attack, we further propose an effective defense approach named CodeDetector to detect poison samples in the training data. CodeDetector can be applied to many model architectures and effectively defend against multiple poison attack approaches. We apply our CodePoisoner and CodeDetector to three tasks, including defect detection, clone detection, and code repair. The results show that (1) CodePoisoner achieves a high attack success rate (max: 100%) in misleading models to targeted erroneous behaviors. It validates that existing deep source code processing models have a strong vulnerability to the poison attack. (2) CodeDetector effectively defends against multiple poison attack approaches by detecting (max: 100%) poison samples in the training data. We hope this work can help practitioners notice the poison attack and inspire the design of more advanced defense techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Benefit from flexible network designs and end-to-end joint optimization approach, learned image compression (LIC) has demonstrated excellent coding performance and practical feasibility in recent years. However, existing compression models suffer from serious multi-generation loss, which always occurs during image editing and transcoding. During the process of repeatedly encoding and decoding, the quality of the image will rapidly degrade, resulting in various types of distortion, which significantly limits the practical application of LIC. In this paper, a thorough analysis is carried out to determine the source of generative loss in successive image compression (SIC). We point out and solve the quantization drift problem that affects SIC, reversibility loss function as well as channel relaxation method are proposed to further reduce the generation loss. Experiments show that by using our proposed solutions, LIC can achieve comparable performance to the first compression of BPG even after 50 times reencoding without any change of the network structure.

    "abstract": "Developers often perform repetitive code editing activities for various reasons (e.g., code refactor) during software development. Many deep learning models are applied to automate code editing by learning from the code editing history. Recently, pre-trained code editing models have achieved the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Pre-trained models are first pre-trained with pre-training tasks and fine-tuned with the code editing task. Existing pre-training tasks mainly are code infilling tasks (e.g., masked language modeling), which are derived from the natural language processing field and are not designed for code editing. In this paper, we propose a pre-training task specialized in code editing and present an effective pre-trained code editing model named CodeEditor. Our pre-training task further improves the performance and generalization ability of code editing models. Specifically, we collect real-world code snippets as the ground truth and use a generator to rewrite them into natural but inferior versions. Then, we pre-train our CodeEditor to edit inferior versions into the ground truth, to learn edit patterns. We conduct experiments on four datasets and evaluate models in three settings. (1) In the fine-tuning setting, we fine-tune the pre-trained CodeEditor with four datasets. CodeEditor outperforms SOTA baselines by 15%, 25.5%, and 9.4% and 26.6% on four datasets. (2) In the few-shot setting, we fine-tune the pre-trained CodeEditor with limited data. CodeEditor substantially performs better than all baselines, even outperforming baselines that are fine-tuned with all data. (3) In the zero-shot setting, we evaluate the pre-trained CodeEditor without fine-tuning. CodeEditor correctly edits 1,113 programs while SOTA baselines can not work. The results prove that the superiority of our pre-training task and the pre-trained CodeEditor is more effective in automatic code editing. ",

    "abstract": "Neural Network (NN) models provide potential to speed up the drug discovery process and reduce its failure rates. The success of NN models require uncertainty quantification (UQ) as drug discovery explores chemical space beyond the training data distribution. Standard NN models do not provide uncertainty information. Methods that combine Bayesian models with NN models address this issue, but are difficult to implement and more expensive to train. Some methods require changing the NN architecture or training procedure, limiting the selection of NN models. Moreover, predictive uncertainty can come from different sources. It is important to have the ability to separately model different types of predictive uncertainty, as the model can take assorted actions depending on the source of uncertainty. In this paper, we examine UQ methods that estimate different sources of predictive uncertainty for NN models aiming at drug discovery. We use our prior knowledge on chemical compounds to design the experiments. By utilizing a visualization method we create non-overlapping and chemically diverse partitions from a collection of chemical compounds. These partitions are used as training and test set splits to explore NN model uncertainty. We demonstrate how the uncertainties estimated by the selected methods describe different sources of uncertainty under different partitions and featurization schemes and the relationship to prediction error.

We consider the storage aspect of CCS, which involves injecting carbon dioxide into underground reservoirs. This requires accurate and high-resolution predictions of carbon dioxide plume migration and reservoir pressure buildup. However, such modeling is challenging at scale due to the high computational costs of existing numerical methods. We introduce a novel machine learning approach for four-dimensional spatial-temporal modeling, which speeds up predictions nearly 700,000 times compared to existing methods. It provides highly accurate predictions under diverse reservoir conditions, geological heterogeneity, and injection schemes. Our framework, Nested Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), learns the solution operator for the family of partial differential equations governing the carbon dioxide-water multiphase flow. It uses a hierarchy of FNO models to produce outputs at different refinement levels. Thus, our approach enables unprecedented real-time high-resolution modeling for carbon dioxide storage. ",

    "abstract": "The recent decade has seen an enormous rise in the popularity of deep learning and neural networks. These algorithms have broken many previous records and achieved remarkable results. Their outstanding performance has significantly sped up the progress of AI, and so far various milestones have been achieved earlier than expected. However, in the case of relatively small datasets, the performance of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) may suffer from reduced accuracy compared to other Machine Learning models. Furthermore, it is difficult to construct prediction intervals or evaluate the uncertainty of predictions when dealing with regression tasks. In this paper, we propose an ensemble method that attempts to estimate the uncertainty of predictions, increase their accuracy and provide an interval for the expected variation. Compared with traditional DNNs that only provide a prediction, our proposed method can output a prediction interval by combining DNNs, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and dissimilarity computation techniques. Albeit the simple design, this approach significantly increases accuracy on small datasets and does not introduce much complexity to the architecture of the neural network. The proposed method is tested on various datasets, and a significant improvement in the performance of the neural network model is seen. The model's prediction interval can include the ground truth value at an average rate of 71% and 78% across training sizes of 90% and 55%, respectively. Finally, we highlight other aspects and applications of the approach in experimental error estimation, and the application of transfer learning. ",

To fill this gap, we propose a distributed multi-agent learning model inspired by human collaboration, in which the agents can autonomously detect suitable collaborators and refer to collaborators' model for better performance. To implement such adaptive collaboration, we use a collaboration graph to indicate the pairwise collaborative relation. The collaboration graph can be obtained by graph learning techniques based on model similarity between different agents. Since model similarity can not be formulated by a fixed graphical optimization, we design a graph learning network by unrolling, which can learn underlying similar features among potential collaborators. By testing on both regression and classification tasks, we validate that our proposed collaboration model can figure out accurate collaborative relationship and greatly improve agents' learning performance.

In China, for example, nearly all criminal judges make decisions based on the Four Elements Theory (FET).In this paper, we argue that trustworthy charge prediction models should take legal theories into consideration, and standing on prior studies in model interpretation, we propose three principles for trustworthy models should follow in this task, which are sensitive, selective, and presumption of innocence.We further design a new framework to evaluate whether existing charge prediction models learn legal theories.

Face recognition consists of three sub-task: face detection, face normalizing and face identification. Most of animal face recognition study focuses on face detection and face identification. Animals are often uncooperative when taking photos, so the collected animal face images are often in arbitrary directions. The use of non-standard images may significantly reduce the performance of face recognition system. However, there is no study on normalizing of the animal face image with arbitrary directions. In this study, we developed a light-weight angle detection and region-based convolutional network (LAD-RCNN) containing a new rotation angle coding method that can detect the rotation angle and the location of animal face in one-stage. LAD-RCNN has a frame rate of 72.74 FPS (including all steps) on a single GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU. LAD-RCNN has been evaluated on multiple dataset including goat dataset and gaot infrared image. Evaluation result show that the AP of face detection was more than 95% and the deviation between the detected rotation angle and the ground-truth rotation angle were less than 0.036 (i.e. 6.48{\\deg}) on all the test dataset. This shows that LAD-RCNN has excellent performance on livestock face and its direction detection, and therefore it is very suitable for livestock face detection and Normalizing.

This paper introduces a simulation of a well-known batch processing problem in the literature. Evolutionary algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE) are used to find the optimal schedule for the simulation. We then compare the quality of solutions obtained by the surrogate-assisted versions of the algorithms against the baseline algorithms. Surrogate-assistance is achieved through Probablistic Surrogate-Assisted Framework (PSAF). The results highlight the potential for improving baseline evolutionary algorithms through surrogates. For different time horizons, the solutions are evaluated with respect to several quality indicators. It is shown that the PSAF assisted GA (PSAF-GA) and PSAF-assisted DE (PSAF-DE) provided improvement in some time horizons. In others, they either maintained the solutions or showed some deterioration. The results also highlight the need to tune the hyper-parameters used by the surrogate-assisted framework, as the surrogate, in some instances, shows some deterioration over the baseline algorithm.

    "abstract": "Aside from graph neural networks (GNNs) catching significant attention as a powerful framework revolutionizing graph representation learning, there has been an increasing demand for explaining GNN models. Although various explanation methods for GNNs have been developed, most studies have focused on instance-level explanations, which produce explanations tailored to a given graph instance. In our study, we propose Prototype-bAsed GNN-Explainer (PAGE), a novel model-level GNN explanation method that explains what the underlying GNN model has learned for graph classification by discovering human-interpretable prototype graphs. Our method produces explanations for a given class, thus being capable of offering more concise and comprehensive explanations than those of instance-level explanations. First, PAGE selects embeddings of class-discriminative input graphs on the graph-level embedding space after clustering them. Then, PAGE discovers a common subgraph pattern by iteratively searching for high matching node tuples using node-level embeddings via a prototype scoring function, thereby yielding a prototype graph as our explanation. Using five graph classification datasets, we demonstrate that PAGE qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms the state-of-the-art model-level explanation method. We also carry out experimental studies systematically by showing the relationship between PAGE and instance-level explanation methods, the robustness of PAGE to input data scarce environments, and the computational efficiency of the proposed prototype scoring function in PAGE.

    "abstract": "Efficient document retrieval heavily relies on the technique of semantic hashing, which learns a binary code for every document and employs Hamming distance to evaluate document distances. However, existing semantic hashing methods are mostly established on outdated TFIDF features, which obviously do not contain lots of important semantic information about documents. Furthermore, the Hamming distance can only be equal to one of several integer values, significantly limiting its representational ability for document distances. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose to leverage BERT embeddings to perform efficient retrieval based on the product quantization technique, which will assign for every document a real-valued codeword from the codebook, instead of a binary code as in semantic hashing. Specifically, we first transform the original BERT embeddings via a learnable mapping and feed the transformed embedding into a probabilistic product quantization module to output the assigned codeword. The refining and quantizing modules can be optimized in an end-to-end manner by minimizing the probabilistic contrastive loss. A mutual information maximization based method is further proposed to improve the representativeness of codewords, so that documents can be quantized more accurately. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines. ",

As a result, directly searching in such a large search space is non-trivial and also very time-consuming. To address the above issues, in each search step, we seek to limit the search space to a small but effective subspace to boost both the search performance and search efficiency. To this end, we propose a novel Neural Architecture Search method via Automatic Subspace Evoking (ASE-NAS) that finds promising architectures in automatically evoked subspaces. Specifically, we first perform a global search, i.e., automatic subspace evoking, to evoke/find a good subspace from a set of candidates. Then, we perform a local search within the evoked subspace to find an effective architecture. More critically, we further boost search performance by taking well-designed/searched architectures as the initial candidate subspaces. Extensive experiments show that our ASE-NAS not only greatly reduces the search cost but also finds better architectures than state-of-the-art methods in various benchmark search spaces. ",

On one side, we focus on speaker identity cues and represent them as speaker embeddings extracted using a state-of-the-art method for the automatic speaker verification task. On the other side, voice prosody, intended as variations in rhythm, pitch or accent in speech, is extracted through a specialized encoder. We show that the combination of these two embeddings fed to a supervised binary classifier allows the detection of deepfake speech generated with both Text-to-Speech and Voice Conversion techniques.

Bayesian networks are probabilistic graphical models that have been widely used in artificial intelligence applications. Their popularity stems from the fact they can be built by combining existing expert knowledge with data and are highly interpretable, which makes them useful for decision support, e.g. in healthcare. While some research has been published on the federated learning of Bayesian networks, publications on Bayesian networks in a vertically partitioned or heterogeneous data setting (where different variables are located in different datasets) are limited, and suffer from important omissions, such as the handling of missing data. In this article, we propose a novel method called VertiBayes to train Bayesian networks (structure and parameters) on vertically partitioned data, which can handle missing values as well as an arbitrary number of parties. For structure learning we adapted the widely used K2 algorithm with a privacy-preserving scalar product protocol. For parameter learning, we use a two-step approach: first, we learn an intermediate model using maximum likelihood by treating missing values as a special value and then we train a model on synthetic data generated by the intermediate model using the EM algorithm. The privacy guarantees of our approach are equivalent to the ones provided by the privacy preserving scalar product protocol used. We experimentally show our approach produces models comparable to those learnt using traditional algorithms and we estimate the increase in complexity in terms of samples, network size, and complexity. Finally, we propose two alternative approaches to estimate the performance of the model using vertically partitioned data and we show in experiments that they lead to reasonably accurate estimates.

    "abstract": "Which messages are more effective at inducing a change of opinion in the listener? We approach this question within the frame of Habermas' theory of communicative action, which posits that the illocutionary intent of the message (its pragmatic meaning) is the key. Thanks to recent advances in natural language processing, we are able to operationalize this theory by extracting the latent social dimensions of a message, namely archetypes of social intent of language, that come from social exchange theory. We identify key ingredients to opinion change by looking at more than 46k posts and more than 3.5M comments on Reddit's r/ChangeMyView, a debate forum where people try to change each other's opinion and explicitly mark opinion-changing comments with a special flag called \"delta\". Comments that express no intent are about 77% less likely to change the mind of the recipient, compared to comments that convey at least one social dimension. Among the various social dimensions, the ones that are most likely to produce an opinion change are knowledge, similarity, and trust, which resonates with Habermas' theory of communicative action. We also find other new important dimensions, such as appeals to power or empathetic expressions of support. Finally, in line with theories of constructive conflict, yet contrary to the popular characterization of conflict as the bane of modern social media, our findings show that voicing conflict in the context of a structured public debate can promote integration, especially when it is used to counter another conflictive stance. By leveraging recent advances in natural language processing, our work provides an empirical framework for Habermas' theory, finds concrete examples of its effects in the wild, and suggests its possible extension with a more faceted understanding of intent interpreted as social dimensions of language.

However, existing methods based on depth estimation or camera-driven attention are not stable to obtain transformation under noisy camera parameters, mainly with two challenges, accurate depth prediction and calibration. In this work, we present a completely Multi-Camera Calibration Free Transformer (CFT) for robust BEV representation, which focuses on exploring implicit mapping, not relied on camera intrinsics and extrinsics. To guide better feature learning from image views to BEV, CFT mines potential 3D information in BEV via our designed position-aware enhancement (PA). Instead of camera-driven point-wise or global transformation, for interaction within more effective region and lower computation cost, we propose a view-aware attention which also reduces redundant computation and promotes converge. CFT achieves 49.7% NDS on the nuScenes detection task leaderboard, which is the first work removing camera parameters, comparable to other geometry-guided methods. Without temporal input and other modal information, CFT achieves second highest performance with a smaller image input 1600 * 640. Thanks to view-attention variant, CFT reduces memory and transformer FLOPs for vanilla attention by about 12% and 60%, respectively, with improved NDS by 1.0%. Moreover, its natural robustness to noisy camera parameters makes CFT more competitive. ",

In this paper, drawing inspiration from the knowledge transfer ability of teacher-student architecture and the impressive feature extraction capability of recent neural networks, we design a teacher-student structured model for 3D anomaly detection. Specifically, we use feature space alignment, dimension zoom, and max pooling to extract the features of the point cloud and then minimize a multi-scale loss between the feature vectors produced by the teacher and the student networks. Moreover, our method only requires very few normal samples to train the student network due to the teacher-student distillation mechanism. Once trained, the teacher-student network pair can be leveraged jointly to fulfill 3D point cloud anomaly detection based on the calculated anomaly score. For evaluation, we compare our method against the reconstruction-based method on the ShapeNet-Part dataset. The experimental results and ablation studies quantitatively and qualitatively confirm that our model can achieve higher performance compared with the state of the arts in 3D anomaly detection with very few training samples.

As a frequency-selective device, RIS can only effectively shape the propagation of signals within a certain frequency band.

In this paper, with the consideration of the frequency-selective characteristics of RIS, we aim to jointly optimize BS-RIS-user association, active beamforming at BSs, and passive beamforming of RIS to maximize the sum-rate of a RIS-assisted cellular network. We first leverage $l_0$-norm to efficiently integrate BS-RIS-user association with active and passive beamforming. Then, we adopt fractional programming (FP) and block coordinate descent (BCD) methods to deal with logarithmic and fractional parts and decouple the joint association and beamforming design problem into several sub-problems. Efficient algorithms which combine $l_0$-norm approximation, majorization-minimization (MM), and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) are developed to alternately solve the sub-problems. Extensive simulation results illustrate the importance of BS-RIS-user association optimization in RIS-assisted cellular networks and verify the effectiveness of the proposed joint association and beamforming design algorithm.

    "abstract": "Supervised classification methods have been widely utilized for the quality assurance of the advanced manufacturing process, such as additive manufacturing (AM) for anomaly (defects) detection. However, since abnormal states (with defects) occur much less frequently than normal ones (without defects) in the manufacturing process, the number of sensor data samples collected from a normal state outweighs that from an abnormal state. This issue causes imbalanced training data for classification models, thus deteriorating the performance of detecting abnormal states in the process. It is beneficial to generate effective artificial sample data for the abnormal states to make a more balanced training set. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a novel data augmentation method based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) using additive manufacturing process image sensor data. The novelty of our approach is that a standard GAN and classifier are jointly optimized with techniques to stabilize the learning process of standard GAN. The diverse and high-quality generated samples provide balanced training data to the classifier. The iterative optimization between GAN and classifier provides the high-performance classifier. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by both open-source data and real-world case studies in polymer and metal AM processes. ",

To bridge this gap, this paper formally studies the cost optimization for distributed GNN processing over a multi-tier heterogeneous edge network. We build a comprehensive modeling framework that can capture a variety of different cost factors, based on which we formulate a cost-efficient graph layout optimization problem that is proved to be NP-hard. Instead of trivially applying traditional data placement wisdom, we theoretically reveal the structural property of quadratic submodularity implicated in GNN's unique computing pattern, which motivates our design of an efficient iterative solution exploiting graph cuts. Rigorous analysis shows that it provides parameterized constant approximation ratio, guaranteed convergence, and exact feasibility. To tackle potential graph topological evolution in GNN processing, we further devise an incremental update strategy and an adaptive scheduling algorithm for lightweight dynamic layout optimization. Evaluations with real-world datasets and various GNN benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance over de facto baselines with more than 95.8% cost eduction in a fast convergence speed.

However, these paradigm shifts may lead to numerous new security and privacy issues, which traditional security measures may not be able to deal with. To tackle these issues and build a trustworthy 6G network, we introduce a novel trust framework named as SIX-Trust, which composes of 3 layers: sustainable trust (S-Trust), infrastructure trust (I-Trust) and xenogenesis trust (X-Trust). Each layer plays a different role, and the importance of each layer varies for different application scenarios of 6G. For each layer, we briefly introduce its related enabling technologies, and demonstrate how these technologies can be applied to enhance trust and security of the 6G network.

We believe that CER can be useful for a broad class of learning tasks, including for any off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Sending and receiving signals is ubiquitous in the living world. It includes everything from individual molecules triggering complex metabolic cascades, to animals using signals to alert their group to the presence of predators. When communication involves common interest, simple sender-receiver games show how reliable signaling can emerge and evolve to transmit information effectively. These games have been analyzed extensively, with some work investigating the role of static network structure on information transfer. However, no existing work has examined the coevolution of strategy and network structure in sender-receiver games. Here we show that coevolution is sufficient to generate the endogenous formation of distinct groups from an initially homogeneous population. It also allows for the emergence of novel ``hybrid'' signaling groups that have not previously been considered or demonstrated in theory or nature. Hybrid groups are composed of different complementary signaling behaviors that rely on evolved network structure to achieve effective communication. Without this structure, such groups would normally fail to effectively communicate. Our findings pertain to all common interest signaling games, are robust across many parameters, and mitigate known problems of inefficient communication. Our work generates new insights for the theory of adaptive behavior, signaling, and group formation in natural and social systems across a wide range of environments in which changing network structure is common. We discuss implications for research on metabolic networks, among neurons, proteins, and social organisms. ",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous data fusion can enhance the robustness and accuracy of an algorithm on a given task. However, due to the difference in various modalities, aligning the sensors and embedding their information into discriminative and compact representations is challenging. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning based MultiModal Alignment Network (CoMMANet) to align data from different sensors into a shared and discriminative manifold where class information is preserved. The proposed architecture uses a multimodal triplet autoencoder to cluster the latent space in such a way that samples of the same classes from each heterogeneous modality are mapped close to each other. Since all the modalities exist in a shared manifold, a unified classification framework is proposed. The resulting latent space representations are fused to perform more robust and accurate classification. In a missing sensor scenario, the latent space of one sensor is easily and efficiently predicted using another sensor's latent space, thereby allowing sensor translation. We conducted extensive experiments on a manually labeled multimodal dataset containing hyperspectral data from AVIRIS-NG and NEON, and LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data from NEON. Lastly, the model is validated on two benchmark datasets: Berlin Dataset (hyperspectral and synthetic aperture radar) and MUUFL Gulfport Dataset (hyperspectral and LiDAR). A comparison made with other methods demonstrates the superiority of this method. We achieved a mean overall accuracy of 94.3% on the MUUFL dataset and the best overall accuracy of 71.26% on the Berlin dataset, which is better than other state-of-the-art approaches. ",

Specifically, we introduce a fine-grained network dropout strategy to the generator. With a specifically designed over-smooth handler which separates speech signal intro periodic and aperiodic components, we only perform network dropout to the aperodic components, which alleviates metallic sounding and maintains good speaker similarity. To further improve generalization ability, we introduce several data augmentation methods to augment fake data in the discriminator, including harmonic shift, harmonic noise and phase noise. Experiments show that Robust MelGAN can be used as a universal vocoder, significantly improving sound quality in TTS systems built on various types of data. ",

    "abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) and Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) are two major paradigms of policy optimization with distinct learning principles, i.e., gradient-based v.s. gradient free. An appealing research direction is integrating Deep RL and EA to devise new methods by fusing their complementary advantages. However, existing works on combining Deep RL and EA have two common drawbacks: 1) the RL agent and EA agents learn their policies individually, neglecting efficient sharing of useful common knowledge; 2) parameter-level policy optimization guarantees no semantic level of behavior evolution for the EA side. In this paper, we propose Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning with Two-scale State Representation and Policy Representation (ERL-Re2), a novel solution to the aforementioned two drawbacks. The key idea of ERL-Re2 is two-scale representation: all EA and RL policies share the same nonlinear state representation while maintaining individual linear policy representations. The state representation conveys expressive common features of the environment learned by all the agents collectively; the linear policy representation provides a favorable space for efficient policy optimization, where novel behavior-level crossover and mutation operations can be performed. Moreover, the linear policy representation allows convenient generalization of policy fitness with the help of Policy-extended Value Function Approximator (PeVFA), further improving the sample efficiency of fitness estimation. The experiments on a range of continuous control tasks show that ERL-Re2 consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves significant improvement over both its Deep RL and EA components. ",

It is difficult for ordinary users with less knowledge of graphs' complexity to set an appropriate $k$. Even if we define quite a large $k$, the community size returned by CS is often too large for users to gain much insight about it. Compared against the entire community, key-members in the community appear more valuable than others. To contend with this, we focus on a new problem, that is \\textbf{C}ommunity \\textbf{K}ey-members \\textbf{S}earch problem (CKS). We turn our perspective to the key-members in the community containing $q$ instead of the entire community. To solve CKS problem, we first propose an exact algorithm based on truss decomposition as the baseline. Then, we present four random walk-based optimized algorithms to achieve a trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency, by carefully considering some important cohesiveness features in the design of transition matrix. We return the top-$n$ key-members according to the stationary distribution when random walk converges. Moreover, we propose a lightweight refinement method following an \"expand-replace\" manner to further optimize the top-$n$ result with little overhead, and we extend our solution to support CKS with multiple query nodes. We also analyze our solution's effectiveness theoretically. Comprehensive experimental studies on various real-world datasets demonstrate our method's superiority. ",

However, performance metrics such as accuracy do not measure the quality of the model in terms of its ability to robustly represent complex linguistic structure. Further, the sheer size of LLMs makes it difficult to analyse them using standard robustness evaluation methods. In this work, we propose a framework to evaluate the robustness of linguistic representations using probing tasks. We argue that a robust linguistic model is one that is able to robustly and efficiently represent complex syntactic structure underlying the data distribution and propose appropriate robustness measures. We leverage recent advances in extracting emergent linguistic constructs from LLMs and apply syntax-preserving perturbations to test the stability of these constructs in order to better understand the representations learned by LLMs. Empirically, we study the performance of four LLMs across six different corpora on the proposed robustness measures. We provide evidence that context-free representation (e.g., GloVE) are in some cases competitive with context-dependent representations from modern LLMs (e.g., BERT), yet equally brittle to syntax-preserving manipulations. Emergent syntactic representations in neural networks are brittle, thus our work poses the attention on the risk of comparing such structures to those that are object of a long lasting debate in linguistics.

This paper presents a domain adaptation-based action recognition approach that uses adversarial learning in cross-domain settings to learn cross-domain action recognition. Supervised learning can train it on a large amount of labeled data from the source domain (daytime action sequences). However, it uses deep domain invariant features to perform unsupervised learning on many unlabelled data from the target domain (night-time action sequences). The resulting augmented model, named 3D-DiNet can be trained using standard backpropagation with an additional layer. It achieves SOTA performance on InFAR and XD145 actions datasets. ",

We examine the method of estimating embedded representations as probability distributions for the interpretation of fashion-specific abstract and difficult-to-understand terms. Terms, such as \"casual,\" \"adult-casual,'' \"beauty-casual,\" and \"formal,\" are extremely subjective and abstract and are difficult for both experts and non-experts to understand, which discourages users from trying new fashion.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through multifaceted experiments involving image and attribute mapping, image retrieval and re-ordering techniques, and a detailed theoretical/analytical discussion of the distance measure included in the loss function.

We then argue that the dataset splitting produces a high correlation between training and validation sets, saturating the task and thus achieving very high performance. We, therefore, use a different data pre-processing technique designed to reduce this effect and reproduce the results with the same configurations as before (input representation and model architectures).

Existing topic-based novelty detection methods work poorly on this problem because they do not perform semantic reasoning involving relations between named entities in the text and their background knowledge.

In this work, we introduce a novel gating architecture, named Globally Gated Deep Linear Networks (GGDLNs) where gating units are shared among all processing units in each layer, thereby decoupling the architectures of the nonlinear but unlearned gatings and the learned linear processing motifs. We derive exact equations for the generalization properties in these networks in the finite-width thermodynamic limit, defined by $P,N\\rightarrow\\infty, P/N\\sim O(1)$, where P and N are the training sample size and the network width respectively. We find that the statistics of the network predictor can be expressed in terms of kernels that undergo shape renormalization through a data-dependent matrix compared to the GP kernels. Our theory accurately captures the behavior of finite width GGDLNs trained with gradient descent dynamics. We show that kernel shape renormalization gives rise to rich generalization properties w.r.t. network width, depth and L2 regularization amplitude. Interestingly, networks with sufficient gating units behave similarly to standard ReLU networks. Although gatings in the model do not participate in supervised learning, we show the utility of unsupervised learning of the gating parameters. Additionally, our theory allows the evaluation of the network's ability for learning multiple tasks by incorporating task-relevant information into the gating units. In summary, our work is the first exact theoretical solution of learning in a family of nonlinear networks with finite width. The rich and diverse behavior of the GGDLNs suggests that they are helpful analytically tractable models of learning single and multiple tasks, in finite-width nonlinear deep networks. ",

    "abstract": "Agglomeration-based strategies are important both within adaptive refinement algorithms and to construct scalable multilevel algebraic solvers. In order to automatically perform agglomeration of polygonal grids, we propose the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to partition the connectivity graph of a computational mesh. GNNs have the advantage to process naturally and simultaneously both the graph structure of mesh and the geometrical information, such as the areas of the elements or their barycentric coordinates. This is not the case with other approaches such as METIS, a standard algorithm for graph partitioning which is meant to process only the graph information, or the k-means clustering algorithm, which can process only the geometrical information. Performance in terms of quality metrics is enhanced for Machine Learning (ML) strategies, with GNNs featuring a lower computational cost online. Such models also show a good degree of generalization when applied to more complex geometries, such as brain MRI scans, and the capability of preserving the quality of the grid. The effectiveness of these strategies is demonstrated also when applied to MultiGrid (MG) solvers in a Polygonal Discontinuous Galerkin (PolyDG) framework. ",

    "abstract": "As academic interest in procedural content generation (PCG) for games has increased, so has the need for methodologies for comparing and contrasting the output spaces of alternative PCG systems. In this paper we introduce and evaluate a novel approach for visualising the generative spaces of level generation systems, using embeddings extracted from a trained convolutional neural network. We evaluate the approach in terms of its ability to produce 2D visualisations of encoded game levels that correlate with their behavioural characteristics. The results across two alternative game domains, Super Mario and Boxoban, indicate that this approach is powerful in certain settings and that it has the potential to supersede alternative methods for visually comparing generative spaces. However its performance was also inconsistent across the domains investigated in this work, as well as it being susceptible to intermittent failure. We conclude that this method is worthy of further evaluation, but that future implementations of it would benefit from significant refinement. ",

However, the release of such graph data often raises privacy issue, and the graph privacy preservation has recently drawn much attention from the database community. While prior works on graph privacy preservation mainly focused on protecting the privacy of either the graph structure only or vertex attributes only, in this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for graph privacy preservation by considering attacks from both graph structures and vertex attributes, which transforms the original graph to a so-called kt-safe graph, via k-anonymity and t-closeness. We prove that the generation of a kt-safe graph is NP-hard, therefore, we propose a feasible framework for effectively and efficiently anonymizing a graph with low anonymization cost. In particular, we design a cost-model-based graph partitioning approach to enable our proposed divide-and-conquer strategy for the graph anonymization, and propose effective optimization techniques such as pruning method and a tree synopsis to improve the anonymization efficiency over large-scale graphs. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed kt-safe graph generation approach on both real and synthetic data sets. ",

    "abstract": "As the availability of imagery data continues to swell, so do the demands on transmission, storage and processing power. Processing requirements to handle this plethora of data is quickly outpacing the utility of conventional processing techniques. Transitioning to quantum processing and algorithms that offer promising efficiencies over conventional methods can address some of these issues. However, to make this transformation possible, fundamental issues of implementing real time Quantum algorithms must be overcome for crucial processes needed for intelligent analysis applications. For example, consider edge detection tasks which require time-consuming acquisition processes and are further hindered by the complexity of the devices used thus limiting feasibility for implementation in real-time applications. Convolution is another example of an operation that is essential for signal and image processing applications, where the mathematical operations consist of an intelligent mixture of multiplication and addition that require considerable computational resources. This paper studies a new paired transform-based quantum representation and computation of one-dimensional and 2-D signals convolutions and gradients. A new visual data representation is defined to simplify convolution calculations making it feasible to parallelize convolution and gradient operations for more efficient performance. The new data representation is demonstrated on multiple illustrative examples for quantum edge detection, gradients, and convolution. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed approach is shown on real-world images. ",

    "abstract": "Studying data memorization in neural language models helps us understand the risks (e.g., to privacy or copyright) associated with models regurgitating training data, and aids in the evaluation of potential countermeasures. Many prior works -- and some recently deployed defenses -- focus on \"verbatim memorization\", defined as a model generation that exactly matches a substring from the training set. We argue that verbatim memorization definitions are too restrictive and fail to capture more subtle forms of memorization. Specifically, we design and implement an efficient defense based on Bloom filters that perfectly prevents all verbatim memorization. And yet, we demonstrate that this \"perfect\" filter does not prevent the leakage of training data. Indeed, it is easily circumvented by plausible and minimally modified \"style-transfer\" prompts -- and in some cases even the non-modified original prompts -- to extract memorized information. For example, instructing the model to output ALL-CAPITAL texts bypasses memorization checks based on verbatim matching. We conclude by discussing potential alternative definitions and why defining memorization is a difficult yet crucial open question for neural language models. ",

In this work, ten models and four augmentation configurations are trained on the ISIC 2016 dataset. The performance and overfitting are compared utilizing five metrics. Our results show that the U-Net-Resnet50 and the R2U-Net have the highest metrics value, along with two data augmentation scenarios. We also investigate CBAM and AG blocks in the U-Net architecture, which enhances segmentation performance at a meager computational cost. In addition, we propose using pyramid, AG, and CBAM blocks in a sequence, which significantly surpasses the results of using the two individually. Finally, our experiments show that models that have exploited attention modules successfully overcome common skin lesion segmentation problems.

The Unistellar Network, made of more than 10,000 digital telescopes owned by citizen scientists, and is regularly used to record asteroid occultations. In order to process the increasing amount of observational produced by this network, we need a quick and reliable way to analyze occultations. In an effort to solve this problem, we trained a CNN with artificial images of stars with twenty different types of photometric signals. Inputs to the network consists of two stacks of snippet images of stars, one around the star that is supposed to be occulted and a reference star used for comparison. We need the reference star to distinguish between a true occultation and artefacts introduced by poor atmospheric condition. Our Occultation Detection Neural Network (ODNet), can analyze three sequence of stars per second with 91\\% of precision and 87\\% of recall. The algorithm is sufficiently fast and robust so we can envision incorporating onboard the eVscopes to deliver real-time results. We conclude that citizen science represents an important opportunity for the future studies and discoveries in the occultations, and that application of artificial intelligence will permit us to to take better advantage of the ever-growing quantity of data to categorize asteroids.

Our previous work has established a deep paradigm to decompose the articulatory kinematics data into gestures, which explicitly model the phonological and linguistic structure encoded with human speech production mechanism, and corresponding gestural scores. We continue with this line of work by raising two concerns: (1) The articulators are entangled together in the original algorithm such that some of the articulators do not leverage effective moving patterns, which limits the interpretability of both gestures and gestural scores; (2) The EMA data is sparsely sampled from articulators, which limits the intelligibility of learned representations. In this work, we propose a novel articulatory representation decomposition algorithm that takes the advantage of guided factor analysis to derive the articulatory-specific factors and factor scores. A neural convolutive matrix factorization algorithm is then employed on the factor scores to derive the new gestures and gestural scores. We experiment with the rtMRI corpus that captures the fine-grained vocal tract contours. Both subjective and objective evaluation results suggest that the newly proposed system delivers the articulatory representations that are intelligible, generalizable, efficient and interpretable. ",

In this work, we address this issue by proposing a procedure that automatically learns representations with controlled measures of ill-posedness. Our method approximates a linear representation defined by the spectral decomposition of a conditional expectation operator, which can be used for kernelized estimators and is known to facilitate minimax optimal estimation in certain settings. We show this representation can be efficiently estimated from data, and establish L2 consistency for the resulting estimator.

The IRS phase shifts are adjusted so as to maximize the ideal SNR (i.e., without CSI error), based only on the estimated channels. First, we derive a closed-form expression of the worst-case SNR, and then formulate the robust (discrete) optimization problem. Moreover, we design and analyze a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that is theoretically guaranteed to achieve the global maximum with polynomial complexity $O(L \\log L)$, where $L$ is the number of IRS elements. Finally, numerical simulations confirm the theoretical results.

Since estimating the noise impact on circuit reliability is an essential step toward understanding and mitigating noise, we propose to leverage classical ML to predict noise impact on circuit fidelity. Inspired by the natural graph representation of quantum circuits, we propose to leverage a graph transformer model to predict the noisy circuit fidelity. We firstly collect a large dataset with a variety of quantum circuits and obtain their fidelity on noisy simulators and real machines. Then we embed each circuit into a graph with gate and noise properties as node features, and adopt a graph transformer to predict the fidelity. Evaluated on 5 thousand random and algorithm circuits, the graph transformer predictor can provide accurate fidelity estimation with RMSE error 0.04 and outperform a simple neural network-based model by 0.02 on average. It can achieve 0.99 and 0.95 R$^2$ scores for random and algorithm circuits, respectively. Compared with circuit simulators, the predictor has over 200X speedup for estimating the fidelity. ",

    "abstract": "Domain Adaptation (DA) has recently received significant attention due to its potential to adapt a learning model across source and target domains with mismatched distributions. Since DA methods rely exclusively on the given source and target domain samples, they generally yield models that are vulnerable to noise and unable to adapt to unseen samples from the target domain, which calls for DA methods that guarantee the robustness and generalization of the learned models. In this paper, we propose DRDA, a distributionally robust domain adaptation method. DRDA leverages a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework to learn a robust decision function that minimizes the worst-case target domain risk and generalizes to any sample from the target domain by transferring knowledge from a given labeled source domain sample. We utilize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric to construct an ambiguity set of distributions that provably contains the source and target domain distributions with high probability. Hence, the risk is shown to upper bound the out-of-sample target domain loss. Our experimental results demonstrate that our formulation outperforms existing robust learning approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Semantic communication enables intelligent agents to extract meaning (or semantics) of information via interaction, to carry out collaborative tasks. In this paper, we study semantic communication from a topological space perspective, in which higher-order data semantics live in a simplicial complex. Specifically, a transmitter first maps its data into a $k$-order simplicial complex and then learns its high-order correlations. The simplicial structure and corresponding features are encoded into semantic embeddings in latent space for transmission. Subsequently, the receiver decodes the structure and infers the missing or distorted data. The transmitter and receiver collaboratively train a simplicial convolutional autoencoder to accomplish the semantic communication task. Experiments are carried out on a real dataset of Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus, where one part of the semantic embedding is missing or distorted during communication. Numerical results show that the simplicial convolutional autoencoder enabled semantic communication effectively rebuilds the simplicial features and infer the missing data with $95\\%$ accuracy, while achieving stable performance under channel noise. In contrast, the conventional autoencoder enabled communication fails to infer any missing data. Moreover, our approach is shown to effectively infer the distorted data without prior simplicial structure knowledge at the receiver, by learning extracted semantic information during communications. Leveraging the topological nature of information, the proposed method is also shown to be more reliable and efficient compared to several baselines, notably at low signal-to-noise (SNR) levels. ",

Recently, many studies have shown that brain network pattern containing rich spatial and temporal structure information, which represented the activation information of brain under external stimuli. %Therefore, the research of decoding stimuli from brain network received extensive more attention. The traditional method is to extract brain network features directly from the common machine learning method, then put these features into the classifier, and realize to decode external stimuli. However, this method cannot effectively extract the multi-dimensional structural information, which is hidden in the brain network. The tensor researchers show that the tensor decomposition model can fully mine unique spatio-temporal structure characteristics in multi-dimensional structure data. This research proposed a stimulus constrain tensor brain model(STN), which involved the tensor decomposition idea and stimulus category constraint information. The model was verified on the real neuroimaging data sets (MEG and fMRI). The experimental results show that the STN model achieved more $11.06\\%$ and $18.46\\%$ compared with others methods on two modal data sets. These results imply the superiority of extracting discriminative characteristics about STN model, especially for decoding object stimuli with semantic information. \\end{abstract} ",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this work is the systematic comparison of the application of two artificial neural networks (ANNs) to the surrogate modeling of the stress field in materially heterogeneous periodic polycrystalline microstructures. The first ANN is a UNet-based convolutional neural network (CNN) for periodic data, and the second is based on Fourier neural operators (FNO). Both of these were trained, validated, and tested with results from the numerical solution of the boundary-value problem (BVP) for quasi-static mechanical equilibrium in periodic grain microstructures with square domains. More specifically, these ANNs were trained to correlate the spatial distribution of material properties with the equilibrium stress field under uniaxial tensile loading. The resulting trained ANNs (tANNs) calculate the stress field for a given microstructure on the order of 1000 (UNet) to 2500 (FNO) times faster than the numerical solution of the corresponding BVP. For microstructures in the test dataset, the FNO-based tANN, or simply FNO, is more accurate than its UNet-based counterpart; the normalized mean absolute error of different stress components for the former is 0.25-0.40% as compared to 1.41-2.15% for the latter. Errors in FNO are restricted to grain boundary regions, whereas the error in U-Net also comes from within the grain. In comparison to U-Net, errors in FNO are more robust to large variations in spatial resolution as well as small variations in grain density. On other hand, errors in U-Net are robust to variations in boundary box aspect ratio, whereas errors in FNO increase as the domain becomes rectangular. Both tANNs are however unable to reproduce strong stress gradients, especially around regions of stress concentration. ",

Despite the advances in 3D acquisition techniques, the developed motion estimation algorithms in particle tracking remain great challenges of large particle displacements, dense particle distributions and high computational cost. By introducing a novel deep neural network based on recurrent Graph Optimal Transport, called GotFlow3D, we present an end-to-end solution to learn the 3D fluid flow motion from double-frame particle sets. The proposed network constructs two graphs in the geometric and feature space and further enriches the original particle representations with the fused intrinsic and extrinsic features learnt from a graph neural network. The extracted deep features are subsequently utilized to make optimal transport plans indicating the correspondences of particle pairs, which are then iteratively and adaptively retrieved to guide the recurrent flow learning. Experimental evaluations, including assessments on numerical experiments and validations on real-world experiments, demonstrate that the proposed GotFlow3D achieves state-of-the-art performance against both recently-developed scene flow learners and particle tracking algorithms, with impressive accuracy, robustness and generalization ability, which can provide deeper insight into the complex dynamics of broad physical and biological systems.

Distinguishing emotional brain states from other brain states using fMRI data has proven to be challenging due to two factors: a difficulty to generate fast yet accurate predictions in short time frames, and a difficulty to extract emotion features which generalize to unseen subjects. To address these challenges, we conducted an experiment in which 22 subjects viewed pictures designed to stimulate either negative, neutral or rest emotional responses while their brain activity was measured using fMRI. We then developed two distinct Convolution-based approaches to decode emotional brain states using only spatial information from single, minimally pre-processed (slice timing and realignment) fMRI volumes. In our first approach, we trained a 1D Convolutional Network (84.9% accuracy; chance level 33%) to classify 3 emotion conditions using One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) voxel selection combined with hyperalignment. In our second approach, we trained a 3D ResNet-50 model (78.0% accuracy; chance level 50%) to classify 2 emotion conditions from single 3D fMRI volumes directly. Our Convolutional and Residual classifiers successfully learned group-level emotion features and could decode emotion conditions from fMRI volumes in milliseconds. These approaches could potentially be used in brain computer interfaces and real-time fMRI neurofeedback research. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning is an increasingly popular tool with some success in predicting stock prices. One promising method is the Trader-Company~(TC) method, which takes into account the dynamism of the stock market and has both high predictive power and interpretability. Machine learning-based stock prediction methods including the TC method have been concentrating on point prediction. However, point prediction in the absence of uncertainty estimates lacks credibility quantification and raises concerns about safety. The challenge in this paper is to make an investment strategy that combines high predictive power and the ability to quantify uncertainty. We propose a novel approach called Uncertainty Aware Trader-Company Method~(UTC) method. The core idea of this approach is to combine the strengths of both frameworks by merging the TC method with the probabilistic modeling, which provides probabilistic predictions and uncertainty estimations. We expect this to retain the predictive power and interpretability of the TC method while capturing the uncertainty. We theoretically prove that the proposed method estimates the posterior variance and does not introduce additional biases from the original TC method. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our approach based on the synthetic and real market datasets. We confirm with synthetic data that the UTC method can detect situations where the uncertainty increases and the prediction is difficult. We also confirmed that the UTC method can detect abrupt changes in data generating distributions. We demonstrate with real market data that the UTC method can achieve higher returns and lower risks than baselines. ",

Traditional GNN methods use only the atoms in a drug molecule as nodes to obtain the representation of the molecular graph through node information passing, whereas the method using the transformer can only extract information about the nodes. However, the covalent bonding and chirality of a drug molecule have a great influence on the pharmacological properties of the molecule, and these information are implied in the chemical bonds formed by the edges between the atoms. In addition, CNN methods for modelling cell lines genomics sequences can only perceive local rather than global information about the sequence. In order to solve the above problems, we propose the decoupled dual transformer structure with edge embedded for drug respond prediction (TransEDRP), which is used for the representation of cell line genomics and drug respectively. For the drug branch, we encoded the chemical bond information within the molecule as the embedding of the edge in the molecular graph, extracted the global structural and biochemical information of the drug molecule using graph transformer. For the branch of cell lines genomics, we use the multi-headed attention mechanism to globally represent the genomics sequence. Finally, the drug and genomics branches are fused to predict IC50 values through the transformer layer and the fully connected layer, which two branches are different modalities. Extensive experiments have shown that our method is better than the current mainstream approach in all evaluation indicators. ",

    "title": "Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement and Separation by Leveraging Multi-Modal  Self-Supervised Embeddings",
    "abstract": "AV-HuBERT, a multi-modal self-supervised learning model, has been shown to be effective for categorical problems such as automatic speech recognition and lip-reading. This suggests that useful audio-visual speech representations can be obtained via utilizing multi-modal self-supervised embeddings. Nevertheless, it is unclear if such representations can be generalized to solve real-world multi-modal AV regression tasks, such as audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) and audio-visual speech separation (AVSS). In this study, we leveraged the pre-trained AV-HuBERT model followed by an SE module for AVSE and AVSS. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model performs better than the state-of-the-art AVSE and traditional audio-only SE models. In summary, our results confirm the effectiveness of our proposed model for the AVSS task with proper fine-tuning strategies, demonstrating that multi-modal self-supervised embeddings obtained from AV-HUBERT can be generalized to audio-visual regression tasks.

    "title": "Convergence Guarantees of a Distributed Network Equivalence Algorithm  for Distribution-OPF",
    "abstract": "The massive integration of distributed energy resources changes the operational demands of the electric power distribution system, motivating optimization-based approaches. The added computational complexities of the resulting optimal power flow (OPF) problem have generally been managed by approximated or relaxed models; however, they may lead to infeasible or inaccurate solutions. Decomposition-based methods have also been used to solve the OPF problems. But the existing methods require several message passing rounds for relatively small systems, causing significant delays in decision making; related feedback-based methods also suffer from slow tracking of the optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a provably convergent distributed algorithm to solve the nonlinear OPF problem for power distribution systems. Our method is based on a previously developed decomposition-based optimization method that employs the network equivalence method. We present a thorough mathematical analysis that includes sufficient conditions that guarantee convergence of the method. We also present simulation results using the IEEE-123 bus test system to demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness and provide additional insights into theoretical results. ",
