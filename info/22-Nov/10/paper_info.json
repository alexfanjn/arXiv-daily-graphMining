    "abstract": "Current natural language processing (NLP) models such as BERT and RoBERTa have achieved high overall performance, but they often make systematic errors due to bias or certain difficult features to learn. Thus research on slice detection models (SDM) which automatically identifies underperforming groups of datapoints has gradually caught more attention, which aims at both understanding model behaviors and providing insights for future model training and designing. However, there is little systematic research on SDM and quantitative evaluation of its assessment for NLP models. Our paper fills this gap by proposing \"Discover, Explanation, Improvement\" framework that discovers coherent and underperforming groups of datapoints and unites datapoints of each slice under human-understandable concepts; it also provides comprehensive evaluation tasks and the corresponding quantitative metrics, which enable convenient comparison for future works. Results show that our framework can accurately select error-prone datapoints with informative semantic features that summarize error patterns, based on which it directly boosts model performance by an average of 2.85 points based on trained models without tuning any parameters across multiple datasets.

    "abstract": "Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is one of the most established state estimation methods for mobile platforms. However, when visual tracking fails, VIO algorithms quickly diverge due to rapid error accumulation during inertial data integration. This error is typically modeled as a combination of additive Gaussian noise and a slowly changing bias which evolves as a random walk. In this work, we propose to train a neural network to learn the true bias evolution. We implement and compare two common sequential deep learning architectures: LSTMs and Transformers. Our approach follows from recent learning-based inertial estimators, but, instead of learning a motion model, we target IMU bias explicitly, which allows us to generalize to locomotion patterns unseen in training. We show that our proposed method improves state estimation in visually challenging situations across a wide range of motions by quadrupedal robots, walking humans, and drones. Our experiments show an average 15% reduction in drift rate, with much larger reductions when there is total vision failure. Importantly, we also demonstrate that models trained with one locomotion pattern (human walking) can be applied to another (quadruped robot trotting) without retraining. ",

    "abstract": "Wildfires are a common problem in many areas of the world with often catastrophic consequences. A number of systems have been created to provide early warnings of wildfires, including those that use satellite data to detect fires. The increased availability of small satellites, such as CubeSats, allows the wildfire detection response time to be reduced by deploying constellations of multiple satellites over regions of interest. By using machine learned components on-board the satellites, constraints which limit the amount of data that can be processed and sent back to ground stations can be overcome. There are hazards associated with wildfire alert systems, such as failing to detect the presence of a wildfire, or detecting a wildfire in the incorrect location. It is therefore necessary to be able to create a safety assurance case for the wildfire alert ML component that demonstrates it is sufficiently safe for use. This paper describes in detail how a safety assurance case for an ML wildfire alert system is created. This represents the first fully developed safety case for an ML component containing explicit argument and evidence as to the safety of the machine learning. ",

    "abstract": "The many successes of deep neural networks (DNNs) over the past decade have largely been driven by computational scale rather than insights from biological intelligence. Here, we explore if these trends have also carried concomitant improvements in explaining the visual strategies humans rely on for object recognition. We do this by comparing two related but distinct properties of visual strategies in humans and DNNs: where they believe important visual features are in images and how they use those features to categorize objects. Across 84 different DNNs trained on ImageNet and three independent datasets measuring the where and the how of human visual strategies for object recognition on those images, we find a systematic trade-off between DNN categorization accuracy and alignment with human visual strategies for object recognition. State-of-the-art DNNs are progressively becoming less aligned with humans as their accuracy improves. We rectify this growing issue with our neural harmonizer: a general-purpose training routine that both aligns DNN and human visual strategies and improves categorization accuracy. Our work represents the first demonstration that the scaling laws that are guiding the design of DNNs today have also produced worse models of human vision. We release our code and data at https://serre-lab.github.io/Harmonization to help the field build more human-like DNNs. ",

Current approaches to clinical SP are largely based on traditional machine learning and require hand-building a lexicon. The recent advancements in neural SP show a promise for building a robust and flexible semantic parser without much human effort. Thus, in this paper, we aim to systematically assess the performance of two such neural SP models for EHR question answering (QA). We found that the performance of these advanced neural models on two clinical SP datasets is promising given their ease of application and generalizability. Our error analysis surfaces the common types of errors made by these models and has the potential to inform future research into improving the performance of neural SP models for EHR QA. ",

    "abstract": "Artificial neural networks are functions depending on a finite number of parameters typically encoded as weights and biases. The identification of the parameters of the network from finite samples of input-output pairs is often referred to as the \\emph{teacher-student model}, and this model has represented a popular framework for understanding training and generalization. Even if the problem is NP-complete in the worst case, a rapidly growing literature -- after adding suitable distributional assumptions -- has established finite sample identification of two-layer networks with a number of neurons $m=\\mathcal O(D)$, $D$ being the input dimension. For the range $D<m<D^2$ the problem becomes harder, and truly little is known for networks parametrized by biases as well. This paper fills the gap by providing constructive methods and theoretical guarantees of finite sample identification for such wider shallow networks with biases. Our approach is based on a two-step pipeline: first, we recover the direction of the weights, by exploiting second order information; next, we identify the signs by suitable algebraic evaluations, and we recover the biases by empirical risk minimization via gradient descent. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ",

We model the environment as a random network of users in which each news item propagates in the network in consecutive cascades. Existing studies suggest that the cascade behaviors of misinformation and correct information are affected differently by user polarization and reflexivity. We show that this difference can be used to alter network dynamics in a way that selectively hinders the spread of misinformation content. To implement these alterations, we introduce an optimization-based probabilistic dropout method that randomly removes connections between users to achieve minimal propagation of misinformation. We use disciplined convex programming to optimize these removal probabilities over a reduced space of possible network alterations. We test the algorithm's effectiveness using simulated social networks. In our tests, we use both synthetic network structures based on stochastic block models, and natural network structures that are generated using random sampling of a dataset collected from Twitter. The results show that on average the algorithm decreases the cascade size of misinformation content by up to $70\\%$ in synthetic network tests and up to $45\\%$ in natural network tests while maintaining a branching ratio of at least $1.5$ for correct information.

To gain a better understanding of the interaction between community members and dispatchers using text-based risk reporting systems, this study conducts a system log analysis of LiveSafe, a community safety reporting system, to provide empirical evidence of the conversational patterns between users and dispatchers using both quantitative and qualitative methods. We created an ontology to capture information (e.g., location, attacker, target, weapon, start-time, and end-time, etc.) that dispatchers often collected from users regarding their incident tips. Applying the proposed ontology, we found that dispatchers often asked users for different information across varied event types (e.g., Attacker for Abuse and Attack events, Target for Harassment events). Additionally, using emotion detection and regression analysis, we found an inconsistency in dispatchers' emotional support and responsiveness to users' messages between different organizations and between incident categories. The results also showed that users had a higher response rate and responded quicker when dispatchers provided emotional support. These novel findings brought significant insights to both practitioners and system designers, e.g., AI-based solutions to augment human agents' skills for improved service quality. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, neural network based methods have shown their power in learning more expressive features on the task of knowledge graph embedding (KGE). However, the performance of deep methods often falls behind the shallow ones on simple graphs. One possible reason is that deep models are difficult to train, while shallow models might suffice for accurately representing the structure of the simple KGs. In this paper, we propose a neural network based model, named DeepE, to address the problem, which stacks multiple building blocks to predict the tail entity based on the head entity and the relation. Each building block is an addition of a linear and a non-linear function. The stacked building blocks are equivalent to a group of learning functions with different non-linear depth. Hence, DeepE allows deep functions to learn deep features, and shallow functions to learn shallow features. Through extensive experiments, we find DeepE outperforms other state-of-the-art baseline methods. A major advantage of DeepE is the robustness. DeepE achieves a Mean Rank (MR) score that is 6%, 30%, 65% lower than the best baseline methods on FB15k-237, WN18RR and YAGO3-10. Our design makes it possible to train much deeper networks on KGE, e.g. 40 layers on FB15k-237, and without scarifying precision on simple relations. ",

Despite the fact that the NN training is very complex for long polar codes, the NN decoding gives the better latency and its performance is potentially close to the maximum likelihood (ML). In this paper, we describe an efficient algorithm to create the NN decoding for a polar code of any size with the initial performance that is equal or better than that of successive cancelation (SC). Therefore, it creates an opportunity to design the NN based decoding with the performance that is as close to the ML, as the training time allows. ",

Streaming learning (i.e., learning from one data example at a time) has the potential to enable such real-time adaptation, but current approaches i) freeze a majority of network parameters during streaming and ii) are dependent upon offline, base initialization procedures over large subsets of data, which damages performance and limits applicability. To mitigate these shortcomings, we propose Cold Start Streaming Learning (CSSL), a simple, end-to-end approach for streaming learning with deep networks that uses a combination of replay and data augmentation to avoid catastrophic forgetting. Because CSSL updates all model parameters during streaming, the algorithm is capable of beginning streaming from a random initialization, making base initialization optional. Going further, the algorithm's simplicity allows theoretical convergence guarantees to be derived using analysis of the Neural Tangent Random Feature (NTRF). In experiments, we find that CSSL outperforms existing baselines for streaming learning in experiments on CIFAR100, ImageNet, and Core50 datasets. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-task streaming learning setting and show that CSSL performs favorably in this domain. Put simply, CSSL performs well and demonstrates that the complicated, multi-step training pipelines adopted by most streaming methodologies can be replaced with a simple, end-to-end learning approach without sacrificing performance.

The dominant form of data augmentation applies invariant transforms, where the learning target of a sample is invariant to the transform applied to that sample. We draw inspiration from human visual classification studies and propose generalizing augmentation with invariant transforms to soft augmentation where the learning target softens non-linearly as a function of the degree of the transform applied to the sample: e.g., more aggressive image crop augmentations produce less confident learning targets. We demonstrate that soft targets allow for more aggressive data augmentation, offer more robust performance boosts, work with other augmentation policies, and interestingly, produce better calibrated models (since they are trained to be less confident on aggressively cropped/occluded examples). Combined with existing aggressive augmentation strategies, soft target 1) doubles the top-1 accuracy boost across Cifar-10, Cifar-100, ImageNet-1K, and ImageNet-V2, 2) improves model occlusion performance by up to $4\\times$, and 3) halves the expected calibration error (ECE). Finally, we show that soft augmentation generalizes to self-supervised classification tasks. ",

Clustering attributed graphs requires joint modeling of graph structure and node attributes. Recent work has focused on graph convolutional networks and graph convolutional filters to combine structural and content information. However, these methods are mostly limited to lowpass filtering and do not explicitly optimize the filters for the clustering task. In this paper, we introduce a graph signal processing based approach, where we design polynomial graph filters optimized for clustering. The proposed approach is formulated as a two-step iterative optimization problem where graph filters that are interpretable and optimal for the given data are learned while maximizing the separation between different clusters. The proposed approach is evaluated on attributed networks and compared to the state-of-the-art graph convolutional network approaches. ",

The success of an ML application usually depends on the close collaboration of ML experts and domain experts. However, the shortage of ML engineers remains a fundamental problem. Low-code Machine learning tools/platforms (aka, AutoML) aim to democratize ML development to domain experts by automating many repetitive tasks in the ML pipeline. This research presents an empirical study of around 14k posts (questions + accepted answers) from Stack Overflow (SO) that contained AutoML-related discussions. We examine how these topics are spread across the various Machine Learning Life Cycle (MLLC) phases and their popularity and difficulty. This study offers several interesting findings. First, we find 13 AutoML topics that we group into four categories. The MLOps topic category (43% questions) is the largest, followed by Model (28% questions), Data (27% questions), Documentation (2% questions). Second, Most questions are asked during Model training (29%) (i.e., implementation phase) and Data preparation (25%) MLLC phase. Third, AutoML practitioners find the MLOps topic category most challenging, especially topics related to model deployment & monitoring and Automated ML pipeline. These findings have implications for all three AutoML stakeholders: AutoML researchers, AutoML service vendors, and AutoML developers. Academia and Industry collaboration can improve different aspects of AutoML, such as better DevOps/deployment support and tutorial-based documentation. ",

    "title": "Syntax-Aware On-the-Fly Code Completion",
    "abstract": "Code completion aims to help improve developers' productivity by suggesting the next code tokens from a given context. Various approaches have been proposed to incorporate abstract syntax tree (AST) information for model training, ensuring that code completion is aware of the syntax of the programming languages. However, existing syntax-aware code completion approaches are not on-the-fly, as we found that for every two-thirds of characters that developers type, AST fails to be extracted because it requires the syntactically correct source code, limiting its practicality in real-world scenarios. On the other hand, existing on-the-fly code completion does not consider syntactic information yet. In this paper, we propose PyCoder to leverage token types, a kind of lightweight syntactic information, which is readily available and aligns with the natural order of source code. Our PyCoder is trained in a multi-task training manner so that by learning the supporting task of predicting token types during the training phase, the models achieve better performance on predicting tokens and lines of code without the need for token types in the inference phase. Comprehensive experiments show that PyCoder achieves the first rank on the CodeXGLUE leaderboard with an accuracy of 77.12% for the token-level predictions, which is 0.43%-24.25% more accurate than baselines. In addition, PyCoder achieves an exact match of 43.37% for the line-level predictions, which is 3.63%-84.73% more accurate than baselines. These results lead us to conclude that token type information (an alternative to syntactic information) that is rarely used in the past can greatly improve the performance of code completion approaches, without requiring the syntactically correct source code like AST-based approaches do. Our PyCoder is publicly available on HuggingFace. ",

    "abstract": "It has been widely observed in the machine learning community that a small perturbation to the input can cause a large change in the prediction of a trained model, and such phenomena have been intensively studied in the machine learning community under the name of adversarial attacks. Because graph algorithms also are widely used for decision making and knowledge discovery, it is important to design graph algorithms that are robust against adversarial attacks. In this study, we consider the Lipschitz continuity of algorithms as a robustness measure and initiate a systematic study of the Lipschitz continuity of algorithms for (weighted) graph problems. Depending on how we embed the output solution to a metric space, we can think of several Lipschitzness notions. We mainly consider the one that is invariant under scaling of weights, and we provide Lipschitz continuous algorithms and lower bounds for the minimum spanning tree problem, the shortest path problem, and the maximum weight matching problem. In particular, our shortest path algorithm is obtained by first designing an algorithm for unweighted graphs that are robust against edge contractions and then applying it to the unweighted graph constructed from the original weighted graph. Then, we consider another Lipschitzness notion induced by a natural mapping that maps the output solution to its characteristic vector. It turns out that no Lipschitz continuous algorithm exists for this Lipschitz notion, and we instead design algorithms with bounded pointwise Lipschitz constants for the minimum spanning tree problem and the maximum weight bipartite matching problem. Our algorithm for the latter problem is based on an LP relaxation with entropy regularization. ",

To mitigate this gap, we propose an end-to-end deep explainable learning approach that combines the advantage of deep model in noise handling and expert rule-based interpretability. Specifically, we propose to learn a deep data assessing model which models the data as a graph to represent the correlations among different observations, whose output will be used to extract key data features. The key features are then fed into a rule network constructed following predefined noisy expert rules with trainable parameters. As these models are correlated, we propose an end-to-end training framework, utilizing the rule classification loss to optimize the rule learning model and data assessing model at the same time. As the rule-based computation is none-differentiable, we propose a gradient linking search module to carry the gradient information from the rule learning model to the data assessing model. The proposed method is tested in an industry production system, showing comparable prediction accuracy, much higher generalization stability and better interpretability when compared with a decent deep ensemble baseline, and shows much better fitting power than pure rule-based approach.

However, these methods are sensitive to outliers, which lead to more incorrect correspondences. In this paper, we propose a novel deep graph matching-based framework for point cloud registration. Specifically, we first transform point clouds into graphs and extract deep features for each point. Then, we develop a module based on deep graph matching to calculate a soft correspondence matrix. By using graph matching, not only the local geometry of each point but also its structure and topology in a larger range are considered in establishing correspondences, so that more correct correspondences are found. We train the network with a loss directly defined on the correspondences, and in the test stage the soft correspondences are transformed into hard one-to-one correspondences so that registration can be performed by a correspondence-based solver. Furthermore, we introduce a transformer-based method to generate edges for graph construction, which further improves the quality of the correspondences. Extensive experiments on object-level and scene-level benchmark datasets show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In this paper, we offer a novel medical diagnostic framework that employs a federated learning platform to ensure patient data privacy by transferring classification algorithms acquired in a labeled domain to a domain with sparse or missing labeled data. Rather than using a generative adversarial network, our framework uses a discriminative model to build multiple classification loss functions with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy. It also avoids the difficulty of collecting large amounts of labeled data or the high cost of generating large amount of sample data. Experiments on real-world image datasets demonstrates that the suggested adversarial federated transfer learning method is promising for real-world medical diagnosis applications that use image classification.

    "abstract": "Robust steganography is a technique of hiding secret messages in images so that the message can be recovered after additional image processing. One of the most popular processing operations is JPEG recompression. Unfortunately, most of today's steganographic methods addressing this issue only provide a probabilistic guarantee of recovering the secret and are consequently not errorless. That is unacceptable since even a single unexpected change can make the whole message unreadable if it is encrypted. We propose to create a robust set of DCT coefficients by inspecting their behavior during recompression, which requires access to the targeted JPEG compressor. This is done by dividing the DCT coefficients into 64 non-overlapping lattices because one embedding change can potentially affect many other coefficients from the same DCT block during recompression. The robustness is then combined with standard steganographic costs creating a lattice embedding scheme robust against JPEG recompression. Through experiments, we show that the size of the robust set and the scheme's security depends on the ordering of lattices during embedding. We verify the validity of the proposed method with three typical JPEG compressors and benchmark its security for various embedding payloads, three different ways of ordering the lattices, and a range of Quality Factors. Finally, this method is errorless by construction, meaning the embedded message will always be readable. ",

Deep learning methods have achieved good results in medical named entity recognition (NER). However, we find that existing methods face great challenges when dealing with the nested named entities. In this work, we propose a novel method, referred to as ASAC, to solve the dilemma caused by the nested phenomenon, in which the core idea is to model the dependency between different categories of entity recognition. The proposed method contains two key modules: the adaptive shared (AS) part and the attentive conditional random field (ACRF) module. The former part automatically assigns adaptive weights across each task to achieve optimal recognition accuracy in the multi-layer network. The latter module employs the attention operation to model the dependency between different entities. In this way, our model could learn better entity representations by capturing the implicit distinctions and relationships between different categories of entities. Extensive experiments on public datasets verify the effectiveness of our method. Besides, we also perform ablation analyses to deeply understand our methods. ",

Relationship can sometimes be non-mutually exclusive, which can be described from multiple perspectives like geometrical relationships or semantic relationships, making it even more challenging to predict the most suitable relationship label. In this work, we proposed the SG-Shuffle pipeline for scene graph generation with 3 components: 1) Parallel Transformer Encoder, which learns to predict object relationships in a more exclusive manner by grouping relationship labels into groups of similar purpose; 2) Shuffle Transformer, which learns to select the final relationship labels from the category-specific feature generated in the previous step; and 3) Weighted CE loss, used to alleviate the training bias caused by the imbalanced dataset.

The basic assumption of PLL is that the ground-truth label must reside in the candidate set. However, this assumption may not be satisfied due to the unprofessional judgment of the annotators, thus limiting the practical application of PLL. In this paper, we relax this assumption and focus on a more general problem, noisy PLL, where the ground-truth label may not exist in the candidate set. To address this challenging problem, we further propose a novel framework called \"Automatic Refinement Network (ARNet)\". Our method consists of multiple rounds. In each round, we purify the noisy samples through two key modules, i.e., noisy sample detection and label correction. To guarantee the performance of these modules, we start with warm-up training and automatically select the appropriate correction epoch. Meanwhile, we exploit data augmentation to further reduce prediction errors in ARNet. Through theoretical analysis, we prove that our method is able to reduce the noise level of the dataset and eventually approximate the Bayes optimal classifier. To verify the effectiveness of ARNet, we conduct experiments on multiple benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our ARNet is superior to existing state-of-the-art approaches in noisy PLL. Our code will be made public soon. ",

Since high bit-depth is an emerging technology, video content is still largely shot and transmitted with a bit depth of 8 bits or less per color component. Insufficient bit-depths produce distortions called false contours or banding, and they are visible on high contrast screens. To deal with such distortions, researchers have proposed algorithms for bit-depth enhancement (dequantization). Such techniques convert videos with low bit-depth (LBD) to videos with high bit-depth (HBD). The quality of converted LBD video, however, is usually lower than that of the original HBD video, and many consumers prefer to keep the original HBD versions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to determine whether a video has undergone conversion before compression. This problem is complex; it involves detecting outcomes of different dequantization algorithms in the presence of compression that strongly affects the least-significant bits (LSBs) in the video frames. Our algorithm can detect bit-depth enhancement and demonstrates good generalization capability, as it is able to determine whether a video has undergone processing by dequantization algorithms absent from the training dataset.

In this paper, we propose 3DFill, a simple and efficient method for reference-guided image inpainting. Given a target image with arbitrary hole regions and a reference image from another viewpoint, the 3DFill first aligns the two images by a two-stage method: 3D projection + 2D transformation, which has better results than 2D image alignment. The 3D projection is an overall alignment between images and the 2D transformation is a local alignment focused on the hole region. The entire process of image alignment is self-supervised. We then fill the hole in the target image with the contents of the aligned image. Finally, we use a conditional generation network to refine the filled image to obtain the inpainting result. 3DFill achieves state-of-the-art performance on image inpainting across a variety of wide view shifts and has a faster inference speed than other inpainting models.

Kitaev (2016) showed that if $u$ is of length at least 3, then every graph is $u$-representable. This indicates that there are only two nontrivial classes in the theory of $u$-representable graphs: 11-representable graphs, which correspond to word-representable graphs, and 12-representable graphs. This study deals with 12-representable graphs. Jones et al. (2015) provided a characterization of 12-representable trees in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs. Chen and Kitaev (2022) presented a forbidden induced subgraph characterization of a subclass of 12-representable grid graphs. This paper shows that a bipartite graph is 12-representable if and only if it is an interval containment bigraph. The equivalence gives us a forbidden induced subgraph characterization of 12-representable bipartite graphs since the list of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs is known for interval containment bigraphs. We then have a forbidden induced subgraph characterization for grid graphs, which solves an open problem of Chen and Kitaev (2022). The study also shows that a graph is 12-representable if and only if it is the complement of a simple-triangle graph. This equivalence indicates that a necessary condition for 12-representability presented by Jones et al. (2015) is also sufficient. Finally, we show from these equivalences that 12-representability can be determined in $O(n^2)$ time for bipartite graphs and in $O(n(\\bar{m}+n))$ time for arbitrary graphs, where $n$ and $\\bar{m}$ are the number of vertices and edges of the complement of the given graph.

However, the unsupervised mechanism depends on a well designed loss function, which cannot guarantee that all vital information of source images is sufficiently extracted. In this work, we propose a novel interactive feature embedding in self-supervised learning framework for infrared and visible image fusion, attempting to overcome the issue of vital information degradation. With the help of self-supervised learning framework, hierarchical representations of source images can be efficiently extracted. In particular, interactive feature embedding models are tactfully designed to build a bridge between the self-supervised learning and infrared and visible image fusion learning, achieving vital information retention. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations exhibit that the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. ",

Recently, it has been shown that involving the time dimension when designing augmentations can be superior to its spatial-only variants for video action recognition. In this paper, we propose several novel enhancements to these techniques to strengthen the relationship between the spatial and temporal domains and achieve a deeper level of perturbations.

However, most previous works assumed that each view is complete and aligned. This leads to an inevitable deterioration in their performance when encountering practical problems such as missing or unaligned views. To address the challenge of representation learning on partially aligned multi-view data, we propose a new cross-view graph contrastive learning framework, which integrates multi-view information to align data and learn latent representations. Compared with current approaches, the proposed method has the following merits: (1) our model is an end-to-end framework that simultaneously performs view-specific representation learning via view-specific autoencoders and cluster-level data aligning by combining multi-view information with the cross-view graph contrastive learning; (2) it is easy to apply our model to explore information from three or more modalities/sources as the cross-view graph contrastive learning is devised. Extensive experiments conducted on several real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the clustering and classification tasks. ",

A large number of these attacks could be prevented if the network operators were better equipped with threat intelligence information that would allow them to block or throttle nefarious scanning activities. Network telescopes or \"darknets\" offer a unique window into observing Internet-wide scanners and other malicious entities, and they could offer early warning signals to operators that would be critical for infrastructure protection and/or attack mitigation. A network telescope consists of unused or \"dark\" IP spaces that serve no users, and solely passively observes any Internet traffic destined to the \"telescope sensor\" in an attempt to record ubiquitous network scanners, malware that forage for vulnerable devices, and other dubious activities. Hence, monitoring network telescopes for timely detection of coordinated and heavy scanning activities is an important, albeit challenging, task. The challenges mainly arise due to the non-stationarity and the dynamic nature of Internet traffic and, more importantly, the fact that one needs to monitor high-dimensional signals (e.g., all TCP/UDP ports) to search for \"sparse\" anomalies. We propose statistical methods to address both challenges in an efficient and \"online\" manner; our work is validated both with synthetic data as well as real-world data from a large network telescope.

We study the question under which conditions the marginals $\\rho$ can be decomposed into a probability distribution on the subsets of $E$ such that the resulting random set intersects each $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$ with probability at least $\\pi_P$. Extending a result by Dahan, Amin, and Jaillet (MOR 2022) motivated by a network security game in directed acyclic graphs, we show that such a distribution exists if $\\mathcal{P}$ is an abstract network and the requirements are of the form $\\pi_P = 1 - \\sum_{e \\in P} \\mu_e$ for some $\\mu \\in [0, 1]^E$. Our proof yields an explicit description of a feasible distribution that can be computed efficiently. As a consequence, equilibria for the security game studied by Dahan et al. can be efficiently computed even when the underlying digraph contains cycles. As a subroutine of our algorithm, we provide a combinatorial algorithm for computing shortest paths in abstract networks, answering an open question by McCormick (SODA 1996). We further show that a conservation law proposed by Dahan et al. for requirement functions in partially ordered sets can be reduced to the setting of affine requirements described above. ",

The heterogeneous clinical profile of MDD means that any given speech, facial expression and/or observed cognitive pattern may be associated with a unique combination of depressive symptoms. Conventional discriminative machine learning models potentially lack the complexity to robustly model this heterogeneity. Bayesian networks, however, may instead be well-suited to such a scenario. These networks are probabilistic graphical models that efficiently describe the joint probability distribution over a set of random variables by explicitly capturing their conditional dependencies. This framework provides further advantages over standard discriminative modelling by offering the possibility to incorporate expert opinion in the graphical structure of the models, generating explainable model predictions, informing about the uncertainty of predictions, and naturally handling missing data. In this study, we apply a Bayesian framework to capture the relationships between depression, depression symptoms, and features derived from speech, facial expression and cognitive game data collected at thymia.

However, these models exhibit a performance bottleneck in the online query encoding step, as the corresponding query encoders are usually large and complex Transformer models. In this paper we investigate heterogeneous dual-encoder models, where the two encoders are separate models that do not share parameters or initializations. We empirically show that heterogeneous dual-encoders are susceptible to collapsing representations, causing them to output constant trivial representations when they are fine-tuned using a standard contrastive loss due to a distribution mismatch. We propose DAFT, a simple two-stage fine-tuning approach that aligns the two encoders in order to prevent them from collapsing. We further demonstrate how DAFT can be used to train efficient heterogeneous dual-encoder models using lightweight query encoders. ",

They are deployed in an increasing number of applications where they often operate as black boxes that do not provide explanations for their predictions. Among others, the potential harms associated with the lack of understanding of the models' rationales include privacy violations, adversarial manipulations, and unfair discrimination. As a result, the accountability and transparency of ML models have been posed as critical desiderata by works in policy and law, philosophy, and computer science. In computer science, the decision-making process of ML models has been studied by developing accountability and transparency methods. Accountability methods, such as adversarial attacks and diagnostic datasets, expose vulnerabilities of ML models that could lead to malicious manipulations or systematic faults in their predictions. Transparency methods explain the rationales behind models' predictions gaining the trust of relevant stakeholders and potentially uncovering mistakes and unfairness in models' decisions. To this end, transparency methods have to meet accountability requirements as well, e.g., being robust and faithful to the underlying rationales of a model. This thesis presents my research that expands our collective knowledge in the areas of accountability and transparency of ML models developed for complex reasoning tasks over text. ",

Typically, readouts are simple and non-adaptive functions designed such that the resulting hypothesis space is permutation invariant. Prior work on deep sets indicates that such readouts might require complex node embeddings that can be difficult to learn via standard neighborhood aggregation schemes. Motivated by this, we investigate the potential of adaptive readouts given by neural networks that do not necessarily give rise to permutation invariant hypothesis spaces. We argue that in some problems such as binding affinity prediction where molecules are typically presented in a canonical form it might be possible to relax the constraints on permutation invariance of the hypothesis space and learn a more effective model of the affinity by employing an adaptive readout function. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of neural readouts on more than 40 datasets spanning different domains and graph characteristics. Moreover, we observe a consistent improvement over standard readouts (i.e., sum, max, and mean) relative to the number of neighborhood aggregation iterations and different convolutional operators. ",

Specifically, we will explore how to support learners with adaptive visualisations through a two-pronged approach: (1) by designing adaptive visualisations based on the proficiency of the learner to support regular piano playing and (2) by assisting them with expert annotations projected on the piano to encourage improvisation. To this end, we will build a model to understand the complexities of learners' spatiotemporal data and use these to support learning. We will then evaluate our approach through user studies enabling practice and improvisation. Our work contributes to how adaptive visualisations can push music instrument learning and support multi-target selection tasks in immersive spaces. ",

Despite significant progress, subscribers to the former miss out on useful degradation information that could be used to improve the SR process. On the other hand, followers of the latter rely on weaker SR networks, which are significantly outperformed by the latest architectural advancements. In this work, we present a framework for combining any blind SR prediction mechanism with any deep SR network, using a metadata insertion block to insert prediction vectors into SR network feature maps. Through comprehensive testing, we prove that state-of-the-art contrastive and iterative prediction schemes can be successfully combined with high-performance SR networks such as RCAN and HAN within our framework. We show that our hybrid models consistently achieve stronger SR performance than both their non-blind and blind counterparts. Furthermore, we demonstrate our framework's robustness by predicting degradations and super-resolving images from a complex pipeline of blurring, noise and compression. ",

In the medical field, there exists a variety of labels for data that serve different purposes at different stages of a diagnostic and treatment process. Clinical labels and biomarker labels are two examples. In general, clinical labels are easier to obtain in larger quantities because they are regularly collected during routine clinical care, while biomarker labels require expert analysis and interpretation to obtain. Within the field of ophthalmology, previous work has shown that clinical values exhibit correlations with biomarker structures that manifest within optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans. We exploit this relationship between clinical and biomarker data to improve performance for biomarker classification. This is accomplished by leveraging the larger amount of clinical data as pseudo-labels for our data without biomarker labels in order to choose positive and negative instances for training a backbone network with a supervised contrastive loss. In this way, a backbone network learns a representation space that aligns with the clinical data distribution available. Afterwards, we fine-tune the network trained in this manner with the smaller amount of biomarker labeled data with a cross-entropy loss in order to classify these key indicators of disease directly from OCT scans. Our method is shown to outperform state of the art self-supervised methods by as much as 5% in terms of accuracy on individual biomarker detection. ",

    "abstract": "In this short technical note we propose a baseline for decision-aware learning for contextual linear optimization, which solves stochastic linear optimization when cost coefficients can be predicted based on context information. We propose a decision-aware version of predict-then-optimize. We reweigh the prediction error by the decision regret incurred by an (unweighted) pilot estimator of costs to obtain a decision-aware predictor, then optimize with cost predictions from the decision-aware predictor. This method can be motivated as a finite-difference, iterate-independent approximation of the gradients of previously proposed end-to-end learning algorithms; it is also consistent with previously suggested intuition for end-to-end learning. This baseline is computationally easy to implement with readily available reweighted prediction oracles and linear optimization, and can be implemented with convex optimization so long as the prediction error minimization is convex. Empirically, we demonstrate that this approach can lead to improvements over a \"predict-then-optimize\" framework for settings with misspecified models, and is competitive with other end-to-end approaches. Therefore, due to its simplicity and ease of use, we suggest it as a simple baseline for end-to-end and decision-aware learning. ",

    "abstract": "To deploy the airframe digital twin or to conduct probabilistic evaluations of the remaining life of a structural component, a (near) real-time crack-growth simulation method is critical. In this paper, a reduced-order simulation approach is developed to achieve this goal by leveraging two methods. On the one hand, the symmetric Galerkin boundary element method - finite element method (SGBEM-FEM) coupling method is combined with parametric modeling to generate the database of computed stress intensity factors for cracks with various sizes/shapes in a complex structural component, by which hundreds of samples are automatically simulated within a day. On the other hand, machine learning methods are applied to establish the relation between crack sizes/shapes and crack-front stress intensity factors. By combining the reduced-order computational model with load inputs and fatigue growth laws, a real-time prediction of probabilistic crack growth in complex structures with minimum computational burden is realized. In an example of a round-robin helicopter component, even though the fatigue crack growth is simulated cycle by cycle, the simulation is faster than real-time (as compared with the physical test). The proposed approach is a key simulation technology toward realizing the digital twin of complex structures, which further requires fusion of model predictions with flight/inspection/monitoring data.

    "abstract": "Virtual, make-on-demand chemical libraries have transformed early-stage drug discovery by unlocking vast, synthetically accessible regions of chemical space. Recent years have witnessed rapid growth in these libraries from millions to trillions of compounds, hiding undiscovered, potent hits for a variety of therapeutic targets. However, they are quickly approaching a size beyond that which permits explicit enumeration, presenting new challenges for virtual screening. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Combinatorial Synthesis Library Variational Auto-Encoder (CSLVAE). The proposed generative model represents such libraries as a differentiable, hierarchically-organized database. Given a compound from the library, the molecular encoder constructs a query for retrieval, which is utilized by the molecular decoder to reconstruct the compound by first decoding its chemical reaction and subsequently decoding its reactants. Our design minimizes autoregression in the decoder, facilitating the generation of large, valid molecular graphs. Our method performs fast and parallel batch inference for ultra-large synthesis libraries, enabling a number of important applications in early-stage drug discovery. Compounds proposed by our method are guaranteed to be in the library, and thus synthetically and cost-effectively accessible. Importantly, CSLVAE can encode out-of-library compounds and search for in-library analogues. In experiments, we demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method in the navigation of massive combinatorial synthesis libraries. ",

    "abstract": "Predictive simulations of the shock-to-detonation transition (SDT) in heterogeneous energetic materials (EM) are vital to the design and control of their energy release and sensitivity. Due to the complexity of the thermo-mechanics of EM during the SDT, both macro-scale response and sub-grid mesoscale energy localization must be captured accurately. This work proposes an efficient and accurate multiscale framework for SDT simulations of EM. We employ deep learning to model the mesoscale energy localization of shock-initiated EM microstructures upon which prediction results are used to supply reaction progress rate information to the macroscale SDT simulation. The proposed multiscale modeling framework is divided into two stages. First, a physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural network (PARC) is used to model the mesoscale energy localization of shock-initiated heterogeneous EM microstructures. PARC is trained using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of hotspot ignition and growth within microstructures of pressed HMX material subjected to different input shock strengths. After training, PARC is employed to supply hotspot ignition and growth rates for macroscale SDT simulations. We show that PARC can play the role of a surrogate model in a multiscale simulation framework, while drastically reducing the computation cost and providing improved representations of the sub-grid physics. The proposed multiscale modeling approach will provide a new tool for material scientists in designing high-performance and safer energetic materials. ",

Automated diagnosis systems, with the advancement of machine learning algorithms, have the potential to accelerate the classification process, alert patients, and support physicians in making quick and accurate decisions. In this paper, we present a novel multi-path seizure-type classification deep learning network (MP-SeizNet), consisting of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network (Bi-LSTM) with an attention mechanism. The objective of this study was to classify specific types of seizures, including complex partial, simple partial, absence, tonic, and tonic-clonic seizures, using only electroencephalogram (EEG) data. The EEG data is fed to our proposed model in two different representations. The CNN was fed with wavelet-based features extracted from the EEG signals, while the Bi-LSTM was fed with raw EEG signals to let our MP-SeizNet jointly learns from different representations of seizure data for more accurate information learning. The proposed MP-SeizNet was evaluated using the largest available EEG epilepsy database, the Temple University Hospital EEG Seizure Corpus, TUSZ v1.5.2. We evaluated our proposed model across different patient data using three-fold cross-validation and across seizure data using five-fold cross-validation, achieving F1 scores of 87.6% and 98.1%, respectively.

This work investigates the capabilities of two DL approaches to assess cancer cellularity in whole slide images (WSI) in the SPIE-AAPM-NCI BreastPathQ challenge dataset. The effects of training on augmented data via rotations, and combinations of multiple architectures into a single network were analyzed using a modified Kendall Tau-b prediction probability metric known as the average prediction probability PK. A deep, transfer learned, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) InceptionV3 was used as a baseline, achieving an average PK value of 0.884, showing improvement from the average PK value of 0.83 achieved by pathologists. The network was then trained on additional training datasets which were rotated between 1 and 360 degrees, which saw a peak increase of PK up to 4.2%. An additional architecture consisting of the InceptionV3 network and VGG16, a shallow, transfer learned CNN, was combined in a parallel architecture. This parallel architecture achieved a baseline average PK value of 0.907, a statistically significantly improvement over either of the architectures' performances separately (p<0.0001 by unpaired t-test).

We propose a deep-learning framework, trained by radiologists' supervision, for automating FOV prescription. An intra-stack shared feature extraction network and an attention network are used to process a stack of 2D image inputs to generate output scalars defining the location of a rectangular region of interest (ROI). The attention mechanism is used to make the model focus on the small number of informative slices in a stack. Then the smallest FOV that makes the neural network predicted ROI free of aliasing is calculated by an algebraic operation derived from MR sampling theory. We retrospectively collected 595 cases between February 2018 and February 2022. The framework's performance is examined quantitatively with intersection over union (IoU) and pixel error on position, and qualitatively with a reader study. We use the t-test for comparing quantitative results from all models and a radiologist. The proposed model achieves an average IoU of 0.867 and average ROI position error of 9.06 out of 512 pixels on 80 test cases, significantly better (P<0.05) than two baseline models and not significantly different from a radiologist (P>0.12).

As an immediate consequence, this shows that all upward outerplanar graphs have constant stack number, answering a question by Bhore et al.

In this paper, we investigate the use of SNNs in the context of channel equalization for ultra-low complexity receivers. We propose an SNN-based equalizer with a feedback structure akin to the decision feedback equalizer (DFE). For conversion of real-world data into spike signals we introduce a novel ternary encoding and compare it with traditional log-scale encoding. We show that our approach clearly outperforms conventional linear equalizers for three different exemplary channels. We highlight that mainly the conversion of the channel output to spikes introduces a small performance penalty.

A set $M$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is distance-edge-monitoring set if every edge $e$ of $G$ is monitored by some vertex of $M$, that is, the set $P(M, e)$ is nonempty.

The vertices of $M$ represent distance probes in a network modeled by $G$; when the edge $e$ fails, the distance from $x$ to $y$ increases, and thus we are able to detect the failure. It turns out that not only we can detect it, but we can even correctly locate the failing edge. In this paper, we continue the study of \\emph{distance-edge-monitoring sets}. In particular, we give upper and lower bounds of $P(M,e)$, $EM(x)$, $dem(G)$, respectively, and extremal graphs attaining the bounds are characterized.

These streets are often represented as graphs where intersections are modelled as nodes and streets as links between them. Previous work has shown that raster representations of the original data can be created through a learning algorithm on low-dimensional representations of the street networks. In contrast, models that capture high-level urban network metrics can be trained through convolutional neural networks. However, the detailed topological data is lost through the rasterisation of the street network. The models cannot recover this information from the image alone, failing to capture complex street network features. This paper proposes a model capable of inferring good representations directly from the street network. Specifically, we use a variational autoencoder with graph convolutional layers and a decoder that outputs a probabilistic fully-connected graph to learn latent representations that encode both local network structure and the spatial distribution of nodes. We train the model on thousands of street network segments and use the learnt representations to generate synthetic street configurations. Finally, we proposed a possible application to classify the urban morphology of different network segments by investigating their common characteristics in the learnt space. ",

We show that this can be solved by using the more general Reproducing Kernel Banach spaces (RKBS). This class of integral RKBS can be understood as an infinite union of RKHS spaces. As the RKBS is not a Hilbert space, it is not its own dual space. However, we show that its dual space is again an RKBS where the roles of the data and parameters are interchanged, forming an adjoint pair of RKBSs including a reproducing property in the dual space.

Despite many seminal contributions in the field, we still have a poor understanding of the interplay between the network architecture and the choice of data augmentation. Moreover, only a handful of studies demonstrate the generalizability of a particular model across multiple datasets, which is a prerequisite for robust real-world performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of popular deep learning approaches for emotion recognition. To eliminate bias, we fix the model architectures and optimization hyperparameters using the VESUS dataset and then use repeated 5-fold cross validation to evaluate the performance on the IEMOCAP and CREMA-D datasets. Our results demonstrate that long-range dependencies in the speech signal are critical for emotion recognition and that speed/rate augmentation offers the most robust performance gain across models.
