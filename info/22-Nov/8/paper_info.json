    "title": "Wind Power Forecasting Considering Data Privacy Protection: A Federated  Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach",
    "abstract": "In a modern power system with an increasing proportion of renewable energy, wind power prediction is crucial to the arrangement of power grid dispatching plans due to the volatility of wind power. However, traditional centralized forecasting methods raise concerns regarding data privacy-preserving and data islands problem. To handle the data privacy and openness, we propose a forecasting scheme that combines federated learning and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting, called federated deep reinforcement learning (FedDRL). Firstly, this paper uses the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm as the basic forecasting model to improve prediction accuracy. Secondly, we integrate the DDPG forecasting model into the framework of federated learning. The designed FedDRL can obtain an accurate prediction model in a decentralized way by sharing model parameters instead of sharing private data which can avoid sensitive privacy issues. The simulation results show that the proposed FedDRL outperforms the traditional prediction methods in terms of forecasting accuracy. More importantly, while ensuring the forecasting performance, FedDRL can effectively protect the data privacy and relieve the communication pressure compared with the traditional centralized forecasting method. In addition, a simulation with different federated learning parameters is conducted to confirm the robustness of the proposed scheme. ",

Specifically, we study the graph produced when an input traverses all the layers of a NN, and show that such graphs are different for clean and adversarial inputs. We find that graphs from clean inputs are more centralized around highway edges, whereas those from adversaries are more diffuse, leveraging under-optimized edges. Through experiments on a variety of datasets and architectures, we show that these under-optimized edges are a source of adversarial vulnerability and that they can be used to detect adversarial inputs.

    "abstract": "Channel Attention reigns supreme as an effective technique in the field of computer vision. However, the proposed channel attention by SENet suffers from information loss in feature learning caused by the use of Global Average Pooling (GAP) to represent channels as scalars. Thus, designing effective channel attention mechanisms requires finding a solution to enhance features preservation in modeling channel inter-dependencies. In this work, we utilize Wavelet transform compression as a solution to the channel representation problem. We first test wavelet transform as an Auto-Encoder model equipped with conventional channel attention module. Next, we test wavelet transform as a standalone channel compression method. We prove that global average pooling is equivalent to the recursive approximate Haar wavelet transform. With this proof, we generalize channel attention using Wavelet compression and name it WaveNet. Implementation of our method can be embedded within existing channel attention methods with a couple of lines of code. We test our proposed method using ImageNet dataset for image classification task. Our method outperforms the baseline SENet, and achieves the state-of-the-art results.

Using traditional planning models, computer scientists have attempted to replicate this capacity with some level of success but ultimately face a reoccurring limitation: as the plan grows in steps, the number of different possible futures makes it intractable to determine the right sequence of actions to reach a goal state. Based on prior theoretical work on how the ecology of an animal governs the value of spatial planning, we developed a more efficient biologically-inspired planning algorithm, TLPPO. This algorithm allows us to achieve mouselevel predator evasion performance with orders of magnitude less computation than a widespread algorithm for planning in the situations of partial observability that typify predator-prey interactions. We compared the performance of a real-time agent using TLPPO against the performance of live mice, all tasked with evading a robot predator. We anticipate these results will be helpful to planning algorithm users and developers, as well as to areas of neuroscience where robot-animal interaction can provide a useful approach to studying the basis of complex behaviors.

    "abstract": "A software requirement specification (SRS) document is an essential part of the software development life cycle which outlines the requirements that a software program in development must satisfy. This document is often specified by a diverse group of stakeholders and is subject to continual change, making the process of maintaining the document and detecting conflicts between requirements an essential task in software development. Notably, projects that do not address conflicts in the SRS document early on face considerable problems later in the development life cycle. These problems incur substantial costs in terms of time and money, and these costs often become insurmountable barriers that ultimately result in the termination of a software project altogether. As a result, early detection of SRS conflicts is critical to project sustainability. The conflict detection task is approached in numerous ways, many of which require a significant amount of manual intervention from developers, or require access to a large amount of labeled, task-specific training data. In this work, we propose using a prompt-based learning approach to perform few-shot learning for conflict detection. We compare our results to supervised learning approaches that use pretrained language models, such as BERT and its variants. Our results show that prompting with just 32 labeled examples can achieve a similar level of performance in many key metrics to that of supervised learning on training sets that are magnitudes larger in size. In contrast to many other conflict detection approaches, we make no assumptions about the type of underlying requirements, allowing us to analyze pairings of both functional and non-functional requirements. This allows us to omit the potentially expensive task of filtering out non-functional requirements from our dataset. ",

This is in contrast to the widely believed conjecture that the actual clique number of the Paley graph is $O(\\mathrm{polylog}(p))$. Our result may be viewed as a derandomization of that of Deshpande and Montanari (2015), who showed the same lower bound (up to $\\mathrm{polylog}(p)$ terms) with high probability for the Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi random graph on $p$ vertices, whose clique number is with high probability $O(\\log(p))$. We also show that our lower bound is optimal for the Feige-Krauthgamer construction of pseudomoments, derandomizing an argument of Kelner. Finally, we present numerical experiments indicating that the value of the degree 4 SOS relaxation of the Paley graph may scale as $O(p^{1/2 - \\epsilon})$ for some $\\epsilon > 0$, and give a matrix norm calculation indicating that the pseudocalibration proof strategy for SOS lower bounds for random graphs will not immediately transfer to the Paley graph. Taken together, our results suggest that degree 4 SOS may break the \"$\\sqrt{p}$ barrier\" for upper bounds on the clique number of Paley graphs, but prove that it can at best improve the exponent from $1/2$ to $1/3$.

    "abstract": "We initiate a systematic study of approximation schemes for fundamental optimization problems on disk graphs, a common generalization of both planar graphs and unit-disk graphs. Our main contribution is a general framework for designing efficient polynomial-time approximation schemes (EPTASes) for vertex-deletion problems on disk graphs, which results in EPTASes for many problems including Vertex Cover, Feedback Vertex Set, Small Cycle Hitting (in particular, Triangle Hitting), $P_k$-Hitting for $k\\in\\{3,4,5\\}$, Path Deletion, Pathwidth $1$-Deletion, Component Order Connectivity, Bounded Degree Deletion, Pseudoforest Deletion, Finite-Type Component Deletion, etc. All EPTASes obtained using our framework are robust in the sense that they do not require a realization of the input graph. To the best of our knowledge, prior to this work, the only problems known to admit (E)PTASes on disk graphs are Maximum Clique, Independent Set, Dominating set, and Vertex Cover, among which the existing PTAS [Erlebach et al., SICOMP'05] and EPTAS [Leeuwen, SWAT'06] for Vertex Cover require a realization of the input disk graph (while ours does not). The core of our framework is a reduction for a broad class of (approximation) vertex-deletion problems from (general) disk graphs to disk graphs of bounded local radius, which is a new invariant of disk graphs introduced in this work. Disk graphs of bounded local radius can be viewed as a mild generalization of planar graphs, which preserves certain nice properties of planar graphs. Specifically, we prove that disk graphs of bounded local radius admit the Excluded Grid Minor property and have locally bounded treewidth. This allows existing techniques for designing approximation schemes on planar graphs (e.g., bidimensionality and Baker's technique) to be directly applied to disk graphs of bounded local radius. ",

    "abstract": "The process of screening molecules for desirable properties is a key step in several applications, ranging from drug discovery to material design. During the process of drug discovery specifically, protein-ligand docking, or chemical docking, is a standard in-silico scoring technique that estimates the binding affinity of molecules with a specific protein target. Recently, however, as the number of virtual molecules available to test has rapidly grown, these classical docking algorithms have created a significant computational bottleneck. We address this problem by introducing Deep Surrogate Docking (DSD), a framework that applies deep learning-based surrogate modeling to accelerate the docking process substantially. DSD can be interpreted as a formalism of several earlier surrogate prefiltering techniques, adding novel metrics and practical training practices. Specifically, we show that graph neural networks (GNNs) can serve as fast and accurate estimators of classical docking algorithms. Additionally, we introduce FiLMv2, a novel GNN architecture which we show outperforms existing state-of-the-art GNN architectures, attaining more accurate and stable performance by allowing the model to filter out irrelevant information from data more efficiently. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we show that the DSD workflow combined with the FiLMv2 architecture provides a 9.496x speedup in molecule screening with a <3% recall error rate on an example docking task.

Pre-trained and fine-tuned language models have shown promise in these tasks although these models ignore the intrinsic information encoded in the knowledge graph, namely the entity and relation types. In this work, we propose the Knowledge Graph Language Model (KGLM) architecture, where we introduce a new entity/relation embedding layer that learns to differentiate distinctive entity and relation types, therefore allowing the model to learn the structure of the knowledge graph. In this work, we show that further pre-training the language models with this additional embedding layer using the triples extracted from the knowledge graph, followed by the standard fine-tuning phase sets a new state-of-the-art performance for the link prediction task on the benchmark datasets.

By taking a Bayesian approach, it is possible to reason about the uncertainty of the causal model. The notion of modelling the uncertainty over models is particularly crucial for causal structure learning since the model could be unidentifiable when given only a finite amount of observational data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to jointly learn the structure and mechanisms of the causal model using Variational Bayes, which we call Variational Bayes-DAG-GFlowNet (VBG). We extend the method of Bayesian causal structure learning using GFlowNets to learn not only the posterior distribution over the structure, but also the parameters of a linear-Gaussian model. Our results on simulated data suggest that VBG is competitive against several baselines in modelling the posterior over DAGs and mechanisms, while offering several advantages over existing methods, including the guarantee to sample acyclic graphs, and the flexibility to generalize to non-linear causal mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Recently, Neural architecture search has achieved great success on classification tasks for mobile devices. The backbone network for object detection is usually obtained on the image classification task. However, the architecture which is searched through the classification task is sub-optimal because of the gap between the task of image and object detection. As while work focuses on backbone network architecture search for mobile device object detection is limited, mainly because the backbone always requires expensive ImageNet pre-training. Accordingly, it is necessary to study the approach of network architecture search for mobile device object detection without expensive pre-training. In this work, we propose a mobile object detection backbone network architecture search algorithm which is a kind of evolutionary optimized method based on non-dominated sorting for NAS scenarios. It can quickly search to obtain the backbone network architecture within certain constraints. It better solves the problem of suboptimal linear combination accuracy and computational cost. The proposed approach can search the backbone networks with different depths, widths, or expansion sizes via a technique of weight mapping, making it possible to use NAS for mobile devices detection tasks a lot more efficiently. In our experiments, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach on YoloX-Lite, a lightweight version of the target detection framework. Under similar computational complexity, the accuracy of the backbone network architecture we search for is 2.0% mAP higher than MobileDet. Our improved backbone network can reduce the computational effort while improving the accuracy of the object detection network. To prove its effectiveness, a series of ablation studies have been carried out and the working mechanism has been analyzed in detail. ",

Such variation is not directly accessible and therefore simulated by data augmentations. However, commonly adopted augmentations are handcrafted and limited to simple geometrical and color changes, which are unable to cover the abundant intra-class variation. In this paper, we propose to extract the underlying data variation from datasets and construct a novel augmentation operator, named local manifold augmentation (LMA). LMA is achieved by training an instance-conditioned generator to fit the distribution on the local manifold of data and sampling multiview data using it. LMA shows the ability to create an infinite number of data views, preserve semantics, and simulate complicated variations in object pose, viewpoint, lighting condition, background etc. Experiments show that with LMA integrated, self-supervised learning methods such as MoCov2 and SimSiam gain consistent improvement on prevalent benchmarks including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, ImageNet100, and ImageNet. Furthermore, LMA leads to representations that obtain more significant invariance to the viewpoint, object pose, and illumination changes and stronger robustness to various real distribution shifts reflected by ImageNet-V2, ImageNet-R, ImageNet Sketch etc. ",

We highlight two major flaws in existing datasets that favor embedding-based entity alignment techniques, i.e., the isomorphic graph structures in relation triples and the weak heterogeneity in attribute triples. Towards a critical evaluation of embedding-based entity alignment methods, we construct a new dataset with heterogeneous relations and attributes based on event-centric KGs. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate existing popular methods, and find that they fail to achieve promising performance. As a new approach to this difficult problem, we propose a time-aware literal encoder for entity alignment. The dataset and source code are publicly available to foster future research.

In particular, we firstly evaluate different low complexity and benchmark deep neural networks: MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2, NASNetMobile, and EfficientNetB0, which present the number of trainable parameters lower than 5 Million (M). After indicating best network architecture, we further improve the network performance by applying attention schemes to multiple feature maps extracted from middle layers of the network. To deal with the issue of increasing the model footprint as using attention schemes, we apply the quantization technique to satisfies the number trainable parameter of the model lower than 5 M. By conducting extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets NWPU-RESISC45, we achieve a robust and low-complexity model, which is very competitive to the state-of-the-art systems and potential for real-life applications on edge devices.

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with on-board cameras are widely used for remote surveillance and video capturing applications. In remote virtual reality (VR) applications, multiple UAVs can be used to capture different partially overlapping angles of the ground target, which can be stitched together to provide 360{\\deg} views. This requires coordinated formation of UAVs that is adaptive to movements of the ground target. In this paper, we propose a joint UAV formation and tracking framework to capture 360{\\deg} angles of the target. The proposed framework uses a zero touch approach for automated and adaptive reconfiguration of multiple UAVs in a coordinated manner without the need for human intervention. This is suited to both military and civilian applications. Simulation results demonstrate the convergence and configuration of the UAVs with arbitrary initial locations and orientations. The performance has been tested for various number of UAVs and different mobility patterns of the ground target. ",

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on graphs is drawing widespread attention. However, existing efforts mainly focus on the OOD issue of correlation shift. While another type, covariate shift, remains largely unexplored but is the focus of this work. From a data generation view, causal features are stable substructures in data, which play key roles in OOD generalization. While their complementary parts, environments, are unstable features that often lead to various distribution shifts. Correlation shift establishes spurious statistical correlations between environments and labels. In contrast, covariate shift means that there exist unseen environmental features in test data. Existing strategies of graph invariant learning and data augmentation suffer from limited environments or unstable causal features, which greatly limits their generalization ability on covariate shift. In view of that, we propose a novel graph augmentation strategy: Adversarial Causal Augmentation (AdvCA), to alleviate the covariate shift. Specifically, it adversarially augments the data to explore diverse distributions of the environments. Meanwhile, it keeps the causal features invariant across diverse environments. It maintains the environmental diversity while ensuring the invariance of the causal features, thereby effectively alleviating the covariate shift. Extensive experimental results with in-depth analyses demonstrate that AdvCA can outperform 14 baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets with various covariate shifts. ",

This imposes much more stringent requirements on the laser reliability, which are dominated by degradation mechanisms (e.g., sudden degradation) limiting the semiconductor laser lifetime. Physics-based approaches are often used to characterize the degradation behavior analytically, yet explicit domain knowledge and accurate mathematical models are required. Building such models can be very challenging due to a lack of a full understanding of the complex physical processes inducing the degradation under various operating conditions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we propose a new data-driven approach, extracting useful insights from the operational monitored data to predict the degradation trend without requiring any specific knowledge or using any physical model. The proposed approach is based on an unsupervised technique, a conditional variational autoencoder, and validated using vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) and tunable edge emitting laser reliability data. The experimental results confirm that our model (i) achieves a good degradation prediction and generalization performance by yielding an F1 score of 95.3%, (ii) outperforms several baseline ML based anomaly detection techniques, and (iii) helps to shorten the aging tests by early predicting the failed devices before the end of the test and thereby saving costs ",

In response, we propose an integrated framework for adapting and re-learning knowledge graphs from one coarse domain (biomedical) to a finer-define domain (oncology). In this framework, we apply distant-supervision on cross-domain knowledge graph adaptation. Consequently, no manual data annotation is required to train the model.

    "abstract": "Providing accurate estimated time of package delivery on users' purchasing pages for e-commerce platforms is of great importance to their purchasing decisions and post-purchase experiences. Although this problem shares some common issues with the conventional estimated time of arrival (ETA), it is more challenging with the following aspects: 1) Inductive inference. Models are required to predict ETA for orders with unseen retailers and addresses; 2) High-order interaction of order semantic information. Apart from the spatio-temporal features, the estimated time also varies greatly with other factors, such as the packaging efficiency of retailers, as well as the high-order interaction of these factors. In this paper, we propose an inductive graph transformer (IGT) that leverages raw feature information and structural graph data to estimate package delivery time. Different from previous graph transformer architectures, IGT adopts a decoupled pipeline and trains transformer as a regression function that can capture the multiplex information from both raw feature and dense embeddings encoded by a graph neural network (GNN). In addition, we further simplify the GNN structure by removing its non-linear activation and the learnable linear transformation matrix. The reduced parameter search space and linear information propagation in the simplified GNN enable the IGT to be applied in large-scale industrial scenarios. Experiments on real-world logistics datasets show that our proposed model can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods on estimation of delivery time.

The objective of the paper is an efficient classification of SCZ in 2 different classes: Cognitive Normal (CN), and SCZ using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. This paper proposed a lightweight 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework for SCZ diagnosis using MRI images. In the proposed model, lightweight 3D CNN is used to extract both spatial and spectral features simultaneously from 3D volume MRI scans, and classification is done using an ensemble bagging classifier.

These datasets have undergone preprocessing steps to register all the MRI images to the standard template and reduce the artifacts.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a remote sensing technique that can provide measurements of affected areas independent of weather or lighting conditions. Usage of SAR, however, is hindered by domain knowledge that is necessary for the pre-processing steps and its interpretation requires expert knowledge. We provide simplified, pre-processed, machine-learning ready SAR datacubes for four globally located landslide events obtained from several Sentinel-1 satellite passes before and after a landslide triggering event together with segmentation maps of the landslides. From this dataset, using the Hokkaido, Japan datacube, we study the feasibility of SAR-based landslide detection with supervised deep learning (DL). Our results demonstrate that DL models can be used to detect landslides from SAR data, achieving an Area under the Precision-Recall curve exceeding 0.7. We find that additional satellite visits enhance detection performance, but that early detection is possible when SAR data is combined with terrain information from a digital elevation model. This can be especially useful for time-critical emergency interventions. Code is made publicly available at https://github.com/iprapas/landslide-sar-unet. ",

Especially in the medical domain, where the collection of large-scale data sets is challenging and expensive due to limited access to patient data, relevant environments, as well as strict regulations, community-curated large-scale public datasets, pretrained models, and advanced data augmentation methods are the main factors for developing reliable systems to improve patient care. However, for the development of medical acoustic sensing systems, an emerging field of research, the community lacks large-scale publicly available data sets and pretrained models. To address the problem of limited data, we propose a conditional generative adversarial neural network-based augmentation method which is able to synthesize mel spectrograms from a learned data distribution of a source data set. In contrast to previously proposed fully convolutional models, the proposed model implements residual Squeeze and Excitation modules in the generator architecture. We show that our method outperforms all classical audio augmentation techniques and previously published generative methods in terms of generated sample quality and a performance improvement of 2.84% of Macro F1-Score for a classifier trained on the augmented data set, an enhancement of $1.14\\%$ in relation to previous work. By analyzing the correlation of intermediate feature spaces, we show that the residual Squeeze and Excitation modules help the model to reduce redundancy in the latent features. Therefore, the proposed model advances the state-of-the-art in the augmentation of clinical audio data and improves the data bottleneck for the design of clinical acoustic sensing systems. ",

This so-called off-manifold conjecture has inspired a novel line of defenses against adversarial attacks on images. In this study, we find a similar phenomenon occurs in the contextualized embedding space induced by pretrained language models, in which adversarial texts tend to have their embeddings diverge from the manifold of natural ones. Based on this finding, we propose Textual Manifold-based Defense (TMD), a defense mechanism that projects text embeddings onto an approximated embedding manifold before classification. It reduces the complexity of potential adversarial examples, which ultimately enhances the robustness of the protected model. Through extensive experiments, our method consistently and significantly outperforms previous defenses under various attack settings without trading off clean accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first NLP defense that leverages the manifold structure against adversarial attacks. Our code is available at \\url{https://github.com/dangne/tmd}. ",

This paper proposes a simple but effective transfer learning framework to empower data-driven evolutionary optimization to solve dynamic optimization problems. Specifically, it applies a hierarchical multi-output Gaussian process to capture the correlation between data collected from different time steps with a linearly increased number of hyperparameters. Furthermore, an adaptive source task selection along with a bespoke warm staring initialization mechanisms are proposed to better leverage the knowledge extracted from previous optimization exercises. By doing so, the data-driven evolutionary optimization can jump start the optimization in the new environment with a strictly limited computational budget.

However, to our knowledge, no previous work considers a unified model that incorporates the important multi-view information with those properties, which severely limits the performance of existing methods. In this paper, we formulate a novel clustering model, which exploits the non-negative feature property and, more importantly, incorporates the multi-view information into a unified joint learning framework: the unified multi-view orthonormal non-negative graph based clustering framework (Umv-ONGC). Then, we derive an effective three-stage iterative solution for the proposed model and provide analytic solutions for the three sub-problems from the three stages.

This attack can be perpetrated even if the target model is a black box, supposed that the machine-learning model is provided as a service and the attacker can query the model and collect its outputs. So far, no defense has been demonstrated effective in this scenario. We show for the first time that this attack is detectable using stateful defenses, which store the queries made to the classifier and detect the abnormal cases in which they are similar. Once a malicious query is detected, the account of the user who made it can be blocked. Thus, the attacker must create many accounts to perpetrate the attack. To decrease this number, the attacker could create the adversarial program against a surrogate classifier and then fine-tune it by making few queries to the target model. In this scenario, the effectiveness of the stateful defense is reduced, but we show that it is still effective. ",

To measure spurious behaviour as deviation from a ground truth network, we simulate time-dependent isotropic random fields on the sphere and apply common network construction techniques. We find several ways in which the uncertainty stemming from the estimation procedure has major impact on network characteristics. When the data has locally coherent correlation structure, spurious link bundle teleconnections and spurious high-degree clusters have to be expected. Anisotropic estimation variance can also induce severe biases into empirical networks. We validate our findings with ERA5 reanalysis data. Moreover we explain why commonly applied resampling procedures are inappropriate for significance evaluation and propose a statistically more meaningful ensemble construction framework. By communicating which difficulties arise in estimation from scarce data and by presenting which design decisions increase robustness, we hope to contribute to more reliable climate network construction in the future.

Our method learns deformation fields at multiple resolutions and uses a spatial transformer to modify the garment and model size. We evaluate our approach along three dimensions: realism, garment faithfulness, and size. To our knowledge, SizeGAN is the first method to focus on this size under-representation problem for modeling clothing. We provide an analysis comparing SizeGAN to other plausible approaches and additionally provide the first clothing dataset with size labels. In a user study comparing SizeGAN and two recent virtual try-on methods, we show that our method ranks first in each dimension, and was vastly preferred for realism and garment faithfulness. In comparison to most previous work, which has focused on generating photorealistic images of garments, our work shows that it is possible to generate images that are both photorealistic and cover diverse garment sizes.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a family of novel quantum kernels, namely the Hierarchical Aligned Quantum Jensen-Shannon Kernels (HAQJSK), for un-attributed graphs. Different from most existing classical graph kernels, the proposed HAQJSK kernels can incorporate hierarchical aligned structure information between graphs and transform graphs of random sizes into fixed-sized aligned graph structures, i.e., the Hierarchical Transitive Aligned Adjacency Matrix of vertices and the Hierarchical Transitive Aligned Density Matrix of the Continuous-Time Quantum Walk (CTQW). For a pair of graphs to hand, the resulting HAQJSK kernels are defined by measuring the Quantum Jensen-Shannon Divergence (QJSD) between their transitive aligned graph structures. We show that the proposed HAQJSK kernels not only reflect richer intrinsic global graph characteristics in terms of the CTQW, but also address the drawback of neglecting structural correspondence information arising in most existing R-convolution kernels. Furthermore, unlike the previous Quantum Jensen-Shannon Kernels associated with the QJSD and the CTQW, the proposed HAQJSK kernels can simultaneously guarantee the properties of permutation invariant and positive definiteness, explaining the theoretical advantages of the HAQJSK kernels. Experiments indicate the effectiveness of the proposed kernels. ",

    "title": "Robust Reflection Removal with Flash-only Cues in the Wild",
    "abstract": "We propose a simple yet effective reflection-free cue for robust reflection removal from a pair of flash and ambient (no-flash) images. The reflection-free cue exploits a flash-only image obtained by subtracting the ambient image from the corresponding flash image in raw data space. The flash-only image is equivalent to an image taken in a dark environment with only a flash on. This flash-only image is visually reflection-free and thus can provide robust cues to infer the reflection in the ambient image. Since the flash-only image usually has artifacts, we further propose a dedicated model that not only utilizes the reflection-free cue but also avoids introducing artifacts, which helps accurately estimate reflection and transmission. Our experiments on real-world images with various types of reflection demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with reflection-free flash-only cues: our model outperforms state-of-the-art reflection removal approaches by more than 5.23dB in PSNR. We extend our approach to handheld photography to address the misalignment between the flash and no-flash pair. With misaligned training data and the alignment module, our aligned model outperforms our previous version by more than 3.19dB in PSNR on a misaligned dataset. We also study using linear RGB images as training data. Our source code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/ChenyangLEI/flash-reflection-removal. ",

    "abstract": "Epistemic graphs generalize the epistemic approach to probabilistic argumentation and tackle the uncertainties in and between arguments. A framework was proposed to generate epistemic constraints from data using a two-way generalization method in the perspective of only considering the beliefs of participants without considering the nature of relations represented in an epistemic graph. The deficiency of original framework is that it is unable to learn rules using tighter constraints, and the learnt rules might be counterintuitive. Meanwhile, when dealing with more restricted values, the filtering computational complexity will increase sharply, and the time performance would become unreasonable. This paper introduces a filtering-based approach using a multiple-way generalization step to generate a set of rational rules based on both the beliefs of each agent on different arguments and the epistemic graph corresponding to the epistemic constraints. This approach is able to generated rational rules with multiple restricted values in higher efficiency. Meanwhile, we have proposed a standard to analyze the rationality of a dataset based on the postulates of deciding rational rules. We evaluate the filtering-based approach on two suitable data bases. The empirical results show that the filtering-based approach performs well with a better efficiency comparing to the original framework, and rules generated from the improved approach are ensured to be rational.

Using large-scale Medicare claims data, we identify patterns consistent with fraud or overbilling among inpatient hospitalizations. Our proposed approach for Medicare fraud detection is fully unsupervised, not relying on any labeled training data, and is explainable to end users, providing reasoning and interpretable insights into the potentially suspicious behavior of the flagged providers.

In the theory community, the most popular approach for map matching is to compute a path on the road network that is the most spatially similar to the trajectory, where spatial similarity is measured using the Fr\\'echet distance. A shortcoming of existing map matching algorithms under the Fr\\'echet distance is that every time a trajectory is matched, the entire road network needs to be reprocessed from scratch. An open problem is whether one can preprocess the road network into a data structure, so that map matching queries can be answered in sublinear time. In this paper, we investigate map matching queries under the Fr\\'echet distance. We provide a negative result for geometric planar graphs. We show that, unless SETH fails, there is no data structure that can be constructed in polynomial time that answers map matching queries in $O((pq)^{1-\\delta})$ query time for any $\\delta > 0$, where $p$ and $q$ are the complexities of the geometric planar graph and the query trajectory, respectively. We provide a positive result for realistic input graphs, which we regard as the main result of this paper. We show that for $c$-packed graphs, one can construct a data structure of $\\tilde O(cp)$ size that can answer $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate map matching queries in $\\tilde O(c^4 q \\log^4 p)$ time, where $\\tilde O(\\cdot)$ hides lower-order factors and dependence of $\\varepsilon$.

    "abstract": "Natural Language Inference (NLI) or Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) aims at predicting the relation between a pair of sentences (premise and hypothesis) as entailment, contradiction or semantic independence. Although deep learning models have shown promising performance for NLI in recent years, they rely on large scale expensive human-annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a popular technique for reducing the reliance on human annotation by leveraging unlabeled data for training. However, despite its substantial success on single sentence classification tasks where the challenge in making use of unlabeled data is to assign \"good enough\" pseudo-labels, for NLI tasks, the nature of unlabeled data is more complex: one of the sentences in the pair (usually the hypothesis) along with the class label are missing from the data and require human annotations, which makes SSL for NLI more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel way to incorporate unlabeled data in SSL for NLI where we use a conditional language model, BART to generate the hypotheses for the unlabeled sentences (used as premises). Our experiments show that our SSL framework successfully exploits unlabeled data and substantially improves the performance of four NLI datasets in low-resource settings.

Our GAN architecture allows for better utilization of multiple observations by disentangling content and motion to enable controllable semantic edits. To this end, we introduce two tightly coupled networks: (i) a representation network for constructing a concise understanding of motion dynamics and temporally invariant content, and (ii) a translation network that exploits the extracted latent content representation to actuate the manipulation according to the target description. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that DiCoMoGAN significantly outperforms existing frame-based methods, producing temporally coherent and semantically more meaningful results.

    "abstract": "Proper functioning of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is crucial for the safety and efficiency of future intelligent transport systems. Meanwhile, transitioning to fully autonomous driving requires a long period of mixed autonomy traffic, including both CAVs and human-driven vehicles. Thus, collaboration decision-making for CAVs is essential to generate appropriate driving behaviors to enhance the safety and efficiency of mixed autonomy traffic. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been widely used in solving decision-making problems. However, the existing DRL-based methods have been mainly focused on solving the decision-making of a single CAV. Using the existing DRL-based methods in mixed autonomy traffic cannot accurately represent the mutual effects of vehicles and model dynamic traffic environments. To address these shortcomings, this article proposes a graph reinforcement learning (GRL) approach for multi-agent decision-making of CAVs in mixed autonomy traffic. First, a generic and modular GRL framework is designed. Then, a systematic review of DRL and GRL methods is presented, focusing on the problems addressed in recent research. Moreover, a comparative study on different GRL methods is further proposed based on the designed framework to verify the effectiveness of GRL methods. Results show that the GRL methods can well optimize the performance of multi-agent decision-making for CAVs in mixed autonomy traffic compared to the DRL methods. Finally, challenges and future research directions are summarized. This study can provide a valuable research reference for solving the multi-agent decision-making problems of CAVs in mixed autonomy traffic and can promote the implementation of GRL-based methods into intelligent transportation systems.

In particular, unlike the traditional GNNs that are trained based on the entire graph in a full-batch manner, recent GNNs have been developed with different graph sampling techniques for mini-batch training of GNNs on large graphs. While they improve the scalability, their training times still depend on the implementations in the frameworks as sampling and its associated operations can introduce non-negligible overhead and computational cost. In addition, it is unknown how much the frameworks are 'eco-friendly' from a green computing perspective.

    "title": "Efficient Traffic State Forecasting using Spatio-Temporal Network  Dependencies: A Sparse Graph Neural Network Approach",
    "abstract": "Traffic state prediction in a transportation network is paramount for effective traffic operations and management, as well as informed user and system-level decision-making. However, long-term traffic prediction (beyond 30 minutes into the future) remains challenging in current research. In this work, we integrate the spatio-temporal dependencies in the transportation network from network modeling, together with the graph convolutional network (GCN) and graph attention network (GAT). To further tackle the dramatic computation and memory cost caused by the giant model size (i.e., number of weights) caused by multiple cascaded layers, we propose sparse training to mitigate the training cost, while preserving the prediction accuracy. It is a process of training using a fixed number of nonzero weights in each layer in each iteration. We consider the problem of long-term traffic speed forecasting for a real large-scale transportation network data from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Experimental results show that the proposed GCN-STGT and GAT-STGT models achieve low prediction errors on short-, mid- and long-term prediction horizons, of 15, 30 and 45 minutes in duration, respectively. Using our sparse training, we could train from scratch with high sparsity (e.g., up to 90%), equivalent to 10 times floating point operations per second (FLOPs) reduction on computational cost using the same epochs as dense training, and arrive at a model with very small accuracy loss compared with the original dense training ",

However, with the right knowledge, these tasks can be completed by robots with a high degree of success, reducing the amount of human effort required to complete daily tasks. In this paper, the FOON, which describes the robot action success rate, is discussed. The functional object-oriented network (FOON) is a knowledge representation for symbolic task planning that takes the shape of a graph. It is to demonstrate the adaptability of FOON in developing a novel and adaptive method of solving a problem utilizing knowledge obtained from various sources, a graph retrieval methodology is shown to produce manipulation motion sequences from the FOON to accomplish a desired aim. The outcomes are illustrated using motion sequences created by the FOON to complete the desired objectives in a simulated environment. ",

Most existing methods apply various large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) finetuned in LJP tasks to obtain consistent improvements. However, we discover the fact that the state-of-the-art (SOTA) model makes judgment predictions according to wrong (or non-casual) information, which not only weakens the model's generalization capability but also results in severe social problems like discrimination. Here, we analyze the causal mechanism misleading the LJP model to learn the spurious correlations, and then propose a framework to guide the model to learn the underlying causality knowledge in the legal texts. Specifically, we first perform open information extraction (OIE) to refine the text having a high proportion of causal information, according to which we generate a new set of data. Then, we design a model learning the weights of the refined data and the raw data for LJP model training. The extensive experimental results show that our model is more generalizable and robust than the baselines and achieves a new SOTA performance on two commonly used legal-specific datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Target-specific stance detection on social media, which aims at classifying a textual data instance such as a post or a comment into a stance class of a target issue, has become an emerging opinion mining paradigm of importance. An example application would be to overcome vaccine hesitancy in combating the coronavirus pandemic. However, existing stance detection strategies rely merely on the individual instances which cannot always capture the expressed stance of a given target. In response, we address a new task called conversational stance detection which is to infer the stance towards a given target (e.g., COVID-19 vaccination) when given a data instance and its corresponding conversation thread. To tackle the task, we first propose a benchmarking conversational stance detection (CSD) dataset with annotations of stances and the structures of conversation threads among the instances based on six major social media platforms in Hong Kong. To infer the desired stances from both data instances and conversation threads, we propose a model called Branch-BERT that incorporates contextual information in conversation threads. Extensive experiments on our CSD dataset show that our proposed model outperforms all the baseline models that do not make use of contextual information. Specifically, it improves the F1 score by 10.3% compared with the state-of-the-art method in the SemEval-2016 Task 6 competition. This shows the potential of incorporating rich contextual information on detecting target-specific stances on social media platforms and implies a more practical way to construct future stance detection tasks.

It is based on patch embeddings, rather than attentions paid to them, and their causal impacts on the model output. ViT-CX can be used to explain different ViT models. Empirical results show that, in comparison with previous methods, ViT-CX produces more meaningful saliency maps and does a better job at revealing all the important evidence for prediction.

Despite its usefulness, the blockchain is vulnerable to cyber assaults; for example, in January 2019 a 51% attack on Ethereum Classic successfully exposed flaws in the platform's security. From a statistical point of view, attacks represent a highly unusual occurrence that deviates significantly from the norm. Blockchain attack detection may benefit from Deep Learning, a field of study whose aim is to discover insights, patterns, and anomalies within massive data repositories. In this work, we define an trusted two way intrusion detection system based on a Hierarchical weighed fuzzy algorithm and self-organized stacked network (SOSN) deep learning model, that is trained exploiting aggregate information extracted by monitoring blockchain activities. Here initially the smart contract handles the node authentication. The purpose of authenticating the node is to ensure that only specific nodes can submit and retrieve the information. We implement Hierarchical weighed fuzzy algorithm to evaluate the trust ability of the transaction nodes. Then the transaction verification step ensures that all malicious transactions or activities on the submitted transaction by self-organized stacked network deep learning model. The whole experimentation was carried out under matlab environment. Extensive experimental results confirm that our suggested detection method has better performance over important indicators such as Precision, Recall, F-Score, overhead. ",

To address these challenges, a novel multi-scale multi-grained deep network (MSMG-Net) is proposed to automatically identify manipulated regions. In our MSMG-Net, a parallel multi-scale feature extraction structure is used to extract multi-scale features. Then the multi-grained feature learning is utilized to perceive object-level semantics relation of multi-scale features by introducing the shunted self-attention. To fuse multi-scale multi-grained features, global and local feature fusion block are designed for manipulated region segmentation by a bottom-up approach and multi-level feature aggregation block is designed for edge artifacts detection by a top-down approach. Thus, MSMG-Net can effectively perceive the object-level semantics and encode the edge artifact. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets justify the superior performance of the proposed method, outperforming state-of-the-art manipulation detection and localization methods. Extensive ablation experiments and feature visualization demonstrate the multi-scale multi-grained learning can present effective visual representations of manipulated regions. In addition, MSMG-Net shows better robustness when various post-processing methods further manipulate images. ",

This gives rise to many, oftentimes unexpected, challenges for creating technology in a lab environment that will work when deployed in real home environments. In other words, like more mature disciplines, we need solutions for what can be done at development time to increase success at deployment time. To illustrate an approach and solutions, we use an example of an ongoing project that is a pipeline of voice based machine learning solutions that detects the anger and verbal conflicts of the participants. For anonymity, we call it the XYZ system. XYZ is a smart health technology because by notifying the participants of their anger, it encourages the participants to better manage their emotions. This is important because being able to recognize one's emotions is the first step to better managing one's anger. XYZ was deployed in 6 homes for 4 months each and monitors the emotion of the caregiver of a dementia patient. In this paper we demonstrate some of the necessary steps to be accomplished during the development stage to increase deployment time success, and show where continued work is still necessary.

Such instabilities in DNNs can be explained by the fact that they ignore the forward measurement model during deployment, and thus fail to enforce consistency between their output and the input measurements. To overcome this, we propose a framework that transforms any DNN for inverse problems into a measurement-consistent one. This is done by appending to it an implicit layer (or deep equilibrium network) designed to solve a model-based optimization problem. The implicit layer consists of a shallow learnable network that can be integrated into the end-to-end training.

There are two main variants of contrastive learning, namely instance and class discrimination, targeting features that can discriminate between different instances for the former, and different classes for the latter. In this paper, we aim to understand the effectiveness and limitation of existing contrastive learning methods for OOD detection. We approach this in 3 ways. First, we systematically study the performance difference between the instance discrimination and supervised contrastive learning variants in different OOD detection settings. Second, we study which in-distribution (ID) classes OOD data tend to be classified into. Finally, we study the spectral decay property of the different contrastive learning approaches and examine how it correlates with OOD detection performance. In scenarios where the ID and OOD datasets are sufficiently different from one another, we see that instance discrimination, in the absence of fine-tuning, is competitive with supervised approaches in OOD detection. We see that OOD samples tend to be classified into classes that have a distribution similar to the distribution of the entire dataset. Furthermore, we show that contrastive learning learns a feature space that contains singular vectors containing several directions with a high variance which can be detrimental or beneficial to OOD detection depending on the inference approach used.

Even though AI-driven digital agriculture can offer high-performing predictive functionalities, it lacks tangible quantitative evidence on its benefits to the farmers. Field experiments can derive such evidence, but are often costly and time consuming. To this end, we propose an observational causal inference framework for the empirical evaluation of the impact of digital tools on target farm performance indicators. This way, we can increase farmers' trust by enhancing the transparency of the digital agriculture market, and in turn accelerate the adoption of technologies that aim to increase productivity and secure a sustainable and resilient agriculture against a changing climate. As a case study, we perform an empirical evaluation of a recommendation system for optimal cotton sowing, which was used by a farmers' cooperative during the growing season of 2021. We leverage agricultural knowledge to develop a causal graph of the farm system, we use the back-door criterion to identify the impact of recommendations on the yield and subsequently estimate it using several methods on observational data. The results show that a field sown according to our recommendations enjoyed a significant increase in yield (12% to 17%). ",

    "abstract": "As the demand for user privacy grows, controlled data removal (machine unlearning) is becoming an important feature of machine learning models for data-sensitive Web applications such as social networks and recommender systems. Nevertheless, at this point it is still largely unknown how to perform efficient machine unlearning of graph neural networks (GNNs); this is especially the case when the number of training samples is small, in which case unlearning can seriously compromise the performance of the model. To address this issue, we initiate the study of unlearning the Graph Scattering Transform (GST), a mathematical framework that is efficient, provably stable under feature or graph topology perturbations, and offers graph classification performance comparable to that of GNNs. Our main contribution is the first known nonlinear approximate graph unlearning method based on GSTs. Our second contribution is a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity of the proposed unlearning mechanism, which is hard to replicate for deep neural networks. Our third contribution are extensive simulation results which show that, compared to complete retraining of GNNs after each removal request, the new GST-based approach offers, on average, a $10.38$x speed-up and leads to a $2.6$% increase in test accuracy during unlearning of $90$ out of $100$ training graphs from the IMDB dataset ($10$% training ratio).

A deliberation network consists of multiple standard sequence-to-sequence models, each one conditioned on the initial input and the output of the previous model. During training, there are several key questions: whether to apply Monte Carlo approximation to the gradients or the loss, whether to train the standard models jointly or separately, whether to run an intermediate model in teacher forcing or free running mode, whether to apply task-specific techniques. Previous work on deliberation networks typically explores one or two training options for a specific task. This work introduces a unifying framework, covering various training options, and addresses the above questions. In general, it is simpler to approximate the gradients. When parallel training is essential, separate training should be adopted. Regardless of the task, the intermediate model should be in free running mode. For tasks where the output is continuous, a guided attention loss can be used to prevent degradation into a standard model. ",

We present an improved simulation of the WL test on GNNs with \\emph{exponentially} lower complexity. In particular, the neural network implementing the combine function in each node has only a polylogarithmic number of parameters in $n$, and the feature vectors exchanged by the nodes of GNN consists of only $O(\\log n)$ bits. We also give logarithmic lower bounds for the feature vector length and the size of the neural networks, showing the (near)-optimality of our construction. ",

In this paper, we present a framework to neurally solve partial differential equations over domains with irregularly shaped (non-rectilinear) geometric boundaries. Our network takes in the shape of the domain as an input (represented using an unstructured point cloud, or any other parametric representation such as Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines) and is able to generalize to novel (unseen) irregular domains; the key technical ingredient to realizing this model is a novel approach for identifying the interior and exterior of the computational grid in a differentiable manner. We also perform a careful error analysis which reveals theoretical insights into several sources of error incurred in the model-building process. Finally, we showcase a wide variety of applications, along with favorable comparisons with ground truth solutions. ",

The algorithm includes image-to-tree conversion by greedy extraction of the fractal pattern skeleton along with a custom-built graph matching algorithm that is robust against imaging artifacts such as scaling, rotation, scratch, and illumination change. The proposed algorithm is applicable to a variety of tree-structured image matching, but our focus is on dendrites, recently-developed visual identifiers. Dendrites are entropy rich and unclonable with existing 2D and 3D printers due to their natural randomness, nano-resolution granularity, and 3D facets, making them an appropriate choice for security applications such as supply chain trace and tracking. The proposed algorithm improves upon graph matching with standard image descriptors. For instance, image inconsistency due to the camera sensor noise may cause unexpected feature extraction leading to inaccurate tree conversion and authentication failure. Also, previous tree extraction algorithms are prohibitively slow hindering their scalability to large systems. In this paper, we fix the current issues of [1] and accelerate the key points extraction up to 10-times faster by implementing a new skeleton extraction method, a new key points searching algorithm, as well as an optimized key point matching algorithm. Using minimum enclosing circle and center points, make the algorithm robust to the choice of pattern shape. In contrast to [1] our algorithm handles general graphs with loop connections, therefore is applicable to a wider range of applications such as transportation map analysis, fingerprints, and retina vessel imaging.

The channel state information (CSI) ratio has been applied to resolve these issues, however, current research on the CSI ratio is limited to Doppler estimation in a single dynamic path. This paper proposes an advanced parameter estimation scheme that can extract multiple dynamic parameters, including Doppler frequency, angle-of-arrival (AoA), and delay, in a communication uplink channel and completes the localization of multiple moving targets. Our scheme is based on the multi-element Taylor series of the CSI ratio that converts a nonlinear function of sensing parameters to linear forms and enables the applications of traditional sensing algorithms. Using the truncated Taylor series, we develop novel multiple-signal-classification grid searching algorithms for estimating Doppler frequencies and AoAs and use the least-square method to obtain delays. Both experimental and simulation results are provided, demonstrating that our proposed scheme can achieve good performances for sensing both single and multiple dynamic paths, without requiring the presence of a LOS path.

To this end, the robots could be both physically soft with multimodal sensing/perception, so that the robots could have better awareness of the surrounding environment, as well as to respond properly to humans' action/intention. This paper introduces a novel soft robotic link, named ProTac, that possesses multiple sensing modes: tactile and proximity sensing, based on computer vision and a functional material. These modalities come from a layered structure of a soft transparent silicon skin, a polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) film, and reflective markers. Here, the PDLC film can switch actively between the opaque and the transparent state, from which the tactile sensing and proximity sensing can be obtained by using cameras solely built inside the ProTac link. In this paper, inference algorithms for tactile proximity perception are introduced. Evaluation results of two sensing modalities demonstrated that, with a simple activation strategy, ProTac link could effectively perceive useful information from both approaching and in-contact obstacles. The proposed sensing device is expected to bring in ultimate solutions for design of robots with softness, whole-body and multimodal sensing, and safety control strategies. ",

Existing methods, unfortunately, are not aware of the fact that embeddings from pre-trained models contain a prominently large amount of information regarding word frequencies, biasing prototypical neural networks against learning word entities. This discrepancy constrains the two models' synergy. Thus, we propose a one-line-code normalization method to reconcile such a mismatch with empirical and theoretical grounds. Our experiments based on nine benchmark datasets show the superiority of our method over the counterpart models and are comparable to the state-of-the-art methods. In addition to the model enhancement, our work also provides an analytical viewpoint for addressing the general problems in few-shot name entity recognition or other tasks that rely on pre-trained models or prototypical neural networks.

    "abstract": "Large-scale multiphysics simulations are computationally challenging due to the coupling of multiple processes with widely disparate time scales. The advent of exascale computing systems exacerbates these challenges, since these enable ever increasing size and complexity. Recently, there has been renewed interest in developing multirate methods as a means to handle the large range of time scales, as these methods may afford greater accuracy and efficiency than more traditional approaches of using IMEX and low-order operator splitting schemes. However, there have been few performance studies that compare different classes of multirate integrators on complex application problems. We study the performance of several newly developed multirate infinitesimal (MRI) methods, implemented in the SUNDIALS solver package, on two reacting flow model problems built on structured mesh frameworks. The first model revisits the work of Emmet et al. (2014) on a compressible reacting flow problem with complex chemistry that is implemented using BoxLib but where we now include comparisons between a new explicit MRI scheme with the multirate spectral deferred correction (SDC) methods in the original paper. The second problem uses the same complex chemistry as the first problem, combined with a simplified flow model, but run at a large spatial scale where explicit methods become infeasible due to stability constraints. Two recently developed implicit-explicit MRI multirate methods are tested. These methods rely on advanced features of the AMReX framework on which the model is built, such as multilevel grids and multilevel preconditioners. The results from these two problems show that MRI multirate methods can offer significant performance benefits on complex multiphysics application problems and that these methods may be combined with advanced spatial discretization to compound the advantages of both.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL), as a rapidly evolving privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning paradigm, is a promising approach to enable edge intelligence in the emerging Industrial Metaverse. Even though many successful use cases have proved the feasibility of FL in theory, in the industrial practice of Metaverse, the problems of non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data, learning forgetting caused by streaming industrial data, and scarce communication bandwidth remain key barriers to realize practical FL. Facing the above three challenges simultaneously, this paper presents a high-performance and efficient system named HFEDMS for incorporating practical FL into Industrial Metaverse. HFEDMS reduces data heterogeneity through dynamic grouping and training mode conversion (Dynamic Sequential-to-Parallel Training, STP). Then, it compensates for the forgotten knowledge by fusing compressed historical data semantics and calibrates classifier parameters (Semantic Compression and Compensation, SCC). Finally, the network parameters of the feature extractor and classifier are synchronized in different frequencies (Layer-wiseAlternative Synchronization Protocol, LASP) to reduce communication costs. These techniques make FL more adaptable to the heterogeneous streaming data continuously generated by industrial equipment, and are also more efficient in communication than traditional methods (e.g., Federated Averaging). Extensive experiments have been conducted on the streamed non-i.i.d. FEMNIST dataset using 368 simulated devices. Numerical results show that HFEDMS improves the classification accuracy by at least 6.4% compared with 8 benchmarks and saves both the overall runtime and transfer bytes by up to 98%, proving its superiority in precision and efficiency.

Among many network analysis techniques, dense subgraph discovery, aiming to find a dense component in a network, is an essential primitive with a variety of applications in diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization model for dense subgraph discovery in multilayer networks. Our model aims to find a stochastic solution, i.e., a probability distribution over the family of vertex subsets, rather than a single vertex subset, whereas it can also be used for obtaining a single vertex subset. For our model, we design an LP-based polynomial-time exact algorithm.

Our IGNR has the benefit that it can represent graphons up to arbitrary resolutions, and enables natural and efficient generation of arbitrary sized graphs with desired structure once the model is learned. Furthermore, we allow the input graph data to be unaligned and have different sizes by leveraging the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by showing its superior performance on a graphon learning task. We then propose an extension of IGNR that can be incorporated into an auto-encoder framework, and demonstrate its good performance under a more general setting of graphon learning.

In this article, we provide a promptly overview of Air-ISCC by introducing the fundamentals, discussing the advanced techniques, and identifying the applications. ",

    "abstract": "As ultra-realistic face forgery techniques emerge, deepfake detection has attracted increasing attention due to security concerns. Many detectors cannot achieve accurate results when detecting unseen manipulations despite excellent performance on known forgeries. In this paper, we are motivated by the observation that the discrepancies between real and fake videos are extremely subtle and localized, and inconsistencies or irregularities can exist in some critical facial regions across various information domains. To this end, we propose a novel pipeline, Cross-Domain Local Forensics (XDLF), for more general deepfake video detection. In the proposed pipeline, a specialized framework is presented to simultaneously exploit local forgery patterns from space, frequency, and time domains, thus learning cross-domain features to detect forgeries. Moreover, the framework leverages four high-level forgery-sensitive local regions of a human face to guide the model to enhance subtle artifacts and localize potential anomalies. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the impressive performance of our method, and we achieve superiority over several state-of-the-art methods on cross-dataset generalization. We also examined the factors that contribute to its performance through ablations, which suggests that exploiting cross-domain local characteristics is a noteworthy direction for developing more general deepfake detectors.

Multiple surveys demonstrate the agreement of human evaluators when assigning numerical probability levels to WEP. For example, highly likely corresponds to a median chance of 0.90+-0.08 in Fagen-Ulmschneider (2015)'s survey. In this work, we measure the ability of neural language processing models to capture the consensual probability level associated to each WEP. Firstly, we use the UNLI dataset (Chen et al., 2020) which associates premises and hypotheses with their perceived joint probability p, to construct prompts, e.g. \"[PREMISE]. [WEP], [HYPOTHESIS].\" and assess whether language models can predict whether the WEP consensual probability level is close to p. Secondly, we construct a dataset of WEP-based probabilistic reasoning, to test whether language models can reason with WEP compositions. When prompted \"[EVENTA] is likely. [EVENTB] is impossible.\", a causal language model should not express that [EVENTA&B] is likely. We show that both tasks are unsolved by off-the-shelf English language models, but that fine-tuning leads to transferable improvement. ",

However, there are many problems and bottlenecks in traditional causal learning methods, such as high-dimensional unstructured variables, combinatorial optimization problems, unknown intervention, unobserved confounders, selection bias and estimation bias. Deep causal learning, that is, causal learning based on deep neural networks, brings new insights for addressing these problems. While many deep learning-based causal discovery and causal inference methods have been proposed, there is a lack of reviews exploring the internal mechanism of deep learning to improve causal learning. In this article, we comprehensively review how deep learning can contribute to causal learning by addressing conventional challenges from three aspects: representation, discovery, and inference. We point out that deep causal learning is important for the theoretical extension and application expansion of causal science and is also an indispensable part of general artificial intelligence.

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based recommender systems may lead to over-fitting when lacking training interaction data. This over-fitting significantly degrades recommendation performances. To address this data sparsity problem, cross-domain recommender systems (CDRSs) exploit the data from an auxiliary source domain to facilitate the recommendation on the sparse target domain. Most existing CDRSs rely on overlapping users or items to connect domains and transfer knowledge. However, matching users is an arduous task and may involve privacy issues when data comes from different companies, resulting in a limited application for the above CDRSs. Some studies develop CDRSs that require no overlapping users and items by transferring learned user interaction patterns. However, they ignore the bias in user interaction patterns between domains and hence suffer from an inferior performance compared with single-domain recommender systems. In this paper, based on the above findings, we propose a novel CDRS, namely semantic clustering enhanced debiasing graph neural recommender system (SCDGN), that requires no overlapping users and items and can handle the domain bias. More precisely, SCDGN semantically clusters items from both domains and constructs a cross-domain bipartite graph generated from item clusters and users. Then, the knowledge is transferred via this cross-domain user-cluster graph from the source to the target. Furthermore, we design a debiasing graph convolutional layer for SCDGN to extract unbiased structural knowledge from the cross-domain user-cluster graph. Our Experimental results on three public datasets and a pair of proprietary datasets verify the effectiveness of SCDGN over state-of-the-art models in terms of cross-domain recommendations. ",

    "abstract": "Humans demonstrate a variety of interesting behavioral characteristics when performing tasks, such as selecting between seemingly equivalent optimal actions, performing recovery actions when deviating from the optimal trajectory, or moderating actions in response to sensed risks. However, imitation learning, which attempts to teach robots to perform these same tasks from observations of human demonstrations, often fails to capture such behavior. Specifically, commonly used learning algorithms embody inherent contradictions between the learning assumptions (e.g., single optimal action) and actual human behavior (e.g., multiple optimal actions), thereby limiting robot generalizability, applicability, and demonstration feasibility. To address this, this paper proposes designing imitation learning algorithms with a focus on utilizing human behavioral characteristics, thereby embodying principles for capturing and exploiting actual demonstrator behavioral characteristics. This paper presents the first imitation learning framework, Bayesian Disturbance Injection (BDI), that typifies human behavioral characteristics by incorporating model flexibility, robustification, and risk sensitivity. Bayesian inference is used to learn flexible non-parametric multi-action policies, while simultaneously robustifying policies by injecting risk-sensitive disturbances to induce human recovery action and ensuring demonstration feasibility. Our method is evaluated through risk-sensitive simulations and real-robot experiments (e.g., table-sweep task, shaft-reach task and shaft-insertion task) using the UR5e 6-DOF robotic arm, to demonstrate the improved characterisation of behavior. Results show significant improvement in task performance, through improved flexibility, robustness as well as demonstration feasibility. ",

    "abstract": "Edge computing-based 3D perception has received attention in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) because real-time monitoring of traffic candidates potentially strengthens Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) orchestration. Thanks to the capability of precisely measuring the depth information on surroundings from LiDAR, the increasing studies focus on lidar-based 3D detection, which significantly promotes the development of 3D perception. Few methods met the real-time requirement of edge deployment because of high computation-intensive operations. Moreover, an inconsistency problem of object detection remains uncovered in the pointcloud domain due to large sparsity. This paper thoroughly analyses this problem, comprehensively roused by recent works on determining inconsistency problems in the image specialisation. Therefore, we proposed a 3D harmonic loss function to relieve the pointcloud based inconsistent predictions. Moreover, the feasibility of 3D harmonic loss is demonstrated from a mathematical optimization perspective. The KITTI dataset and DAIR-V2X-I dataset are used for simulations, and our proposed method considerably improves the performance than benchmark models. Further, the simulative deployment on an edge device (Jetson Xavier TX) validates our proposed model's efficiency. Our code is open-source and publicly available. ",

Multiple studies report significant deterioration of policy performance in a real-world environment. In this study, we focus on scenarios involving a simulation environment with uncertainty parameters and the set of their possible values, called the uncertainty parameter set. The aim is to optimize the worst-case performance on the uncertainty parameter set to guarantee the performance in the corresponding real-world environment. To obtain a policy for the optimization, we propose an off-policy actor-critic approach called the Max-Min Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (M2TD3), which solves a max-min optimization problem using a simultaneous gradient ascent descent approach. Experiments in multi-joint dynamics with contact (MuJoCo) environments show that the proposed method exhibited a worst-case performance superior to several baseline approaches. ",

In this paper we significantly improve that approach by reducing the computation of moving frames to only one, at the input stage, instead of repeated computations at each layer. The equivariance of the resulting architecture is proved theoretically and we build a rotation and translation equivariant neural network to process volumes, i.e. signals on the 3D space.

Despite performance of global models being the primary objective of FL systems, under heterogeneous settings client models have received more attention. Here, we provide more insights into how the chosen approach for training custom client models has an impact on the global model, which is essential for any FL application. We show the global model can fully leverage the strength of KD with heterogeneous data.

However, this introduces the data consistency problem. Due to the fundamental tradeoffs among consistency, availability, and latency in the presence of network partition, no a one-size-fits-all consistency model exists. To meet the needs of different applications, many popular data stores provide tunable consistency, allowing clients to specify the consistency level per individual operation. In this paper, we propose tunable causal consistency (TCC). It allows clients to choose the desired session guarantee for each operation, from the well-known four session guarantees, i.e., read your writes, monotonic reads, monotonic writes, and writes follow reads. Specifically, we first propose a formal specification of TCC in an extended (vis,ar) framework originally proposed by Burckhardt et al. Then we design a TCC protocol and develop a prototype distributed key-value store called TCCSTORE. We evaluate TCCSTORE on Aliyun. The latency is less than 38ms for all workloads and the throughput is up to about 2800 operations per second. We also show that TCC achieves better performance than causal consistency and requires a negligible overhead when compared with eventual consistency. ",

It is significant to assess the vulnerability of such forensic detectors against adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose a new black-box attack method against GAN-generated image detectors. A novel contrastive learning strategy is adopted to train the encoder-decoder network based anti-forensic model under a contrastive loss function. GAN images and their simulated real counterparts are constructed as positive and negative samples, respectively. Leveraging on the trained attack model, imperceptible contrastive perturbation could be applied to input synthetic images for removing GAN fingerprint to some extent. As such, existing GAN-generated image detectors are expected to be deceived.

    "abstract": "Numerous polluted groundwater sites across the globe require an active remediation strategy to restore natural environmental conditions and local ecosystem. The Engineered Nano-particles (ENPs) have emerged as an efficient reactive agent for the in-situ degradation of groundwater contaminants. While the performance of these ENPs has been highly promising on the laboratory scale, their application in real field case conditions is still limited. The complex transport and retention mechanisms of ENPs hinder the development of an efficient remediation strategy. Therefore, a predictive tool for understanding the transport and retention behavior of ENPs is highly required. The existing tools in the literature are dominated with numerical simulators, which have limited flexibility and accuracy in the presence of sparse datasets. This work uses a dynamic, weight-enabled Physics-Informed Neural Network (dw-PINN) framework to model the nano-particle behavior within an aquifer. The result from the forward model demonstrates the effective capability of dw-PINN in accurately predicting the ENPs mobility. The model verification step shows that the relative mean square error (MSE) of the predicted ENPs concentration using dw-PINN converges to a minimum value of $1.3{e^{-5}}$. In the subsequent step, the result from the inverse model estimates the governing parameters of ENPs mobility with reasonable accuracy. The research demonstrates the tool's capability to provide predictive insights for developing an efficient groundwater remediation strategy. ",

    "abstract": "Climate change has become one of the biggest challenges of our time. Social media platforms such as Twitter play an important role in raising public awareness and spreading knowledge about the dangers of the current climate crisis. With the increasing number of campaigns and communication about climate change through social media, the information could create more awareness and reach the general public and policy makers. However, these Twitter communications lead to polarization of beliefs, opinion-dominated ideologies, and often a split into two communities of climate change deniers and believers. In this paper, we propose a framework that helps identify denier statements on Twitter and thus classifies the stance of the tweet into one of the two attitudes towards climate change (denier/believer). The sentimental aspects of Twitter data on climate change are deeply rooted in general public attitudes toward climate change. Therefore, our work focuses on learning two closely related tasks: Stance Detection and Sentiment Analysis of climate change tweets. We propose a multi-task framework that performs stance detection (primary task) and sentiment analysis (auxiliary task) simultaneously. The proposed model incorporates the feature-specific and shared-specific attention frameworks to fuse multiple features and learn the generalized features for both tasks. The experimental results show that the proposed framework increases the performance of the primary task, i.e., stance detection by benefiting from the auxiliary task, i.e., sentiment analysis compared to its uni-modal and single-task variants.

We introduce the rigorous definitions of fundamental mathematical spaces before diving into KGE models and their mathematical properties. We further discuss different KGE methods over the three categories, as well as summarise how spatial advantages work over different embedding needs. By collating the experimental results from downstream tasks, we also explore the advantages of mathematical space in different scenarios and the reasons behind them. We further state some promising research directions from a representation space perspective, with which we hope to inspire researchers to design their KGE models as well as their related applications with more consideration of their mathematical space properties.

    "abstract": "The low replication rate of published studies has long concerned the social science community, making understanding the replicability a critical problem. Several studies have shown that relevant research communities can make predictions about the replicability of individual studies with above-chance accuracy. Follow-up work further indicates that laypeople can also achieve above-chance accuracy in predicting replicability when experts interpret the studies into short descriptions that are more accessible for laypeople. The involvement of scarce expert resources may make these methods expensive from financial and time perspectives. In this work, we explored whether laypeople can predict the replicability of social science studies without expert intervention. We presented laypeople with raw materials truncated from published social science papers and elicited their answers to questions related to the paper. Our results suggested that laypeople were engaged in this technical task, providing reasonable and self-contained answers. The majority of them also demonstrated a good understanding of the material. However, the solicited information had limited predictive power on the actual replication outcomes. We further discuss several lessons we learned compared to the approach with expert intervention to inspire future works. ",

In spite of their striking results, our theoretical understanding about how neural networks operate is limited. In particular, what are the interpolation capabilities of trained neural networks? In this paper we discuss a theorem of Domingos stating that \"every machine learned by continuous gradient descent is approximately a kernel machine\". According to Domingos, this fact leads to conclude that all machines trained on data are mere kernel machines. We first extend Domingo's result in the discrete case and to networks with vector-valued output. We then study its relevance and significance on simple examples. We find that in simple cases, the \"neural tangent kernel\" arising in Domingos' theorem does provide understanding of the networks' predictions. Furthermore, when the task given to the network grows in complexity, the interpolation capability of the network can be effectively explained by Domingos' theorem, and therefore is limited. We illustrate this fact on a classic perception theory problem: recovering a shape from its boundary. ",

Several papers recently appeared in the literature suggest that diversity could be leveraged to overcome this limitation effectively. In this paper a reference architecture is introduced, which describes how seamless link-level redundancy can be applied to Wi-Fi. The framework is general enough to serve as a basis for future protocol enhancements, and also includes two optimizations aimed at improving the quality of wireless communication by avoiding unnecessary replicated transmissions. Some relevant solutions have been analyzed by means of a thorough simulation campaign, in order to highlight their benefits when compared to conventional Wi-Fi.

Research in bias focuses primarily on facial recognition and attribute prediction with scarce emphasis on face detection. Existing studies consider face detection as binary classification into 'face' and 'non-face' classes. In this work, we investigate possible bias in the domain of face detection through facial region localization which is currently unexplored. Since facial region localization is an essential task for all face recognition pipelines, it is imperative to analyze the presence of such bias in popular deep models. Most existing face detection datasets lack suitable annotation for such analysis. Therefore, we web-curate the Fair Face Localization with Attributes (F2LA) dataset and manually annotate more than 10 attributes per face, including facial localization information. Utilizing the extensive annotations from F2LA, an experimental setup is designed to study the performance of four pre-trained face detectors. We observe (i) a high disparity in detection accuracies across gender and skin-tone, and (ii) interplay of confounding factors beyond demography.

Analyzing them for social bias can thus provide valuable insights, such as prevailing stereotypes in society and the media, which are often adopted by NLP models trained on respective data.

However, several representation issues of embeddings can harm the measures' accuracy, including low-resource settings and token frequency differences. In this work, we study what kind of embedding algorithm serves best to accurately measure types of social bias known to exist in US online news articles. To cover the whole spectrum of political bias in the US, we collect 500k articles and review psychology literature with respect to expected social bias. We then quantify social bias using WEAT along with embedding algorithms that account for the aforementioned issues. We compare how models trained with the algorithms on news articles represent the expected social bias. Our results suggest that the standard way to quantify bias does not align well with knowledge from psychology.

The hyperbolic geometry has been shown to capture the hierarchical patterns due to its tree-like metrics, which addressed the limitations of the Euclidean embedding models. Recent explorations of the complex hyperbolic geometry further improved the hyperbolic embeddings for capturing a variety of hierarchical structures. However, the performance of the hyperbolic KG embedding models for non-transitive relations is still unpromising, while the complex hyperbolic embeddings do not deal with multi-relations. This paper aims to utilize the representation capacity of the complex hyperbolic geometry in multi-relational KG embeddings. To apply the geometric transformations which account for different relations and the attention mechanism in the complex hyperbolic space, we propose to use the fast Fourier transform (FFT) as the conversion between the real and complex hyperbolic space. Constructing the attention-based transformations in the complex space is very challenging, while the proposed Fourier transform-based complex hyperbolic approaches provide a simple and effective solution. Experimental results show that our methods outperform the baselines, including the Euclidean and the real hyperbolic embedding models. ",

    "abstract": "Commonly used AI networks are very self-confident in their predictions, even when the evidence for a certain decision is dubious. The investigation of a deep learning model output is pivotal for understanding its decision processes and assessing its capabilities and limitations. By analyzing the distributions of raw network output vectors, it can be observed that each class has its own decision boundary and, thus, the same raw output value has different support for different classes. Inspired by this fact, we have developed a new method for out-of-distribution detection. The method offers an explanatory step beyond simple thresholding of the softmax output towards understanding and interpretation of the model learning process and its output. Instead of assigning the class label of the highest logit to each new sample presented to the network, it takes the distributions over all classes into consideration. A probability score interpreter (PSI) is created based on the joint logit values in relation to their respective correct vs wrong class distributions. The PSI suggests whether the sample is likely to belong to a specific class, whether the network is unsure, or whether the sample is likely an outlier or unknown type for the network. The simple PSI has the benefit of being applicable on already trained networks. The distributions for correct vs wrong class for each output node are established by simply running the training examples through the trained network. We demonstrate our OOD detection method on a challenging transmission electron microscopy virus image dataset. We simulate a real-world application in which images of virus types unknown to a trained virus classifier, yet acquired with the same procedures and instruments, constitute the OOD samples. ",

However, cross entropy loss is still needed to train the final classification layer. In this work, we investigate the possibility of learning both the representation and the classifier using one objective function that combines the robustness of contrastive learning and the probabilistic interpretation of cross entropy loss. First, we revisit a previously proposed contrastive-based objective function that approximates cross entropy loss and present a simple extension to learn the classifier jointly. Second, we propose a new version of the supervised contrastive training that learns jointly the parameters of the classifier and the backbone of the network. We empirically show that our proposed objective functions show a significant improvement over the standard cross entropy loss with more training stability and robustness in various challenging settings.

The aim is to find a tree in $G$ rooted at $r$ such that the total cost of its nodes is at most a given budget $B$ and the total prize is maximized. In the \\emph{quota rooted node-weighted Steiner tree} problem, we are given a real-valued quota $Q$, instead of the budget, and we aim at minimizing the cost of a tree rooted at $r$ whose overall prize is at least $Q$. For the case of directed graphs with additive prize function, we develop a technique resorting on a standard flow-based linear programming relaxation to compute a tree with good trade-off between prize and cost, which allows us to provide very simple polynomial time approximation algorithms for both the budgeted and the quota problems. For the \\emph{budgeted} problem, our algorithm achieves a bicriteria $(1+\\epsilon, O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^2}n^{2/3}\\ln{n}))$-approximation, for any $\\epsilon \\in (0, 1]$. For the \\emph{quota} problem, our algorithm guarantees a bicriteria approximation factor of $(2, O(n^{2/3}\\ln{n}))$. Next, by using the flow-based LP, we provide a surprisingly simple polynomial time $O((1+\\epsilon)\\sqrt{n} \\ln {n})$-approximation algorithm for the node-weighted version of directed Steiner tree problem, for any $\\epsilon>0$. For the case of undirected graphs with monotone submodular prize functions over subsets of nodes, we provide a polynomial time $O(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^3}\\sqrt{n}\\log{n})$-approximation algorithm for the budgeted problem that violates the budget constraint by a factor of at most $1+\\epsilon$, for any $\\epsilon \\in (0, 1]$. Our technique allows us to provide a good approximation also for the quota problem. ",

    "abstract": "Spintronic nano-synapses and nano-neurons perform complex cognitive computations with high accuracy thanks to their rich, reproducible and controllable magnetization dynamics. These dynamical nanodevices could transform artificial intelligence hardware, provided that they implement state-of-the art deep neural networks. However, there is today no scalable way to connect them in multilayers. Here we show that the flagship nano-components of spintronics, magnetic tunnel junctions, can be connected into multilayer neural networks where they implement both synapses and neurons thanks to their magnetization dynamics, and communicate by processing, transmitting and receiving radio frequency (RF) signals. We build a hardware spintronic neural network composed of nine magnetic tunnel junctions connected in two layers, and show that it natively classifies nonlinearly-separable RF inputs with an accuracy of 97.7%. Using physical simulations, we demonstrate that a large network of nanoscale junctions can achieve state-of the-art identification of drones from their RF transmissions, without digitization, and consuming only a few milliwatts, which is a gain of more than four orders of magnitude in power consumption compared to currently used techniques. This study lays the foundation for deep, dynamical, spintronic neural networks. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has shown impressive results in static scenes. It relies on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, however, that is violated in dynamic object regions and occlusions. Consequently, existing methods show poor accuracy in dynamic scenes, and the estimated depth map is blurred at object boundaries because they are usually occluded in other training views. In this paper, we propose SC-DepthV3 for addressing the challenges. Specifically, we introduce an external pretrained monocular depth estimation model for generating single-image depth prior, namely pseudo-depth, based on which we propose novel losses to boost self-supervised training. As a result, our model can predict sharp and accurate depth maps, even when training from monocular videos of highly-dynamic scenes. We demonstrate the significantly superior performance of our method over previous methods on six challenging datasets, and we provide detailed ablation studies for the proposed terms.

    "abstract": "With the advancement in technology, digital images can easily be transmitted and stored over the Internet. Encryption is used to avoid illegal interception of digital images. Encrypting large-sized colour images in their original dimension generally results in low encryption/decryption speed along with exerting a burden on the limited bandwidth of the transmission channel. To address the aforementioned issues, a new encryption scheme for colour images employing convolutional autoencoder, DNA and chaos is presented in this paper. The proposed scheme has two main modules, the dimensionality conversion module using the proposed convolutional autoencoder, and the encryption/decryption module using DNA and chaos. The dimension of the input colour image is first reduced from N $\\times$ M $\\times$ 3 to P $\\times$ Q gray-scale image using the encoder. Encryption and decryption are then performed in the reduced dimension space. The decrypted gray-scale image is upsampled to obtain the original colour image having dimension N $\\times$ M $\\times$ 3. The training and validation accuracy of the proposed autoencoder is 97% and 95%, respectively. Once the autoencoder is trained, it can be used to reduce and subsequently increase the dimension of any arbitrary input colour image. The efficacy of the designed autoencoder has been demonstrated by the successful reconstruction of the compressed image into the original colour image with negligible perceptual distortion. The second major contribution presented in this paper is an image encryption scheme using DNA along with multiple chaotic sequences and substitution boxes. The security of the proposed image encryption algorithm has been gauged using several evaluation parameters, such as histogram of the cipher image, entropy, NPCR, UACI, key sensitivity, contrast, etc. encryption.

Multiple applications, especially in chemistry and novel drug discovery, encourage rapid development of machine learning models in this area. To keep up with the pace of new research, proper experimental design, fair evaluation, and independent benchmarks are essential. Design of strong baselines is an indispensable element of such works. In this thesis, we explore multiple approaches to graph classification. We focus on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which emerged as a de facto standard deep learning technique for graph representation learning. Classical approaches, such as graph descriptors and molecular fingerprints, are also addressed. We design fair evaluation experimental protocol and choose proper datasets collection. This allows us to perform numerous experiments and rigorously analyze modern approaches. We arrive to many conclusions, which shed new light on performance and quality of novel algorithms. We investigate application of Jumping Knowledge GNN architecture to graph classification, which proves to be an efficient tool for improving base graph neural network architectures. Multiple improvements to baseline models are also proposed and experimentally verified, which constitutes an important contribution to the field of fair model comparison. ",

Our contributions include deriving a generalized likelihood-ratio test (GLRT) detector to decide if the antenna impedance has changed over two groups of packets. This GLRT formulation leads to a novel optimization problem, but we propose a binary search based algorithm to solve it efficiently. Our derived GLRT detector enjoys a better detection and false alarm trade-off when compared with a well-known, reference detector in simulations. As one result, more transmit diversity significantly improves detection accuracy at a given false alarm rate, especially in slow fading channels. ",

For addressing occluded ReID, part-based methods have been shown beneficial as they offer fine-grained information and are well suited to represent partially visible human bodies. However, training a part-based model is a challenging task for two reasons. Firstly, individual body part appearance is not as discriminative as global appearance (two distinct IDs might have the same local appearance), this means standard ReID training objectives using identity labels are not adapted to local feature learning. Secondly, ReID datasets are not provided with human topographical annotations. In this work, we propose BPBreID, a body part-based ReID model for solving the above issues. We first design two modules for predicting body part attention maps and producing body part-based features of the ReID target. We then propose GiLt, a novel training scheme for learning part-based representations that is robust to occlusions and non-discriminative local appearance. Extensive experiments on popular holistic and occluded datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 0.7% mAP and 5.6% rank-1 accuracy on the challenging Occluded-Duke dataset.

We show that this is an ordinal potential game and that the best response correspondence always exhibits a local structure in that it is never convenient for a node to link to other nodes that are at incoming distance more than $d_i $ from her. We then study the equilibria of this game determining necessary conditions for a graph to be a (strict, recurrent) Nash equilibrium. Moreover, in the special cases where for all players $ d_i=1 $ or $ d_i=2 $, we provide a complete classification of the set of (strict, recurrent) Nash equilibria. Our analysis shows in particular that the considered formation mechanism leads to the emergence of undirected and disconnected or loosely connected networks. ",

We consider the problem setting in which a remote station seeks to identify anomalies using system input-output signals transmitted over communication networks. However, in such a networked setting, it is not desired to disclose true data of the system operation as it can be used to infer private information -- modeled here as a system private output. To prevent accurate estimation of private outputs by adversaries, we pass original signals through distorting (privacy-preserving) mechanisms and send the distorted data to the remote station (which inevitably leads to degraded monitoring performance). The design of these mechanisms is formulated as a privacy-utility (tradeoff) problem where system utility is characterized by anomaly detection performance, and privacy is quantified using information-theoretic metrics (mutual information and differential entropy). We cast the synthesis of dependent Gaussian mechanisms as the solution of a convex program (log-determinant cost with linear matrix inequality constraints) where we seek to maximize privacy over a finite window of realizations while guaranteeing a bound on monitoring performance degradation. We provide simulation results to illustrate the performance of the developed tools. ",

Importantly, instead of explicitly sampling augmentations from latent distributions, we further propose an upper bound for the expected contrastive loss to improve the efficiency of our learning algorithm. Thus, graph semantics can be preserved within the augmentations in an intelligent way without arbitrary manual design or prior human knowledge. Experimental results on both graph-level and node-level tasks show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other benchmarks, where ablation studies in the end demonstrate the effectiveness of modules in iGCL.

However, operating networks adaptively is algorithmically challenging, as meeting networks' stringent dependability requirements relies on maintaining basic consistency and performance properties, such as loop freedom and congestion minimization, even during the update process. This paper leverages an augmentation-speed tradeoff to significantly speed up consistent network updates. We show that allowing for a small and short (hence practically tolerable, e.g., using buffering) oversubscription of links allows us to solve many network update instances much faster, as well as to reduce computational complexities (i.e., the running times of the algorithms). We first explore this tradeoff formally, revealing the computational complexity of scheduling updates. We then present and analyze algorithms that maintain logical and performance properties during the update. Using an extensive simulation study, we find that the tradeoff is even more favorable in practice than our analytical bounds suggest. In particular, we find that by allowing just 10% augmentation, update times reduce by more than 32% on average, across a spectrum of real-world networks. ",

We obtain tight bounds for this problem under almost all parameter regimes.

Our results demonstrate interesting phase transitions for $m$ and the privacy parameter $\\varepsilon$ in the estimation risk.

    "abstract": "The success of AlphaZero (AZ) has demonstrated that neural-network-based Go AIs can surpass human performance by a large margin. Given that the state space of Go is extremely large and a human player can play the game from any legal state, we ask whether adversarial states exist for Go AIs that may lead them to play surprisingly wrong actions. In this paper, we first extend the concept of adversarial examples to the game of Go: we generate perturbed states that are ``semantically'' equivalent to the original state by adding meaningless moves to the game, and an adversarial state is a perturbed state leading to an undoubtedly inferior action that is obvious even for Go beginners. However, searching the adversarial state is challenging due to the large, discrete, and non-differentiable search space. To tackle this challenge, we develop the first adversarial attack on Go AIs that can efficiently search for adversarial states by strategically reducing the search space. This method can also be extended to other board games such as NoGo. Experimentally, we show that the actions taken by both Policy-Value neural network (PV-NN) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) can be misled by adding one or two meaningless stones; for example, on 58\\% of the AlphaGo Zero self-play games, our method can make the widely used KataGo agent with 50 simulations of MCTS plays a losing action by adding two meaningless stones. We additionally evaluated the adversarial examples found by our algorithm with amateur human Go players and 90\\% of examples indeed lead the Go agent to play an obviously inferior action.

Despite the promise of leveraging near- to intermediate-term quantum resources to accelerate this task, the computational advantage of VQAs over wholly classical algorithms has not been firmly established. For instance, while the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) has been developed to approximate low-lying eigenmodes of high-dimensional sparse linear operators, analogous classical optimization algorithms exist in the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) literature, utilizing neural networks in place of quantum circuits to represent quantum states. In this paper we ask if classical stochastic optimization algorithms can be constructed paralleling other VQAs, focusing on the example of the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS). We find that such a construction can be applied to the VQLS, yielding a paradigm that could theoretically extend to other VQAs of similar form. ",

    "abstract": "High order structures (cavities and cliques) of the gene network of influenza A virus reveal tight associations among viruses during evolution and are key signals that indicate viral cross-species infection and cause pandemics. As indicators for sensing the dynamic changes of viral genes, these higher order structures have been the focus of attention in the field of virology. However, the size of the viral gene network is usually huge, and searching these structures in the networks introduces unacceptable delay. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we propose a simple-yet-effective model named HyperSearch based on deep learning to search cavities in a computable complex network for influenza virus genetics. Extensive experiments conducted on a public influenza virus dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HyperSearch over other advanced deep-learning methods without any elaborated model crafting. Moreover, HyperSearch can finish the search works in minutes while 0-1 programming takes days. Since the proposed method is simple and easy to be transferred to other complex networks, HyperSearch has the potential to facilitate the monitoring of dynamic changes in viral genes and help humans keep up with the pace of virus mutations.

High-throughput drug screens can be performed on larval zebrafish in multi-well plates by observing changes in behaviour following a treatment.

Statistical analysis of individual statistics (such as the distance travelled) is generally not powerful enough to detect meaningful differences between treatment groups. Here, we propose a method for classifying zebrafish models of Parkinson's disease by genotype at 5 days old. Using a set of 2D behavioural features, we train a multi-layer perceptron neural network. We further show that the use of integrated gradients can give insight into the impact of each behaviour feature on genotype classifications by the model. In this way, we provide a novel pipeline for classifying zebrafish larvae, beginning with feature preparation and ending with an impact analysis of said features. ",

    "abstract": "Autoencoders are widely used in outlier detection due to their superiority in handling high-dimensional and nonlinear datasets. The reconstruction of any dataset by the autoencoder can be considered as a complex regression process. In regression analysis, outliers can usually be divided into high leverage points and influential points. Although the autoencoder has shown good results for the identification of influential points, there are still some problems when detect high leverage points. Through theoretical derivation, we found that most outliers are detected in the direction corresponding to the worst-recovered principal component, but in the direction of the well-recovered principal components, the anomalies are often ignored. We propose a new loss function which solve the above deficiencies in outlier detection. The core idea of our scheme is that in order to better detect high leverage points, we should suppress the complete reconstruction of the dataset to convert high leverage points into influential points, and it is also necessary to ensure that the differences between the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the original dataset and their corresponding reconstructed results in the direction of each principal component are equal. Besides, we explain the rationality of our scheme through rigorous theoretical derivation. Finally, our experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our scheme significantly improves the accuracy of outlier detection. ",

    "abstract": "The pattern of pedestrian crashes varies greatly depending on lighting circumstances, emphasizing the need of examining pedestrian crashes in various lighting conditions. Using Louisiana pedestrian fatal and injury crash data (2010-2019), this study applied Association Rules Mining (ARM) to identify the hidden pattern of crash risk factors according to three different lighting conditions (daylight, dark-with-streetlight, and dark-no-streetlight). Based on the generated rules, the results show that daylight pedestrian crashes are associated with children (less than 15 years), senior pedestrians (greater than 64 years), older drivers (>64 years), and other driving behaviors such as failure to yield, inattentive/distracted, illness/fatigue/asleep. Additionally, young drivers (15-24 years) are involved in severe pedestrian crashes in daylight conditions. This study also found pedestrian alcohol/drug involvement as the most frequent item in the dark-with-streetlight condition. This crash type is particularly associated with pedestrian action (crossing intersection/midblock), driver age (55-64 years), speed limit (30-35 mph), and specific area type (business with mixed residential area). Fatal pedestrian crashes are found to be associated with roadways with high-speed limits (>50 mph) during the dark without streetlight condition. Some other risk factors linked with high-speed limit related crashes are pedestrians walking with/against the traffic, presence of pedestrian dark clothing, pedestrian alcohol/drug involvement. The research findings are expected to provide an improved understanding of the underlying relationships between pedestrian crash risk factors and specific lighting conditions. Highway safety experts can utilize these findings to conduct a decision-making process for selecting effective countermeasures to reduce pedestrian crashes strategically. ",

The actual state of the art consists in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) (Bapst 2020) which, beside having a great expressive power, are heavy models with numerous parameters and lack interpretability. Inspired by recent advances (Thomas 2018), we build a GNN that learns a robust representation of the glass' static structure by constraining it to preserve the roto-translation (SE(3)) equivariance. We show that this constraint not only significantly improves the predictive power but also allows to reduce the number of parameters while improving the interpretability.

    "abstract": "Geological carbon storage represents one of the few truly scalable technologies capable of reducing the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. While this technology has the potential to scale, its success hinges on our ability to mitigate its risks. An important aspect of risk mitigation concerns assurances that the injected CO2 remains within the storage complex. Amongst the different monitoring modalities, seismic imaging stands out with its ability to attain high resolution and high fidelity images. However, these superior features come, unfortunately, at prohibitive costs and time-intensive efforts potentially rendering extensive seismic monitoring undesirable. To overcome this shortcoming, we present a methodology where time-lapse images are created by inverting non-replicated time-lapse monitoring data jointly. By no longer insisting on replication of the surveys to obtain high fidelity time-lapse images and differences, extreme costs and time-consuming labor are averted. To demonstrate our approach, hundreds of noisy time-lapse seismic datasets are simulated that contain imprints of regular CO2 plumes and irregular plumes that leak. These time-lapse datasets are subsequently inverted to produce time-lapse difference images used to train a deep neural classifier. The testing results show that the classifier is capable of detecting CO2 leakage automatically on unseen data and with a reasonable accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Latent variable models such as the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) have become a go-to tool for analyzing biological data, especially in the field of single-cell genomics. One remaining challenge is the interpretability of latent variables as biological processes that define a cell's identity. Outside of biological applications, this problem is commonly referred to as learning disentangled representations. Although several disentanglement-promoting variants of the VAE were introduced and applied to single-cell genomics data, this task has been shown to be infeasible from independent and identically distributed measurements, without additional structure. Instead, recent methods propose to leverage non-stationary data, as well as the sparse mechanism shift assumption in order to learn disentangled representations with a causal semantic. Here, we extend the application of these methodological advances to the analysis of single-cell genomics data with genetic or chemical perturbations. More precisely, we propose a deep generative model of single-cell gene expression data for which each perturbation is treated as a stochastic intervention targeting an unknown, but sparse, subset of latent variables. We benchmark these methods on simulated single-cell data to evaluate their performance at latent units recovery, causal target identification and out-of-domain generalization. Finally, we apply those approaches to two real-world large-scale gene perturbation data sets and find that models that exploit the sparse mechanism shift hypothesis surpass contemporary methods on a transfer learning task.

Then, we propose a new first-order stochastic method, AskewSGD, to solve each constrained optimization subproblem.

The numerical complexity of AskewSGD is comparable to existing approaches for training QNNs, such as the straight-through gradient estimator used in BinaryConnect, or other state of the art methods (ProxQuant, LUQ). We establish convergence guarantees for AskewSGD (under general assumptions for the objective function).
