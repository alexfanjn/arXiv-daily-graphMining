    "abstract": "Network architectures and learning principles are playing key in forming complex functions in artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs are considered the new-generation artificial networks by incorporating more biological features than ANNs, including dynamic spiking neurons, functionally specified architectures, and efficient learning paradigms. Network architectures are also considered embodying the function of the network. Here, we propose a Motif-topology improved SNN (M-SNN) for the efficient multi-sensory integration and cognitive phenomenon simulations. The cognitive phenomenon simulation we simulated includes the cocktail party effect and McGurk effect, which are discussed by many researchers. Our M-SNN constituted by the meta operator called network motifs. The source of 3-node network motifs topology from artificial one pre-learned from the spatial or temporal dataset. In the single-sensory classification task, the results showed the accuracy of M-SNN using network motif topologies was higher than the pure feedforward network topology without using them. In the multi-sensory integration task, the performance of M-SNN using artificial network motif was better than the state-of-the-art SNN using BRP (biologically-plausible reward propagation). Furthermore, the M-SNN could better simulate the cocktail party effect and McGurk effect with lower computational cost. We think the artificial network motifs could be considered as some prior knowledge that would contribute to the multi-sensory integration of SNNs and provide more benefits for simulating the cognitive phenomenon.

    "abstract": "Modern IT system operation demands the integration of system software and hardware metrics. As a result, it generates a massive amount of data, which can be potentially used to make data-driven operational decisions. In the basic form, the decision model needs to monitor a large set of machine data, such as CPU utilization, allocated memory, disk and network latency, and predicts the system metrics to prevent performance degradation. Nevertheless, building an effective prediction model in this scenario is rather challenging as the model has to accurately capture the long-range coupling dependency in the Multivariate Time-Series (MTS). Moreover, this model needs to have low computational complexity and can scale efficiently to the dimension of data available. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient model named HigeNet to predict the long-time sequence time series. We have deployed the HigeNet on production in the D-matrix platform. We also provide offline evaluations on several publicly available datasets as well as one online dataset to demonstrate the model's efficacy. The extensive experiments show that training time, resource usage and accuracy of the model are found to be significantly better than five state-of-the-art competing models. ",

    "abstract": "Diabetes Mellitus, one of the leading causes of death worldwide, has no cure till date and can lead to severe health complications, such as retinopathy, limb amputation, cardiovascular diseases, and neuronal disease, if left untreated. Consequently, it becomes crucial to take precautionary measures to avoid/predict the occurrence of diabetes. Machine learning approaches have been proposed and evaluated in the literature for diabetes prediction. This paper proposes an IoT-edge-Artificial Intelligence (AI)-blockchain system for diabetes prediction based on risk factors. The proposed system is underpinned by the blockchain to obtain a cohesive view of the risk factors data from patients across different hospitals and to ensure security and privacy of the user data. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis of different medical sensors, devices, and methods to measure and collect the risk factors values in the system. Numerical experiments and comparative analysis were carried out between our proposed system, using the most accurate random forest (RF) model, and the two most used state-of-the-art machine learning approaches, Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), using three real-life diabetes datasets. The results show that the proposed system using RF predicts diabetes with 4.57% more accuracy on average compared to LR and SVM, with 2.87 times more execution time. Data balancing without feature selection does not show significant improvement. The performance is improved by 1.14% and 0.02% after feature selection for PIMA Indian and Sylhet datasets respectively, while it reduces by 0.89% for MIMIC III. ",

Nevertheless, the adoption of AI in power systems is still limited, while integration of AI particularly into distribution grid investment planning is still an uncharted territory. We make the first step forward to bridge this gap by showing how graph convolutional networks coupled with the hyperstructures representation learning framework can be employed for accurate, reliable, and computationally efficient distribution grid planning with resilience objectives. We further propose a Hyperstructures Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (Hyper-GCNNs) to capture hidden higher order representations of distribution networks with attention mechanism. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed Hyper-GCNNs approach yields substantial gains in computational efficiency compared to the prevailing methodology in distribution grid planning and also noticeably outperforms seven state-of-the-art models from deep learning (DL) community.

In the paper, we propose a new interpretable neural network method, by embedding neurons into the semantic space to extract their intrinsic global semantics. In contrast to previous methods that probe latent knowledge inside the model, the proposed semantic vector externalizes the latent knowledge to static knowledge, which is easy to exploit. Specifically, we assume that neurons with similar activation are of similar semantic information. Afterwards, semantic vectors are optimized by continuously aligning activation similarity and semantic vector similarity during the training of the neural network. The visualization of semantic vectors allows for a qualitative explanation of the neural network. Moreover, we assess the static knowledge quantitatively by knowledge distillation tasks. Empirical experiments of visualization show that semantic vectors describe neuron activation semantics well. Without the sample-by-sample guidance from the teacher model, static knowledge distillation exhibit comparable or even superior performance with existing relation-based knowledge distillation methods.

    "abstract": "There is a growing body of work that leverages features extracted via topological data analysis to train machine learning models. While this field, sometimes known as topological machine learning (TML), has seen some notable successes, an understanding of how the process of learning from topological features differs from the process of learning from raw data is still limited. In this work, we begin to address one component of this larger issue by asking whether a model trained with topological features learns internal representations of data that are fundamentally different than those learned by a model trained with the original raw data. To quantify ``different'', we exploit two popular metrics that can be used to measure the similarity of the hidden representations of data within neural networks, neural stitching and centered kernel alignment. From these we draw a range of conclusions about how training with topological features does and does not change the representations that a model learns. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we find that structurally, the hidden representations of models trained and evaluated on topological features differ substantially compared to those trained and evaluated on the corresponding raw data. On the other hand, our experiments show that in some cases, these representations can be reconciled (at least to the degree required to solve the corresponding task) using a simple affine transformation. We conjecture that this means that neural networks trained on raw data may extract some limited topological features in the process of making predictions. ",

Profitable headlines pique readers' interest and encourage them to visit a specific website. This is usually done by adding an element of dishonesty, using enticements that do not precisely reflect the content being delivered. As a result, automatic detection of incongruent news between headline and body content using language analysis has gained the research community's attention. However, various solutions are primarily being developed for English to address this problem, leaving low-resource languages out of the picture. Bangla is ranked 7th among the top 100 most widely spoken languages, which motivates us to pay special attention to the Bangla language. Furthermore, Bangla has a more complex syntactic structure and fewer natural language processing resources, so it becomes challenging to perform NLP tasks like incongruity detection and stance detection. To tackle this problem, for the Bangla language, we offer a graph-based hierarchical dual encoder (BGHDE) model that learns the content similarity and contradiction between Bangla news headlines and content paragraphs effectively. The experimental results show that the proposed Bangla graph-based neural network model achieves above 90% accuracy on various Bangla news datasets. ",

Our model uses a Depression Symptoms Detection (DSD) model, which is trained on the largest existing samples of clinician annotated tweets for clinical depression symptoms. We subsequently use our DSD model to extract clinically relevant features, e.g., depression scores and their consequent temporal patterns, as well as user posting activity patterns, e.g., quantifying their ``no activity'' or ``silence.'' Furthermore, to evaluate the efficacy of these extracted features, we create three kinds of datasets including a test dataset, from two existing well-known benchmark datasets for user-level depression detection. We then provide accuracy measures based on single features, baseline features and feature ablation tests, at several different levels of temporal granularity, data distributions, and clinical depression detection related settings to draw a complete picture of the impact of these features across our created datasets. Finally, we show that, in general, only semantic oriented representation models perform well. However, clinical features may enhance overall performance provided that the training and testing distribution is similar, and there is more data in a user's timeline. Further, we show that the predictive capability of depression scores increase significantly while used in a more sensitive clinical depression detection settings. ",

Currently, the state-of-the-art in unsupervised out-of-distribution detection is dominated by generative-based approaches that make use of estimates of the likelihood or other measurements from a generative model. Reconstruction-based methods offer an alternative approach, in which a measure of reconstruction error is used to determine if a sample is out-of-distribution. However, reconstruction-based approaches are less favoured, as they require careful tuning of the model's information bottleneck - such as the size of the latent dimension - to produce good results. In this work, we exploit the view of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) as denoising autoencoders where the bottleneck is controlled externally, by means of the amount of noise applied. We propose to use DDPMs to reconstruct an input that has been noised to a range of noise levels, and use the resulting multi-dimensional reconstruction error to classify out-of-distribution inputs. Our approach outperforms not only reconstruction-based methods, but also state-of-the-art generative-based approaches. ",

However, multiple spiking neuron models have been proposed in the literature with different levels of biological plausibility and different computational features and complexities.

In this context, we explore the impact of synaptic and membrane leakages in spiking neurons. We confront three neural models with different computational complexities using feedforward and recurrent topologies for event-based visual and auditory pattern recognition. Our results show that, in terms of accuracy, leakages are important when there are both temporal information in the data and explicit recurrence in the network. In addition, leakages do not necessarily increase the sparsity of spikes flowing in the network. We also investigate the impact of heterogeneity in the time constant of leakages, and the results show a slight improvement in accuracy when using data with a rich temporal structure. These results advance our understanding of the computational role of the neural leakages and network recurrences, and provide valuable insights for the design of compact and energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware for embedded systems.

We demonstrate using a numerical example that meta-learning can result in more accurate neural SSM models than supervised- or transfer-learning, despite few adaptation steps and limited online data. Additionally, we show that by carefully partitioning and adapting the encoder layers while fixing the state-transition operator, we can achieve comparable performance to MAML while reducing online adaptation complexity.

With the rapid rise of deep neural networks (DNNs), a trade-off between performance (i.e., accuracy) and computational efficiency has become a very significant issue. Whereas an end-to-end DNN-based CM model exhibits high performance, it becomes virtually infeasible on very large puzzles, due to its highly intensive computation. On the other hand, exploiting the concept of embeddings to alleviate significantly the computational efficiency, has resulted in degraded performance, according to recent studies. This paper derives an advanced CM model (based on modified embeddings and a new loss function, called hard batch triplet loss) for closing the above gap between speed and accuracy; namely a CM model that achieves SOTA results in terms of performance and efficiency combined. We evaluated our newly derived CM on three commonly used datasets, and obtained a reconstruction improvement of 5.8% and 19.5% for so-called Type-1 and Type-2 problem variants, respectively, compared to best known results due to previous CMs. ",

First, we introduce a new criterion to reliably estimate model confidence: the true class probability (TCP). We show that TCP offers better properties for failure prediction than current uncertainty measures. Since the true class is by essence unknown at test time, we propose to learn TCP criterion from data with an auxiliary model, introducing a specific learning scheme adapted to this context. The relevance of the proposed approach is validated on image classification and semantic segmentation datasets. Then, we extend our learned confidence approach to the task of domain adaptation where it improves the selection of pseudo-labels in self-training methods. Finally, we tackle the challenge of jointly detecting misclassification and out-of-distributions samples by introducing a new uncertainty measure based on evidential models and defined on the simplex.

In this paper, we investigate the performance and internal representational structure of convolution-based neural networks (e.g., ResNets) trained on biased data using various objective functions. We specifically study similarities in representations, using Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), for different objective functions (probabilistic and margin-based) and offer a comprehensive analysis of the chosen ones. According to our findings, ResNets representations obtained with Negative Log Likelihood $(\\mathcal{L}_{NLL})$ and Softmax Cross-Entropy ($\\mathcal{L}_{SCE}$) as loss functions are equally capable of producing better performance and fine representations on biased data. We note that without progressive representational similarities among the layers of a neural network, the performance is less likely to be robust. ",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel energy storage price arbitrage algorithm combining supervised learning with dynamic programming. The proposed approach uses a neural network to directly predicts the opportunity cost at different energy storage state-of-charge levels, and then input the predicted opportunity cost into a model-based arbitrage control algorithm for optimal decisions. We generate the historical optimal opportunity value function using price data and a dynamic programming algorithm, then use it as the ground truth and historical price as predictors to train the opportunity value function prediction model. Our method achieves 65% to 90% profit compared to perfect foresight in case studies using different energy storage models and price data from New York State, which significantly outperforms existing model-based and learning-based methods. While guaranteeing high profitability, the algorithm is also light-weighted and can be trained and implemented with minimal computational cost. Our results also show that the learned prediction model has excellent transferability. The prediction model trained using price data from one region also provides good arbitrage results when tested over other regions. ",

We show that within this extended framework, we can construct non-proportional hazard models, which we call TimeNAM, that significantly improve performance over the standard NAM model architecture on benchmark survival datasets.

In this paper, we consider the presence of malicious players (or attackers) who obstruct the cooperative players (or defenders) from maximizing their rewards, by deliberately colliding with them. We provide the first decentralized and robust algorithm RESYNC for defenders whose performance deteriorates gracefully as $\\tilde{O}(C)$ as the number of collisions $C$ from the attackers increases. We show that this algorithm is order-optimal by proving a lower bound which scales as $\\Omega(C)$.

    "abstract": "The decoupled Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), a recent development of GCN that decouples the neighborhood aggregation and feature transformation in each convolutional layer, has shown promising performance for graph representation learning. Existing decoupled GCNs first utilize a simple neural network (e.g., MLP) to learn the hidden features of the nodes, then propagate the learned features on the graph with fixed steps to aggregate the information of multi-hop neighborhoods. Despite effectiveness, the aggregation operation, which requires the whole adjacency matrix as the input, is involved in the model training, causing high training cost that hinders its potential on larger graphs. On the other hand, due to the independence of node attributes as the input, the neural networks used in decoupled GCNs are very simple, and advanced techniques cannot be applied to the modeling. To this end, we further liberate the aggregation operation from the decoupled GCN and propose a new paradigm of GCN, termed Neighborhood Convolutional Network (NCN), that utilizes the neighborhood aggregation result as the input, followed by a special convolutional neural network tailored for extracting expressive node representations from the aggregation input. In this way, the model could inherit the merit of decoupled GCN for aggregating neighborhood information, at the same time, develop much more powerful feature learning modules. A training strategy called mask training is incorporated to further boost the model performance. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for the node classification task on diverse homophilic graphs and heterophilic graphs. ",

This local magnification results in geometric changes that significantly broaden the range of augmentations while maintaining the recognizability of objects. Moreover, we extend the idea of LOMA and random cropping to the feature space to augment the feature map, which further boosts the classification accuracy considerably. Experiments show that our proposed LOMA, though straightforward, can be combined with standard data augmentation to significantly improve the performance on image classification and object detection. And further combination with our feature augmentation techniques, termed LOMA_IF&FO, can continue to strengthen the model and outperform advanced intensity transformation methods for data augmentation.

    "abstract": "Future satellite networks are expected to have thousands of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites orbiting Earth at very high speeds. User equipment (UE) communicating directly with LEO satellites will experience frequent handovers. Managing the handover process is complicated due to the high frequency of handovers and the availability of multiple LEO satellites as handover targets. In addition, as the status of the communication link between a UE and an LEO satellite varies in accordance with the visibility period of the satellite, initiating handovers at the right time will significantly affect the quality of service (QoS) of the communication provided. To address this problem, this work proposes a graph-based customizable handover framework that considers both the handover timing and target while selecting a handover sequence that maintains QoS. A time-based graph is designed where the vertices represent the satellites' instances over a certain period of time and the edges' weights are the customizable handover criteria (i.e., data rate and delay in this work). The appropriate sequence and timing of handovers that fulfill the required QoS are obtained by finding the shortest path in the graph. Discussion and simulations, which were conducted on the Starlink Phase I constellation, show the low complexity and performance advantages of the proposed handover framework. ",

However, the authenticity of perception data is not ensured, because the vehicles cannot independently verify the event they did not see. Many methods, including trust-based (i.e., statistical) approaches and plausibility-based methods, have been proposed to determine data authenticity. However, these methods cannot verify data without a priori knowledge. In this study, a novel approach of constructing a self-proving data from the number plate of target vehicles was proposed. By regarding the pseudonym and number plate as a shared secret and letting multiple vehicles prove they know it independently, the data authenticity problem can be transformed to a cryptography problem that can be solved without trust or plausibility evaluations. Our work can be adapted to the existing works including ETSI/ISO ITS standards while maintaining backward compatibility. Analyses of common attacks and attacks specific to the proposed method reveal that most attacks can be prevented, whereas preventing some other attacks, such as collusion attacks, can be mitigated.

This is a challenging task due to large deformations and missing correspondences between pre-operative and follow-up scans. For this task, we adopt our recently proposed Non-Iterative Coarse-to-finE registration Networks (NICE-Net) - a deep learning-based method for coarse-to-fine registering images with large deformations. To overcome missing correspondences, we extend the NICE-Net by introducing dual deep supervision, where a deep self-supervised loss based on image similarity and a deep weakly-supervised loss based on manually annotated landmarks are deeply embedded into the NICE-Net. At the BraTS-Reg 2022, our method achieved a competitive result on the validation set (mean absolute error: 3.387) and placed 4th in the final testing phase (Score: 0.3544). ",

We use an adversarial model to generate masks as augmentations for 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) data, where masks learn to occlude diagnostically-relevant regions of the ECGs. Compared to random augmentations, adversarial masking reaches better accuracy when transferring to to two diverse downstream objectives: arrhythmia classification and gender classification.

    "abstract": "When performing real-time learning tasks, the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) is expected to make full use of the training samples such that its learning accuracy and generalization capability are guaranteed. Since the approximation capability of the RBFNN is finite, training methods with forgetting mechanisms such as the forgetting factor recursive least squares (FFRLS) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods are widely used to maintain the learning ability of the RBFNN to new knowledge. However, with the forgetting mechanisms, some useful knowledge will get lost simply because they are learned a long time ago, which we refer to as the passive knowledge forgetting phenomenon. To address this problem, this paper proposes a real-time training method named selective memory recursive least squares (SMRLS) in which the feature space of the RBFNN is evenly discretized into a finite number of partitions and a synthesized objective function is developed to replace the original objective function of the ordinary recursive least squares (RLS) method. SMRLS is featured with a memorization mechanism that synthesizes the samples within each partition in real-time into representative samples uniformly distributed over the feature space, and thus overcomes the passive knowledge forgetting phenomenon and improves the generalization capability of the learned knowledge. Compared with the SGD or FFRLS methods, SMRLS achieves improved learning performance (learning speed, accuracy and generalization capability), which is demonstrated by corresponding simulation results.

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks have emerged as one of the major security threats to deep learning models as they can easily control the model's test-time predictions by pre-injecting a backdoor trigger into the model at training time. While backdoor attacks have been extensively studied on images, few works have investigated the threat of backdoor attacks on time series data. To fill this gap, in this paper we present a novel generative approach for time series backdoor attacks against deep learning based time series classifiers. Backdoor attacks have two main goals: high stealthiness and high attack success rate. We find that, compared to images, it can be more challenging to achieve the two goals on time series. This is because time series have fewer input dimensions and lower degrees of freedom, making it hard to achieve a high attack success rate without compromising stealthiness. Our generative approach addresses this challenge by generating trigger patterns that are as realistic as real-time series patterns while achieving a high attack success rate without causing a significant drop in clean accuracy. We also show that our proposed attack is resistant to potential backdoor defenses. Furthermore, we propose a novel universal generator that can poison any type of time series with a single generator that allows universal attacks without the need to fine-tune the generative model for new time series datasets.

In recent years, deep learning models, especially Long Short-Term Memory neural networks (LSTMs), have led to superior performances in such sequence representation learning tasks. Despite that some attention or self-attention based models with time-aware or feature-aware enhanced strategies have achieved better performance compared with other temporal modeling methods, such improvement is limited due to a lack of guidance from global view. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Hierarchical Global View-guided (HGV) sequence representation learning framework. Specifically, the Global Graph Embedding (GGE) module is proposed to learn sequential clip-aware representations from temporal correlation graph at instance level. Furthermore, following the way of key-query attention, the harmonic $\\beta$-attention ($\\beta$-Attn) is also developed for making a global trade-off between time-aware decay and observation significance at channel level adaptively. Moreover, the hierarchical representations at both instance level and channel level can be coordinated by the heterogeneous information aggregation under the guidance of global view. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset for healthcare risk prediction, and a real-world industrial scenario for Small and Mid-size Enterprises (SMEs) credit overdue risk prediction in MYBank, Ant Group, have illustrated that the proposed model can achieve competitive prediction performance compared with other known baselines.

    "abstract": "Recent methods for synthesizing 3D-aware face images have achieved rapid development thanks to neural radiance fields, allowing for high quality and fast inference speed. However, existing solutions for editing facial geometry and appearance independently usually require retraining and are not optimized for the recent work of generation, thus tending to lag behind the generation process. To address these issues, we introduce NeRFFaceEditing, which enables editing and decoupling geometry and appearance in the pretrained tri-plane-based neural radiance field while retaining its high quality and fast inference speed. Our key idea for disentanglement is to use the statistics of the tri-plane to represent the high-level appearance of its corresponding facial volume. Moreover, we leverage a generated 3D-continuous semantic mask as an intermediary for geometry editing. We devise a geometry decoder (whose output is unchanged when the appearance changes) and an appearance decoder. The geometry decoder aligns the original facial volume with the semantic mask volume. We also enhance the disentanglement by explicitly regularizing rendered images with the same appearance but different geometry to be similar in terms of color distribution for each facial component separately. Our method allows users to edit via semantic masks with decoupled control of geometry and appearance. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the superior geometry and appearance control abilities of our method compared to existing and alternative solutions. ",

    "abstract": "By incorporating the graph structural information into Transformers, graph Transformers have exhibited promising performance for graph representation learning in recent years. Existing graph Transformers leverage specific strategies, such as Laplacian eigenvectors and shortest paths of the node pairs, to preserve the structural features of nodes and feed them into the vanilla Transformer to learn the representations of nodes. It is hard for such predefined rules to extract informative graph structural features for arbitrary graphs whose topology structure varies greatly, limiting the learning capacity of the models. To this end, we propose an adaptive graph Transformer, termed Multi-Neighborhood Attention based Graph Transformer (MNA-GT), which captures the graph structural information for each node from the multi-neighborhood attention mechanism adaptively. By defining the input to perform scaled-dot product as an attention kernel, MNA-GT constructs multiple attention kernels based on different hops of neighborhoods such that each attention kernel can capture specific graph structural information of the corresponding neighborhood for each node pair. In this way, MNA-GT can preserve the graph structural information efficiently by incorporating node representations learned by different attention kernels. MNA-GT further employs an attention layer to learn the importance of different attention kernels to enable the model to adaptively capture the graph structural information for different nodes. Extensive experiments are conducted on a variety of graph benchmarks, and the empirical results show that MNA-GT outperforms many strong baselines. ",

    "title": "MORA: Improving Ensemble Robustness Evaluation with Model-Reweighing  Attack",
    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks can deceive neural networks by adding tiny perturbations to their input data. Ensemble defenses, which are trained to minimize attack transferability among sub-models, offer a promising research direction to improve robustness against such attacks while maintaining a high accuracy on natural inputs. We discover, however, that recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) adversarial attack strategies cannot reliably evaluate ensemble defenses, sizeably overestimating their robustness. This paper identifies the two factors that contribute to this behavior. First, these defenses form ensembles that are notably difficult for existing gradient-based method to attack, due to gradient obfuscation. Second, ensemble defenses diversify sub-model gradients, presenting a challenge to defeat all sub-models simultaneously, simply summing their contributions may counteract the overall attack objective; yet, we observe that ensemble may still be fooled despite most sub-models being correct. We therefore introduce MORA, a model-reweighing attack to steer adversarial example synthesis by reweighing the importance of sub-model gradients. MORA finds that recent ensemble defenses all exhibit varying degrees of overestimated robustness. Comparing it against recent SOTA white-box attacks, it can converge orders of magnitude faster while achieving higher attack success rates across all ensemble models examined with three different ensemble modes (i.e., ensembling by either softmax, voting or logits). In particular, most ensemble defenses exhibit near or exactly 0% robustness against MORA with $\\ell^\\infty$ perturbation within 0.02 on CIFAR-10, and 0.01 on CIFAR-100. We make MORA open source with reproducible results and pre-trained models; and provide a leaderboard of ensemble defenses under various attack strategies. ",

Due to the intrinsic permutation invariance of neural networks, Probabilistic Federated Neural Matching (PFNM) employs a Bayesian nonparametric framework in the generation process of local neurons, and then creates a linear sum assignment formulation in each alternative optimization iteration. But according to our theoretical analysis, the optimization iteration in PFNM omits global information from existing. In this study, we propose a novel approach that overcomes this flaw by introducing a Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty at each iteration.

These models can be used to estimate attributes of different neural network architectures such as the accuracy and latency, without running the actual training or inference tasks. In this paper, we propose a neural architecture representation model that can be used to estimate these attributes holistically. Specifically, we first propose a simple and effective tokenizer to encode both the operation and topology information of a neural network into a single sequence. Then, we design a multi-stage fusion transformer to build a compact vector representation from the converted sequence. For efficient model training, we further propose an information flow consistency augmentation and correspondingly design an architecture consistency loss, which brings more benefits with less augmentation samples compared with previous random augmentation strategies. Experiment results on NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, DARTS search space and NNLQP show that our proposed framework can be used to predict the aforementioned latency and accuracy attributes of both cell architectures and whole deep neural networks, and achieves promising performance.

Detecting emotion can help us in different fields, including opinion mining. With the spread of social media, different platforms like Twitter have become data sources, and the language used in these platforms is informal, making the emotion detection task difficult. EmoPars and ArmanEmo are two new human-labeled emotion datasets for the Persian language. These datasets, especially EmoPars, are suffering from inequality between several samples between two classes. In this paper, we evaluate EmoPars and compare them with ArmanEmo. Throughout this analysis, we use data augmentation techniques, data re-sampling, and class-weights with Transformer-based Pretrained Language Models(PLMs) to handle the imbalance problem of these datasets. Moreover, feature selection is used to enhance the models' performance by emphasizing the text's specific features. In addition, we provide a new policy for selecting data from EmoPars, which selects the high-confidence samples; as a result, the model does not see samples that do not have specific emotion during training. Our model reaches a Macro-averaged F1-score of 0.81 and 0.76 on ArmanEmo and EmoPars, respectively, which are new state-of-the-art results in these benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the great success of deep learning algorithms in the geoscience and remote sensing realm. Nevertheless, the security and robustness of deep learning models deserve special attention when addressing safety-critical remote sensing tasks. In this paper, we provide a systematic analysis of backdoor attacks for remote sensing data, where both scene classification and semantic segmentation tasks are considered. While most of the existing backdoor attack algorithms rely on visible triggers like squared patches with well-designed patterns, we propose a novel wavelet transform-based attack (WABA) method, which can achieve invisible attacks by injecting the trigger image into the poisoned image in the low-frequency domain. In this way, the high-frequency information in the trigger image can be filtered out in the attack, resulting in stealthy data poisoning. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method can significantly cheat the current state-of-the-art deep learning models with a high attack success rate. We further analyze how different trigger images and the hyper-parameters in the wavelet transform would influence the performance of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on four benchmark remote sensing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for both scene classification and semantic segmentation tasks and thus highlight the importance of designing advanced backdoor defense algorithms to address this threat in remote sensing scenarios.

Given the significant impact of supply voltages (VCCs) on power profiles, various countermeasures based on VCC tuning have been proposed, among other defense strategies. Driver strengths of cells, however, have been largely overlooked, despite having direct and significant impact on power profiles as well. For the first time, we thoroughly explore the prospects of jointly tuning driver strengths and VCCs as novel working principle for PSC-attack countermeasures. Toward this end, we take the following steps: 1) we develop a simple circuit-level scheme for tuning; 2) we implement a CAD flow for design-time evaluation of ASICs, enabling security assessment of ICs before tape-out; 3) we implement a correlation power analysis (CPA) framework for thorough and comparative security analysis; 4) we conduct an extensive experimental study of a regular AES design, implemented in ASIC as well as FPGA fabrics, under various tuning scenarios; 5) we summarize design guidelines for secure and efficient joint tuning. In our experiments, we observe that runtime tuning is more effective than static tuning, for both ASIC and FPGA implementations. For the latter, the AES core is rendered >11.8x (i.e., at least 11.8 times) as resilient as the untuned baseline design. Layout overheads can be considered acceptable, with, e.g., around +10% critical-path delay for the most resilient tuning scenario in FPGA. We will release source codes for our methodology, as well as artifacts from the experimental study, post peer-review. ",

Recently multi-modal fusion-based 3D object detection methods, which combine the complementary advantages of LiDAR and camera, have shown great performance improvements over mono-modal methods. However, so far, no methods have attempted to utilize the instance-level contextual image semantics to guide the 3D object detection. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective Painting Adaptive Instance-prior for 3D object detection (PAI3D) to fuse instance-level image semantics flexibly with point cloud features. PAI3D is a multi-modal sequential instance-level fusion framework. It first extracts instance-level semantic information from images, the extracted information, including objects categorical label, point-to-object membership and object position, are then used to augment each LiDAR point in the subsequent 3D detection network to guide and improve detection performance. PAI3D outperforms the state-of-the-art with a large margin on the nuScenes dataset, achieving 71.4 in mAP and 74.2 in NDS on the test split. Our comprehensive experiments show that instance-level image semantics contribute the most to the performance gain, and PAI3D works well with any good-quality instance segmentation models and any modern point cloud 3D encoders, making it a strong candidate for deployment on autonomous vehicles.

    "abstract": "Recent studies show that Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) are vulnerable and easily fooled by small perturbations, which has raised considerable concerns for adapting GNNs in various safety-critical applications. In this work, we focus on the emerging but critical attack, namely, Graph Injection Attack(GIA), in which the adversary poisons the graph by injecting fake nodes instead of modifying existing structures or node attributes. Inspired by findings that the adversarial attacks are related to the increased heterophily on perturbed graphs (the adversary tends to connect dissimilar nodes), we propose a general defense framework CHAGNN against GIA through cooperative homophilous augmentation of graph data and model. Specifically, the model generates pseudo-labels for unlabeled nodes in each round of training to reduce heterophilous edges of nodes with distinct labels. The cleaner graph is fed back to the model, producing more informative pseudo-labels. In such an iterative manner, model robustness is then promisingly enhanced. We present the theoretical analysis of the effect of homophilous augmentation and provide the guarantee of the proposal's validity. Experimental results empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of CHAGNN in comparison with recent state-of-the-art defense methods on diverse real-world datasets. ",

In this paper, we focus on the compression of DETR with knowledge distillation. While knowledge distillation has been well-studied in classic detectors, there is a lack of researches on how to make it work effectively on DETR. We first provide experimental and theoretical analysis to point out that the main challenge in DETR distillation is the lack of consistent distillation points. Distillation points refer to the corresponding inputs of the predictions for student to mimic, and reliable distillation requires sufficient distillation points which are consistent between teacher and student. Based on this observation, we propose a general knowledge distillation paradigm for DETR(KD-DETR) with consistent distillation points sampling. Specifically, we decouple detection and distillation tasks by introducing a set of specialized object queries to construct distillation points. In this paradigm, we further propose a general-to-specific distillation points sampling strategy to explore the extensibility of KD-DETR. Extensive experiments on different DETR architectures with various scales of backbones and transformer layers validate the effectiveness and generalization of KD-DETR. KD-DETR boosts the performance of DAB-DETR with ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 backbone to 41.4$\\%$, 45.7$\\%$ mAP, respectively, which are 5.2$\\%$, 3.5$\\%$ higher than the baseline, and ResNet-50 even surpasses the teacher model by $2.2\\%$.

It therefore appears intuitive that it is also a viable approach for distributed systems to save scarce shared network resources used for inter-agent communication. While this motivation is commonly used also for multi-agent systems, a theoretical analysis of the impact of network effects on the performance of event- and time-triggered control for such distributed systems is currently missing. With this paper, we contrast event- and time-triggered control performance for a single-integrator consensus problem under consideration of a shared communication medium. We therefore incorporate transmission delays and packet loss in our analysis and compare the triggering scheme performance under two simple medium access control protocols. We find that network effects can degrade the performance of event-triggered control beyond the performance level of time-triggered control for the same average triggering rate if the network is used intensively. Moreover, the performance advantage of event-triggered control shrinks with an increasing number of agents and is even lost for sufficiently large networks in the considered setup. ",

    "title": "Type Information Utilized Event Detection via Multi-Channel GNNs in  Electrical Power Systems",
    "abstract": "Event detection in power systems aims to identify triggers and event types, which helps relevant personnel respond to emergencies promptly and facilitates the optimization of power supply strategies. However, the limited length of short electrical record texts causes severe information sparsity, and numerous domain-specific terminologies of power systems makes it difficult to transfer knowledge from language models pre-trained on general-domain texts. Traditional event detection approaches primarily focus on the general domain and ignore these two problems in the power system domain. To address the above issues, we propose a Multi-Channel graph neural network utilizing Type information for Event Detection in power systems, named MC-TED, leveraging a semantic channel and a topological channel to enrich information interaction from short texts. Concretely, the semantic channel refines textual representations with semantic similarity, building the semantic information interaction among potential event-related words. The topological channel generates a relation-type-aware graph modeling word dependencies, and a word-type-aware graph integrating part-of-speech tags. To further reduce errors worsened by professional terminologies in type analysis, a type learning mechanism is designed for updating the representations of both the word type and relation type in the topological channel. In this way, the information sparsity and professional term occurrence problems can be alleviated by enabling interaction between topological and semantic information. Furthermore, to address the lack of labeled data in power systems, we built a Chinese event detection dataset based on electrical Power Event texts, named PoE. In experiments, our model achieves compelling results not only on the PoE dataset, but on general-domain event detection datasets including ACE 2005 and MAVEN. ",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict the missing links among knowledge graph (KG) entities. Though various methods have been developed for KGC, most of them can only deal with the KG entities seen in the training set and cannot perform well in predicting links concerning novel entities in the test set. Similar problem exists in temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs), and no previous temporal knowledge graph completion (TKGC) method is developed for modeling newly-emerged entities. Compared to KGs, TKGs require temporal reasoning techniques for modeling, which naturally increases the difficulty in dealing with novel, yet unseen entities. In this work, we focus on the inductive learning of unseen entities' representations on TKGs. We propose a few-shot out-of-graph (OOG) link prediction task for TKGs, where we predict the missing entities from the links concerning unseen entities by employing a meta-learning framework and utilizing the meta-information provided by only few edges associated with each unseen entity. We construct three new datasets for TKG few-shot OOG link prediction, and we propose a model that mines the concept-aware information among entities. Experimental results show that our model achieves superior performance on all three datasets and our concept-aware modeling component demonstrates a strong effect. ",

This paper shows that this extreme amount of uncertainty cannot be tolerated under sampling, not even if sampling could become infinitely frequent as the deadline is approached, unless the sampling strategy were designed according to the growth of the control action. Robustness under model uncertainty is analyzed and the amount of uncertainty that can be tolerated under sampling is quantified in order to formulate the least restrictive prescribed-time control problem that is practically implementable. Some solutions to this problem are given for a scalar system. Moreover, either under a-priori knowledge of bounds for initial conditions, or if the strategy can be selected after the first measurement becomes available, it is shown that the real, practically achievable objectives can also be reached with linear control and uniform sampling. These derivations serve to yield insight into the real advantages that implementation of prescribed-time controllers may have. ",

However, little has been studied about this phenomenon and its effects on downstream tasks. In the present work, we systematically study the association between frequency and semantic similarity in several static word embeddings. We find that Skip-gram, GloVe and FastText embeddings tend to produce higher semantic similarity between high-frequency words than between other frequency combinations. We show that the association between frequency and similarity also appears when words are randomly shuffled. This proves that the patterns found are not due to real semantic associations present in the texts, but are an artifact produced by the word embeddings. Finally, we provide an example of how word frequency can strongly impact the measurement of gender bias with embedding-based metrics. In particular, we carry out a controlled experiment that shows that biases can even change sign or reverse their order by manipulating word frequencies. ",

The standard few-shot pipeline follows extraction of appearance queries from exemplars and matching them with image features to infer the object counts. Existing methods extract queries by feature pooling, but neglect the shape information (e.g., size and aspect), which leads to a reduced object localization accuracy and count estimates. We propose a Low-shot Object Counting network with iterative prototype Adaptation (LOCA). Our main contribution is the new object prototype extraction module, which iteratively fuses the exemplar shape and appearance queries with image features. The module is easily adapted to zero-shot scenario, enabling LOCA to cover the entire spectrum of low-shot counting problems. LOCA outperforms all recent state-of-the-art methods on FSC147 benchmark by 20-30% in RMSE on one-shot and few-shot and achieves state-of-the-art on zero-shot scenarios, while demonstrating better generalization capabilities.

We implement a two-way handshake before each data slot to avoid deadlocks, a phenomena that plagues 802.11. Through theoretical analysis, we derive the system throughput achieved by our MAC protocol.

    "abstract": "Choosing a good resource configuration for big data analytics applications can be challenging, especially in cloud environments. Automated approaches are desirable as poor decisions can reduce performance and raise costs. The majority of existing automated approaches either build performance models from previous workload executions or conduct iterative resource configuration profiling until a near-optimal solution has been found. In doing so, they only obtain an implicit understanding of the underlying infrastructure, which is difficult to transfer to alternative infrastructures and, thus, profiling and modeling insights are not sustained beyond very specific situations. We present Perona, a novel approach to robust infrastructure fingerprinting for usage in the context of big data analytics. Perona employs common sets and configurations of benchmarking tools for target resources, so that resulting benchmark metrics are directly comparable and ranking is enabled. Insignificant benchmark metrics are discarded by learning a low-dimensional representation of the input metric vector, and previous benchmark executions are taken into consideration for context-awareness as well, allowing to detect resource degradation. We evaluate our approach both on data gathered from our own experiments as well as within related works for resource configuration optimization, demonstrating that Perona captures the characteristics from benchmark runs in a compact manner and produces representations that can be used directly.

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) pre-trains general-purpose encoders using an unlabeled pre-training dataset, which consists of images (called single-modal CL) or image-text pairs (called multi-modal CL). CL is vulnerable to data poisoning based backdoor attacks (DPBAs), in which an attacker injects poisoned inputs into the pre-training dataset so the encoder is backdoored. However, existing DPBAs achieve limited effectiveness. In this work, we propose new DPBAs called CorruptEncoder to CL. Our experiments show that CorruptEncoder substantially outperforms existing DPBAs for both single-modal and multi-modal CL. CorruptEncoder is the first DPBA that achieves more than 90% attack success rates on single-modal CL with only a few (3) reference images and a small poisoning ratio (0.5%). Moreover, we also propose a defense, called localized cropping, to defend single-modal CL against DPBAs. Our results show that our defense can reduce the effectiveness of DPBAs, but it sacrifices the utility of the encoder, highlighting the needs of new defenses. ",

This paper firstly proposes a language-specific model that extract emotional information from multiple pre-trained speech models, and then designs a multi-domain model that simultaneously performs SER for various languages. Our multidomain model employs a multi-gating mechanism to generate unique weighted feature combination for each language, and also searches for specific neural network structure for each language through a neural architecture search module. In addition, we introduce a contrastive auxiliary loss to build more separable representations for audio data.

A core problem of LJP is how to distinguish confusing legal cases, where only subtle text differences exist. Previous studies fail to distinguish different classification errors with a standard cross-entropy classification loss, and ignore the numbers in the fact description for predicting the term of penalty. To tackle these issues, in this work, first, we propose a moco-based supervised contrastive learning to learn distinguishable representations, and explore the best strategy to construct positive example pairs to benefit all three subtasks of LJP simultaneously. Second, in order to exploit the numbers in legal cases for predicting the penalty terms of certain cases, we further enhance the representation of the fact description with extracted crime amounts which are encoded by a pre-trained numeracy model. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results, especially on confusing legal cases.

Our goal is to build neural networks that combine the advantages of both approaches. Motivated by the perspective to inject causal knowledge while training such neural networks, this work presents initial steps in that direction. We demonstrate how a neural network can be trained to output conditional probabilities, providing approximately the same functionality as a Bayesian Network. Additionally, we propose two training strategies that allow encoding the independence relations inferred from a given causal structure into the neural network. We present initial results in a proof-of-concept setting, showing that the neural model acts as an understudy to its Bayesian Network counterpart, approximating its probabilistic and causal properties.

    "abstract": "Recent progress on 2D object detection has featured Cascade RCNN, which capitalizes on a sequence of cascade detectors to progressively improve proposal quality, towards high-quality object detection. However, there has not been evidence in support of building such cascade structures for 3D object detection, a challenging detection scenario with highly sparse LiDAR point clouds. In this work, we present a simple yet effective cascade architecture, named 3D Cascade RCNN, that allocates multiple detectors based on the voxelized point clouds in a cascade paradigm, pursuing higher quality 3D object detector progressively. Furthermore, we quantitatively define the sparsity level of the points within 3D bounding box of each object as the point completeness score, which is exploited as the task weight for each proposal to guide the learning of each stage detector. The spirit behind is to assign higher weights for high-quality proposals with relatively complete point distribution, while down-weight the proposals with extremely sparse points that often incur noise during training. This design of completeness-aware re-weighting elegantly upgrades the cascade paradigm to be better applicable for the sparse input data, without increasing any FLOP budgets. Through extensive experiments on both the KITTI dataset and Waymo Open Dataset, we validate the superiority of our proposed 3D Cascade RCNN, when comparing to state-of-the-art 3D object detection techniques.

Such encoded rotation condition then determines which part of the network parameters to be focused on, and is shown to efficiently help reduce the degree of freedom of the optimization during training. This mechanism henceforth can better leverage the rotation augmentations through reduced training difficulties, making SPE-Net robust against rotated data both during training and testing. The new findings in our paper also urge us to rethink the relationship between the extracted rotation information and the actual test accuracy. Intriguingly, we reveal evidences that by locally encoding the rotation information through SPE-Net, the rotation-invariant features are still of critical importance in benefiting the test samples without any actual global rotation. We empirically demonstrate the merits of the SPE-Net and the associated hypothesis on four benchmarks, showing evident improvements on both rotated and unrotated test data over SOTA methods.

The implicit problem for obtaining the displacement at each time step is solved by transforming the equilibrium equations into Fourier space and solving the corresponding linear system with a preconditioned Krylov solver. The resulting method is validated against analytical solutions and compared with implicit and explicit finite element simulations and with an explicit FFT approach. The accuracy of the method is similar to or better than that of finite elements, and the numerical performance is clearly superior, allowing the use of much larger models.

In order to overcome this drawback, we propose Sparsity and Delay Embedding based Forecasting (SPADE4) for predicting epidemics. SPADE4 predicts the future trajectory of an observable variable without the knowledge of the other variables or the underlying system. We use random features model with sparse regression to handle the data scarcity issue and employ Takens' delay embedding theorem to capture the nature of the underlying system from the observed variable. We show that our approach outperforms compartmental models when applied to both simulated and real data. ",

    "abstract": "Disentangling facial movements from other facial characteristics, particularly from facial identity, remains a challenging task, as facial movements display great variation between individuals. In this paper, we aim to characterize individual-specific facial movements. We present a novel training approach to learn facial movements independently of other facial characteristics, focusing on each individual separately. We propose self-supervised Person-Specific Models (PSMs), in which one model per individual can learn to extract an embedding of the facial movements independently of the person's identity and other structural facial characteristics from unlabeled facial video. These models are trained using encoder-decoder-like architectures. We provide quantitative and qualitative evidence that a PSM learns a meaningful facial embedding that discovers fine-grained movements otherwise not characterized by a General Model (GM), which is trained across individuals and characterizes general patterns of facial movements. We present quantitative and qualitative evidence that this approach is easily scalable and generalizable for new individuals: facial movements knowledge learned on a person can quickly and effectively be transferred to a new person. Lastly, we propose a novel PSM using curriculum temporal learning to leverage the temporal contiguity between video frames.

We study the computational complexity of Red-Blue Separation, in which one asks whether a given red-blue colored graph has a red-blue separating set of size at most a given integer. We prove that the problem is NP-complete even for restricted graph classes. We also show that it is always approximable in polynomial time within a factor of $2\\ln n$, where $n$ is the input graph's order. In contrast, for triangle-free graphs and for graphs of bounded maximum degree, we show that Red-Blue Separation is solvable in polynomial time when the size of the smaller color class is bounded by a constant. However, on general graphs, we show that the problem is $W[2]$-hard even when parameterized by the solution size plus the size of the smaller color class. We also consider the problem Max Red-Blue Separation where the coloring is not part of the input. Here, given an input graph $G$, we want to determine the smallest integer $k$ such that, for every possible red-blue coloring of $G$, there is a red-blue separating set of size at most $k$. We derive tight bounds on the cardinality of an optimal solution of Max Red-Blue Separation, showing that it can range from logarithmic in the graph order, up to the order minus one. We also give bounds with respect to related parameters. For trees however we prove an upper bound of two-thirds the order. We then show that Max Red-Blue Separation is NP-hard, even for graphs of bounded maximum degree, but can be approximated in polynomial time within a factor of $O(\\ln^2 n)$. ",

To break through the information bottleneck of 2D clues, we explore a new perspective: Temporal 2D Supervision. We propose a temporal 2D transformation to bridge the 3D predictions with temporal 2D labels. Two steps, including homography wraping and 2D box deduction, are taken to transform the 3D predictions into 2D ones for supervision. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset show strong results (nearly 90% of its fully-supervised performance) with only 25% 3D annotations.

    "abstract": "We present the Cross-stitched Multi-task Unified Dual Recursive Network (CMUDRN) model targeting the task of unified deraining and desnowing in a multi-task learning setting. This unified model borrows from the basic Dual Recursive Network (DRN) architecture developed by Cai et al. The proposed model makes use of cross-stitch units that enable multi-task learning across two separate DRN models, each tasked for single image deraining and desnowing, respectively. By fixing cross-stitch units at several layers of basic task-specific DRN networks, we perform multi-task learning over the two separate DRN models. To enable blind image restoration, on top of these structures we employ a simple neural fusion scheme which merges the output of each DRN. The separate task-specific DRN models and the fusion scheme are simultaneously trained by enforcing local and global supervision. Local supervision is applied on the two DRN submodules, and global supervision is applied on the data fusion submodule of the proposed model. Consequently, we both enable feature sharing across task-specific DRN models and control the image restoration behavior of the DRN submodules. An ablation study shows the strength of the hypothesized CMUDRN model, and experiments indicate that its performance is comparable or better than baseline DRN models on the single image deraining and desnowing tasks. Moreover, CMUDRN enables blind image restoration for the two underlying image restoration tasks, by unifying task-specific image restoration pipelines via a naive parametric fusion scheme. The CMUDRN implementation is available at https://github.com/VCL3D/CMUDRN. ",

In e-commerce, understanding users' needs or intentions requires substantial commonsense knowledge, e.g., ``A user bought an iPhone and a compatible case because the user wanted the phone to be protected''. In this paper, we present FolkScope, an intention knowledge graph construction framework, to reveal the structure of humans' minds about purchasing items on e-commerce platforms such as Amazon. As commonsense knowledge is usually ineffable and not expressed explicitly, it is challenging to perform any kind of information extraction. Thus, we propose a new approach that leverages the generation power of large-scale language models and human-in-the-loop annotations to semi-automatically construct the knowledge graph. We annotate a large amount of assertions for both plausibility and typicality of an intention that can explain a purchasing or co-purchasing behavior, where the intention can be an open reason or a predicate falling into one of 18 categories aligning with ConceptNet, e.g., IsA, MadeOf, UsedFor, etc. Then we populate the annotated information to all automatically generated ones, and further structurize the assertions using pattern mining and conceptualization to form more condensed and abstractive knowledge. We evaluate our knowledge graph using both intrinsic quality measures and a downstream application, i.e., recommendation. The comprehensive study shows that our knowledge graph can well model e-commerce commonsense knowledge and can have many potential applications. ",

The paper extends the famous alternate optimization algorithm weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) [1] under a causal inference framework to tackle with WSRM under latent interference. Namely, with the possibility of power policy shifting in the hidden network, computing an iterating direction based on the observed interference inherently implies that counterfactual is ignored in decision making. A synthetic control (SC) method is used to estimate the counterfactual. For any link in the known network, SC constructs a convex combination of the interference on other links and uses it as an estimate. Power iteration is performed on the estimated rather than the observed interference. The proposed SC-WMMSE requires no more information than its origin. To our best knowledge, this is the first paper explores the potential of causal inference to assist mathematical optimization in addressing classic wireless optimization problems. Numerical results suggest the superiority of the SC-WMMSE over the original in both convergence and objective. ",

It is known that the CSPs that admit efficient robust satisfaction algorithms are precisely those of bounded width, i.e., CSPs whose satisfiability can be checked by a simple local consistency algorithm (eg., 2-SAT or Horn-SAT in the Boolean case). While the exact satisfiability of a bounded width CSP can be checked by combinatorial algorithms, the robust algorithm is based on rounding a canonical Semidefinite programming(SDP) relaxation. In this work, we initiate the study of robust satisfaction algorithms for promise CSPs, which are a vast generalization of CSPs that have received much attention recently. The motivation is to extend the theory beyond CSPs, as well as to better understand the power of SDPs. We present robust SDP rounding algorithms under some general conditions, namely the existence of majority or alternating threshold polymorphisms. On the hardness front, we prove that the lack of such polymorphisms makes the PCSP hard for all pairs of symmetric Boolean predicates. Our method involves a novel method to argue SDP gaps via the absence of certain colorings of the sphere, with connections to sphere Ramsey theory. We conjecture that PCSPs with robust satisfaction algorithms are precisely those for which the feasibility of the canonical SDP implies (exact) satisfiability. We also give a precise algebraic condition, known as a minion characterization, of which PCSPs have the latter property. ",

Most existing approaches usually study networks with a single type of connection between vertices, while in many applications interactions between objects vary, yielding multiplex networks. We propose ANOMULY, a general, unsupervised edge anomaly detection framework for multiplex dynamic networks. In each relation type, ANOMULY sees node embeddings at different GNN layers as hierarchical node states and employs a GRU cell to capture temporal properties of the network and update node embeddings over time. We then add an attention mechanism that incorporates information across different types of relations. Our case study on brain networks shows how this approach could be employed as a new tool to understand abnormal brain activity that might reveal a brain disease or disorder.

    "abstract": "Air pollution is a major global environmental health threat, in particular for people who live or work near pollution sources. Areas adjacent to pollution sources often have high ambient pollution concentrations, and those areas are commonly referred to as air pollution hotspots. Detecting and characterizing pollution hotspots are of great importance for air quality management, but are challenging due to the high spatial and temporal variability of air pollutants. In this work, we explore the use of mobile sensing data (i.e., air quality sensors installed on vehicles) to detect pollution hotspots. One major challenge with mobile sensing data is uneven sampling, i.e., data collection can vary by both space and time. To address this challenge, we propose a two-step approach to detect hotspots from mobile sensing data, which includes local spike detection and sample-weighted clustering. Essentially, this approach tackles the uneven sampling issue by weighting samples based on their spatial frequency and temporal hit rate, so as to identify robust and persistent hotspots. To contextualize the hotspots and discover potential pollution source characteristics, we explore a variety of cross-domain urban data and extract features from them. As a soft-validation of the extracted features, we build hotspot inference models for cities with and without mobile sensing data. Evaluation results using real-world mobile sensing air quality data as well as cross-domain urban data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting and inferring pollution hotspots. Furthermore, the empirical analysis of hotspots and source features yields useful insights regarding neighborhood pollution sources. ",

    "abstract": "We propose the intermittently tethered unmanned aerial vehicle (iTUAV) as a tradeoff between the power availability of a tethered UAV (TUAV) and the flexibility of an untethered UAV. An iTUAV can provide cellular connectivity while being temporarily tethered to the most adequate ground anchor. Also, it can flexibly detach from one anchor, travel, then attach to another one to maintain/improve the coverage quality for mobile users. Hence, we discuss here the existing UAV-based cellular networking technologies, followed by a detailed description of the iTUAV system, its components, and mode of operation. Subsequently, we present a comparative study of the existing and proposed systems highlighting the differences in key features such as mobility and energy. To emphasize the potential of iTUAV systems, we conduct a case study, evaluate the iTUAV performance, and compare it to benchmarks. Obtained results show that with only 10 anchors in the area, the iTUAV system can serve up to 90% of the users covered by the untethered UAV swapping system. Moreover, results from a small case study prove that the iTUAV allows to balance performance/cost and can be implemented realistically. For instance, when user locations are clustered, with only 2 active iTUAVs and 4 anchors, achieved performance is superior to that of the system with 3 TUAVs, while when considering a single UAV on a 100 minutes event, a system with only 6 anchors outperforms the untethered UAV as it combines location flexibility with increased mission time.

Coordination graphs (CGs) represent a higher-order decomposition by incorporating pairwise payoff functions and thus is supposed to have a more powerful representational capacity. However, CGs decompose the global value function linearly over local value functions, severely limiting the complexity of the value function class that can be represented. In this paper, we propose the first non-linear coordination graph by extending CG value decomposition beyond the linear case. One major challenge is to conduct greedy action selections in this new function class to which commonly adopted DCOP algorithms are no longer applicable. We study how to solve this problem when mixing networks with LeakyReLU activation are used. An enumeration method with a global optimality guarantee is proposed and motivates an efficient iterative optimization method with a local optimality guarantee. We find that our method can achieve superior performance on challenging multi-agent coordination tasks like MACO. ",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are well suited for resource-constrained applications as they do not need expensive multipliers. In a typical rate-encoded SNN, a series of binary spikes within a globally fixed time window is used to fire the neurons. The maximum number of spikes in this time window is also the latency of the network in performing a single inference, as well as determines the overall energy efficiency of the model. The aim of this paper is to reduce this while maintaining accuracy when converting ANNs to their equivalent SNNs. The state-of-the-art conversion schemes yield SNNs with accuracies comparable with ANNs only for large window sizes. In this paper, we start with understanding the information loss when converting from pre-existing ANN models to standard rate-encoded SNN models. From these insights, we propose a suite of novel techniques that together mitigate the information lost in the conversion, and achieve state-of-art SNN accuracies along with very low latency. Our method achieved a Top-1 SNN accuracy of 98.73% (1 time step) on the MNIST dataset, 76.38% (8 time steps) on the CIFAR-100 dataset, and 93.71% (8 time steps) on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning based solution called RL4OASD, which avoids all aforementioned issues of existing approaches. RL4OASD involves two networks, one responsible for learning features of road networks and trajectories and the other responsible for detecting anomalous subtrajectories based on the learned features, and the two networks can be trained iteratively without labeled data. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets, and the results show that our solution can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods (with 20-30% improvement) and is efficient for online detection (it takes less than 0.1ms to process each newly generated data point).

Compressing images using extremely low bitrates (<0.1 bpp) has been studied but it often results in low quality images of heavy artifacts due to the strong constraint in the number of bits available for the compressed data. It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words but on the other hand, language is very powerful in capturing the essence of an image using short descriptions. With the recent success of diffusion models for text-to-image generation, we propose a generative image compression method that demonstrates the potential of saving an image as a short text embedding which in turn can be used to generate high-fidelity images which is equivalent to the original one perceptually. For a given image, its corresponding text embedding is learned using the same optimization process as the text-to-image diffusion model itself, using a learnable text embedding as input after bypassing the original transformer. The optimization is applied together with a learning compression model to achieve extreme compression of low bitrates <0.1 bpp. Based on our experiments measured by a comprehensive set of image quality metrics, our method outperforms the other state-of-the-art deep learning methods in terms of both perceptual quality and diversity.

The method is of particular interest in strong gravitational time delay cosmography (TDC), where characterizing the \"external convergence\" ($\\kappa_{\\rm ext}$) from the lens environment and line of sight is necessary for precise inference of the Hubble constant ($H_0$). Starting from a large-scale simulation with a $\\kappa$ resolution of $\\sim$1$'$, we introduce fluctuations on galaxy-galaxy lensing scales of $\\sim$1$''$ and extract random sightlines to train our BGNN. We then evaluate the model on test sets with varying degrees of overlap with the training distribution. For each test set of 1,000 sightlines, the BGNN infers the individual $\\kappa$ posteriors, which we combine in a hierarchical Bayesian model to yield constraints on the hyperparameters governing the population. For a test field well sampled by the training set, the BGNN recovers the population mean of $\\kappa$ precisely and without bias, resulting in a contribution to the $H_0$ error budget well under 1\\%. In the tails of the training set with sparse samples, the BGNN, which can ingest all available information about each sightline, extracts more $\\kappa$ signal compared to a simplified version of the traditional method based on matching galaxy number counts, which is limited by sample variance. Our hierarchical inference pipeline using BGNNs promises to improve the $\\kappa_{\\rm ext}$ characterization for precision TDC.

Given discrete signals sharing the same histogram of attributes and different arrangement orders, the hash-table could project the coordinates into the same distribution for which the mapped signal can be better modeled using the subsequent INR network, leading to significantly alleviated spectral bias. Experiments not only reveal the generalization of the DINER for different INR backbones (MLP vs. SIREN) and various tasks (image/video representation, phase retrieval, and refractive index recovery) but also show the superiority over the state-of-the-art algorithms both in quality and speed.

An efficient statistical method is proposed to make blind predictions for the mean squared error of the DL-estimated channel solely based on received pilots, without knowledge of the ground-truth channel, the prior distribution of the channel, or the noise statistics. The complexity of the blind performance prediction is low and scales only linearly with the number of antennas. Simulation results for ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (UM-MIMO) channel estimation with a mixture of far-field and near-field paths are provided to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.

Despite the achieved inspiring performance by existing automatic segmentation methods, multi-modal MRI data are still unavailable in real-world clinical applications due to quite a few uncontrollable factors (e.g. different imaging protocols, data corruption, and patient condition limitations), which lead to a large performance drop during practical applications. In this work, we propose a Deeply supervIsed knowledGE tranSfer neTwork (DIGEST), which achieves accurate brain tumor segmentation under different modality-missing scenarios. Specifically, a knowledge transfer learning frame is constructed, enabling a student model to learn modality-shared semantic information from a teacher model pretrained with the complete multi-modal MRI data. To simulate all the possible modality-missing conditions under the given multi-modal data, we generate incomplete multi-modal MRI samples based on Bernoulli sampling. Finally, a deeply supervised knowledge transfer loss is designed to ensure the consistency of the teacher-student structure at different decoding stages, which helps the extraction of inherent and effective modality representations. Experiments on the BraTS 2020 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves promising results for the incomplete multi-modal MR image segmentation task. ",

These disruptions cause huge economic losses, affect the reputation of airlines, lead to a wastage of time and money of passengers, and have a direct environmental impact. This paper presents a novel network science approach for modelling and analysis of an airline's flight schedules and its historical operational data. The final aim is to find out the most disruptive airports, flights, flight-connections and connection-type in an airline network. In this regard, disruptive elements refer to influential or critical entities of an airline network. These are the elements which either can cause (as per airline schedules) or has caused (as per the historical data) the biggest disturbances in the network. An airline, then can improve their operations by avoiding disruptive elements. This can be achieved through introduction of an extra slack time between connecting flights and by creation of alternate arrangements for aircraft and crew members for the disruptive flights and flight-connections. The proposed network science approach for disruptive elements' analysis is validated with a case-study of an operating airline. Interestingly, the analysis shows that (potential) disruptive elements in the schedule of the airline are also (actual) disruptive elements in the historical data and should be attended first to improve operations.

Innovations and revolutions of Computer Vision with Deep learning methods offer great promise for fast and accurate diagnosis of screening and detection from chest X-Ray images (CXR). This work presents rapid detection of diseases in the lung using the efficient Deep learning pre-trained RepVGG algorithm for deep feature extraction and classification. We performed automatic classification of X-Ray images into three categories as Covid-19, Pneumonia, and Normal X-Ray cases. For evaluation, first, we used a histogram-oriented gradient (HOG) to detect the shape of the region of interest (ROI). We used the ROI object to improve the detection accuracy for lung extraction, followed by data pre-processing and augmentation. Then a pre-trained RepVGG model is used for deep feature extraction and classification, similar to VGG and ResNet convolutional neural network for the training-time and inference-time architecture transformed from the multi to the flat mode by a structural re-parameterization technique. Next, using the Computer Vision technique, we created a feature map and superimposed it on the original images. We used this technique for the automatic highlighted detection of affected areas of people's lungs. Based on the X-Ray images, we developed an algorithm that classifies X-Ray images with height accuracy and power faster thanks to the architecture transformation of the model. We compare deep learning frameworks' accuracy and detection of disease. The study shows the high power of deep learning methods for X-Ray images based on COVID-19 detection utilizing chest X-Ray. The proposed framework shows better diagnostic accuracy by comparing popular deep learning models, i.e., VGG, ResNet50, inceptionV3, DenseNet, and InceptionResnetV2. ",

As high-throughput sequencing technologies continue to advance, such assembly, alignment and curation may become a bottleneck, creating a need for methods which can process raw sequencing reads directly. In this paper, we propose Reads2Vec, an alignment-free embedding approach that can generate a fixed-length feature vector representation directly from the raw sequencing reads without requiring assembly. Furthermore, since such an embedding is a numerical representation, it may be applied to highly optimized classification and clustering algorithms. Experiments on simulated data show that our proposed embedding obtains better classification results and better clustering properties contrary to existing alignment-free baselines. In a study on real data, we show that alignment-free embeddings have better clustering properties than the Pangolin tool and that the spike region of the SARS-CoV-2 genome heavily informs the alignment-free clusterings, which is consistent with current biological knowledge of SARS-CoV-2.

    "title": "Attacking and Defending Deep-Learning-Based Off-Device Wireless  Positioning Systems",
    "abstract": "Localization services for wireless devices play an increasingly important role and a plethora of emerging services and applications already rely on precise position information. Widely used on-device positioning methods, such as the global positioning system, enable accurate outdoor positioning and provide the users with full control over what services are allowed to access location information. To provide accurate positioning indoors or in cluttered urban scenarios without line-of-sight satellite connectivity, powerful off-device positioning systems, which process channel state information (CSI) with deep neural networks, have emerged recently. Such off-device positioning systems inherently link a user's data transmission with its localization, since accurate CSI measurements are necessary for reliable wireless communication -- this not only prevents the users from controlling who can access this information but also enables virtually everyone in the device's range to estimate its location, resulting in serious privacy and security concerns. We propose on-device attacks against off-device wireless positioning systems in multi-antenna orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems while minimizing the impact on quality-of-service, and we demonstrate their efficacy using measured datasets for outdoor and indoor scenarios. We also investigate defenses to counter such attack mechanisms, and we discuss the limitations and implications on protecting location privacy in future wireless communication systems. ",

    "abstract": "Building accurate Deep Learning (DL) models for brain age prediction is a very relevant topic in neuroimaging, as it could help better understand neurodegenerative disorders and find new biomarkers. To estimate accurate and generalizable models, large datasets have been collected, which are often multi-site and multi-scanner. This large heterogeneity negatively affects the generalization performance of DL models since they are prone to overfit site-related noise. Recently, contrastive learning approaches have been shown to be more robust against noise in data or labels. For this reason, we propose a novel contrastive learning regression loss for robust brain age prediction using MRI scans. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenBHB challenge, yielding the best generalization capability and robustness to site-related noise. ",

MargNet consists of a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architectures. Using a carefully curated dataset consisting of 240,000 compact objects and an additional 150,000 faint objects, the machine learns classification directly from the data, minimising the need for human intervention. MargNet is the first classifier focusing exclusively on compact galaxies and performs better than other methods to classify compact galaxies from stars and quasars, even at fainter magnitudes. This model and feature engineering in such deep learning architectures will provide greater success in identifying objects in the ongoing and upcoming surveys, such as Dark Energy Survey (DES) and images from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. ",

    "abstract": "This research introduces for the first time the concept of multimodal learning in bankruptcy prediction models. We use the Conditional Multimodal Discriminative (CMMD) model to learn multimodal representations that embed information from accounting, market, and textual modalities. The CMMD model needs a sample with all data modalities for model training. At test time, the CMMD model only needs access to accounting and market modalities to generate multimodal representations, which are further used to make bankruptcy predictions. This fact makes the use of bankruptcy prediction models using textual data realistic and possible, since accounting and market data are available for all companies unlike textual data. The empirical results in this research show that the classification performance of our proposed methodology is superior compared to that of a large number of traditional classifier models. We also show that our proposed methodology solves the limitation of previous bankruptcy models using textual data, as they can only make predictions for a small proportion of companies. Finally, based on multimodal representations, we introduce an index that is able to capture the uncertainty of the financial situation of companies during periods of financial distress. ",

Its acyclic chromatic number $\\chi_a(G)$ is the minimum $k$ such that there exists a proper $k$-colouring of $G$ with no bicoloured cycle. In general, when $G$ has maximum degree $\\Delta$, it is known that $\\chi_a(G) = O(\\Delta^{4/3})$ as $\\Delta \\to \\infty$. We study the effect on this bound of further requiring that $G$ does not contain some fixed subgraph $F$ on $t$ vertices. We establish that the bound is constant if $F$ is a subdivided tree, $O(t^{8/3}\\Delta^{2/3})$ if $F$ is a forest, $O(\\sqrt{t}\\Delta)$ if $F$ is bipartite and 1-acyclic, $2\\Delta + o(\\Delta)$ if $F$ is an even cycle of length at least $6$, and $O(t^{1/4}\\Delta^{5/4})$ if $F=K_{3,t}$.
