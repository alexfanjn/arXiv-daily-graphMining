    "title": "Learnable Graph Convolutional Network and Feature Fusion for Multi-view  Learning",
    "abstract": "In practical applications, multi-view data depicting objectives from assorted perspectives can facilitate the accuracy increase of learning algorithms. However, given multi-view data, there is limited work for learning discriminative node relationships and graph information simultaneously via graph convolutional network that has drawn the attention from considerable researchers in recent years. Most of existing methods only consider the weighted sum of adjacency matrices, yet a joint neural network of both feature and graph fusion is still under-explored. To cope with these issues, this paper proposes a joint deep learning framework called Learnable Graph Convolutional Network and Feature Fusion (LGCN-FF), consisting of two stages: feature fusion network and learnable graph convolutional network. The former aims to learn an underlying feature representation from heterogeneous views, while the latter explores a more discriminative graph fusion via learnable weights and a parametric activation function dubbed Differentiable Shrinkage Activation (DSA) function. The proposed LGCN-FF is validated to be superior to various state-of-the-art methods in multi-view semi-supervised classification. ",

    "abstract": "Reliability and determinism of Wi-Fi can be tangibly improved by means of seamless redundancy, to the point of making this technology suitable for industrial environments. As pointed out in recent papers, the most benefits can be achieved when no phenomena can simultaneously affect transmissions on all channels of a redundant link. In this paper, several aspects are analyzed which, if not properly counteracted, may worsen seamless redundancy effectiveness. Effects they cause on communication have been experimentally evaluated in real testbeds, which rely on commercial Wi-Fi devices. Then, practical guidelines are provided, which aim at preventing joint interference through a careful system design. Results show that measured communication quality can be made as good as expected in theory. ",

    "abstract": "Tasks critical to enterprise profitability, such as customer churn prediction, fraudulent account detection or customer lifetime value estimation, are often tackled by models trained on features engineered from customer data in tabular format. Application-specific feature engineering adds development, operationalization and maintenance costs over time. Recent advances in representation learning present an opportunity to simplify and generalize feature engineering across applications. When applying these advancements to tabular data researchers deal with data heterogeneity, variations in customer engagement history or the sheer volume of enterprise datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to encode tabular data containing customer transactions, purchase history and other interactions into a generic representation of a customer's association with the business. We then evaluate these embeddings as features to train multiple models spanning a variety of applications. CASPR, Customer Activity Sequence-based Prediction and Representation, applies Transformer architecture to encode activity sequences to improve model performance and avoid bespoke feature engineering across applications. Our experiments at scale validate CASPR for both small \\& large enterprise applications. ",

Yet, the mapping and the extent of the nature of the practices in which news outlets integrate social media use are still lacking. This study focuses on the pressures of immediacy on the media ecosystems, i.e., as organizational practices of news outlets that make choices related to social media content integration. By analyzing a large corpora of news outlets that have embedded tweets, this study analyzes tweet embedding practices by specifically focusing on the concept of chronemics, conceptualized here as the time needed to embed tweets. Temporal constraints are particularly pressing for journalistic practices, given the continuous pressures of the 24/7 news cycle. We ask two main questions: which types of outlets are quicker to embed tweets, and which types of users' tweets are more likely to be embedded quickly? ",

The coding scheme is transferred from the finite alphabet coordination problem for which it is proved to be optimal. The extension to the Gaussian setup is based on a non-standard weak typicality approach and requires a careful average estimation error analysis since the interim state is estimated by the decoder. We provide a single-letter expression that characterizes the optimal trade-off between the Witsenhausen power cost and estimation cost. The two auxiliary random variables improve the communication with the decoder, while performing the dual role of the channel input, which also controls the state of the system. Interestingly, we show that a pair of discrete and continuous auxiliary random variables, outperforms both Witsenhausen two point strategy and the best affine policies. The optimal choice of random variables remains unknown. ",

    "abstract": "Emotional Surveillance is an emerging area with wide-reaching privacy concerns. These concerns are exacerbated by ubiquitous IoT devices with multiple sensors that can support these surveillance use cases. The work presented here considers one such use case: the use of a speech emotion recognition (SER) classifier tied to a smart speaker. This work demonstrates the ability to evade black-box SER classifiers tied to a smart speaker without compromising the utility of the smart speaker. This privacy concern is considered through the lens of adversarial evasion of machine learning. Our solution, Defeating Acoustic Recognition of Emotion via Genetic Programming (DARE-GP), uses genetic programming to generate non-invasive additive audio perturbations (AAPs). By constraining the evolution of these AAPs, transcription accuracy can be protected while simultaneously degrading SER classifier performance. The additive nature of these AAPs, along with an approach that generates these AAPs for a fixed set of users in an utterance and user location-independent manner, supports real-time, real-world evasion of SER classifiers. DARE-GP's use of spectral features, which underlay the emotional content of speech, allows the transferability of AAPs to previously unseen black-box SER classifiers. Further, DARE-GP outperforms state-of-the-art SER evasion techniques and is robust against defenses employed by a knowledgeable adversary. The evaluations in this work culminate with acoustic evaluations against two off-the-shelf commercial smart speakers, where a single AAP could evade a black box classifier over 70% of the time. The final evaluation deployed AAP playback on a small-form-factor system (raspberry pi) integrated with a wake-word system to evaluate the efficacy of a real-world, real-time deployment where DARE-GP is automatically invoked with the smart speaker's wake word.

    "abstract": "Federated learning allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a model without exchanging their data, thus preserving data privacy. Unfortunately, it suffers significant performance degradation under heterogeneous data at clients. Common solutions in local training involve designing a specific auxiliary loss to regularize weight divergence or feature inconsistency. However, we discover that these approaches fall short of the expected performance because they ignore the existence of a vicious cycle between classifier divergence and feature mapping inconsistency across clients, such that client models are updated in inconsistent feature space with diverged classifiers. We then propose a simple yet effective framework named Federated learning with Feature Anchors (FedFA) to align the feature mappings and calibrate classifier across clients during local training, which allows client models updating in a shared feature space with consistent classifiers. We demonstrate that this modification brings similar classifiers and a virtuous cycle between feature consistency and classifier similarity across clients. Extensive experiments show that FedFA significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms on various image classification datasets under label and feature distribution skews.

    "abstract": "Only when understanding hackers' tactics, can we thwart their attacks. With this spirit, this paper studies how hackers can effectively launch the so-called 'targeted node attacks', in which iterative attacks are staged on a network, and in each iteration the most important node is removed. In the existing attacks for weighted networks, the node importance is typically measured by the centralities related to shortest-path lengths, and the attack effectiveness is also measured mostly by length-related metrics. However, this paper argues that flows can better reflect network functioning than shortest-path lengths for those networks with carrying traffic as the main functionality. Thus, this paper proposes metrics based on flows for measuring the node importance and the attack effectiveness, respectively. Our node importance metrics include three flow-based centralities (flow betweenness, current-flow betweenness and current-flow closeness), which have not been proposed for use in the attacks on weighted networks yet. Our attack effectiveness metric is a new one proposed by us based on average network flow. Extensive experiments on both artificial and real-world networks show that the attack methods with our three suggested centralities are more effective than the existing attack methods when evaluated under our proposed attack effectiveness metric.

This indicator gives information on the areas of interest of a website that will be visited by a user over a time window, without requiring to know the structure of the site in each window. Our approach leverages the population-level general gaze patterns and the user's visual kinetics. We show experimentally that it is possible to conduct such a prediction through multilabel classification models using a small number of users, obtaining an average area under curve of 84.3 %, an average accuracy of 79 %, and an individual area of interest accuracy of 77 %. Furthermore, the user's visual kinetics features are consistently selected in every set of a cross-validation evaluation. ",

    "abstract": "Object recognition and reconstruction is of great interest in many research fields. Detecting pedestrians or cars in traffic cameras or tracking seismic waves in geophysical exploration are only two of many applications. Recently, the authors developed a new method - Object reconstruction using K-approximation (ORKA) - to extract such objects out of given data. In this method a special object model is used where the movement and deformation of the object can be controlled to fit the application. ORKA in its current form is highly dependent on the data resolution. On the one hand, the movement of the object can only be reconstructed on a grid that depends on the data resolution. On the other hand, the runtime increases exponentially with the resolution. Hence, the resolution of the data needs to be in a small range where the reconstruction is accurate enough but the runtime is not too high. In this work, we present a multiresolution approach, where we combine ORKA with a wavelet decomposition of the data. The object is then reconstructed iteratively what drastically reduces the runtime. Moreover, we can increase the data resolution such that the movement reconstruction no longer depends on the original grid. We also give a brief introduction on the original ORKA algorithm. Hence, knowledge of the previous work is not required. ",

Existing methods relying on temporal inconsistencies for DF detection present many advantages over the typical frame-based methods. However, they still show limited cross-dataset generalization and robustness to common distortions. These shortcomings are partially due to error-prone motion estimation and landmark tracking, or the susceptibility of the pixel intensity-based features to spatial distortions and the cross-dataset domain shifts. Our key insight to overcome these issues is to leverage the temporal phase variations in the band-pass components of the Complex Steerable Pyramid on face sub-regions. This not only enables a robust estimate of the temporal dynamics in these regions, but is also less prone to cross-dataset variations. Furthermore, the band-pass filters used to compute the local per-frame phase form an effective defense against the perturbations commonly seen in gradient-based adversarial attacks. Overall, with PhaseForensics, we show improved distortion and adversarial robustness, and state-of-the-art cross-dataset generalization, with 91.2% video-level AUC on the challenging CelebDFv2 (a recent state-of-the-art compares at 86.9%).

The key objective of this work is to learn useful embeddings associated with high performance in downstream event detection tasks when labeled data is scarce and the audio events of interest (songbird vocalizations) are sparse. We base our approach on deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA) that suffers from event sparseness. We overcome the sparseness of positive labels by first learning a data sampling model from the labelled data and by applying DCCA on the output it produces. This method that we term balanced DCCA (b-DCCA) improves the performance of the unsupervised embeddings on the downstream supervised audio detection task compared to classsical DCCA. Because data labels are frequently imbalanced, our method might be of broad utility in low-resource scenarios. ",

Owing to its low cost and high efficiency, multi-view 3D object detection has demonstrated promising application prospects.

Current approaches tend to adopt heavy backbones for image encoders, making them inapplicable for real-world deployment. Different from the images, LiDAR points are superior in providing spatial cues, resulting in highly precise localization. In this paper, we explore the incorporation of LiDAR-based detectors for multi-view 3D object detection. Instead of directly training a depth prediction network, we unify the image and LiDAR features in the Bird-Eye-View (BEV) space and adaptively transfer knowledge across non-homogenous representations in a teacher-student paradigm. To this end, we propose \\textbf{BEVDistill}, a cross-modal BEV knowledge distillation (KD) framework for multi-view 3D object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current KD approaches on a highly-competitive baseline, BEVFormer, without introducing any extra cost in the inference phase. Notably, our best model achieves 59.4 NDS on the nuScenes test leaderboard, achieving new state-of-the-art in comparison with various image-based detectors.

In addition, most of the voice synthesis models still require a large number of audio data paired with annotated labels (e.g., text transcription and music score) for training. To this end, we propose a unified framework of synthesizing and manipulating voice signals from analysis features, dubbed NANSY++. The backbone network of NANSY++ is trained in a self-supervised manner that does not require any annotations paired with audio. After training the backbone network, we efficiently tackle four voice applications - i.e. voice conversion, text-to-speech, singing voice synthesis, and voice designing - by partially modeling the analysis features required for each task. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework offers competitive advantages such as controllability, data efficiency, and fast training convergence, while providing high quality synthesis.

Simply attending longer transcription history for a vanilla neural transducer model shows no much gain in our preliminary experiments, since the prediction network is not a pure language model. This motivates us to leverage the factorized neural transducer structure, containing a real language model, the vocabulary predictor. We propose the {LongFNT-Text} architecture, which fuses the sentence-level long-form features directly with the output of the vocabulary predictor and then embeds token-level long-form features inside the vocabulary predictor, with a pre-trained contextual encoder RoBERTa to further boost the performance. Moreover, we propose the {LongFNT} architecture by extending the long-form speech to the original speech input and achieve the best performance. The effectiveness of our LongFNT approach is validated on LibriSpeech and GigaSpeech corpora with 19% and 12% relative word error rate~(WER) reduction, respectively. ",

In this paper, we propose FedSiam-DA, a novel dual-aggregated contrastive federated learning approach, to personalize both local and global models, under various settings of data heterogeneity. Firstly, based on the idea of contrastive learning in the Siamese Network, FedSiam-DA regards the local and global model as different branches of the Siamese Network during the local training and controls the update direction of the model by constantly changing model similarity to personalize the local model. Secondly, FedSiam-DA introduces dynamic weights based on model similarity for each local model and exercises the dual-aggregated mechanism to further improve the generalization of the global model. Moreover, we provide extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, the results demonstrate that FedSiam-DA achieves outperforming several previous FL approaches on heterogeneous datasets. ",

A lesser known alternative approach to storing short-term memory in \"synaptic connections\" -- by parameterising and controlling the dynamics of a context-sensitive time-varying weight matrix through another NN -- yields another \"natural\" type of short-term memory in sequence processing NNs: the Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) of the early 1990s. FWPs have seen a recent revival as generic sequence processors, achieving competitive performance across various tasks. They are formally closely related to the now popular Transformers. Here we present them in the context of artificial NNs as an abstraction of biological NNs -- a perspective that has not been stressed enough in previous FWP work. We first review aspects of FWPs for pedagogical purposes, then discuss connections to related works motivated by insights from neuroscience. ",

In this paper, a more generalized hierarchical routing protocol is introduced for Wireless Sensor Network, which is based on tree data structures. The clustering in the proposed protocol has the format of a general tree, which is constructed in an adaptive manner based on the distance of the sensors.

Since autonomous vehicles are highly safety-critical, ensuring robustness is essential for real-world deployment.

In addition, they lack far-range annotations, making it harder to train neural networks that are the base of a highway assistant function of an autonomous vehicle. Therefore, we introduce a multimodal dataset for robust autonomous driving with long-range perception. The dataset consists of 176 scenes with synchronized and calibrated LiDAR, camera, and radar sensors covering a 360-degree field of view. The collected data was captured in highway, urban, and suburban areas during daytime, night, and rain and is annotated with 3D bounding boxes with consistent identifiers across frames.

State-of-the-art approaches simply extract isolated concepts or attributes to assist description generation. However, such approaches do not consider the hierarchical semantic structure in the textual domain, which leads to an unpredictable mapping between visual representations and concept words. To this end, we propose a novel Progressive Tree-Structured prototype Network (dubbed PTSN), which is the first attempt to narrow down the scope of prediction words with appropriate semantics by modeling the hierarchical textual semantics. Specifically, we design a novel embedding method called tree-structured prototype, producing a set of hierarchical representative embeddings which capture the hierarchical semantic structure in textual space. To utilize such tree-structured prototypes into visual cognition, we also propose a progressive aggregation module to exploit semantic relationships within the image and prototypes. By applying our PTSN to the end-to-end captioning framework, extensive experiments conducted on MSCOCO dataset show that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with 144.2% (single model) and 146.5% (ensemble of 4 models) CIDEr scores on `Karpathy' split and 141.4% (c5) and 143.9% (c40) CIDEr scores on the official online test server.

Typically in ISAC, bistatic radar detection is done at a passive radar. The radar-mode performance is significantly more vulnerable than the communication-mode due to the double path-loss in the signal component while interferers have direct links. To combat this, we propose: 1) monostatic radar detection at the BS via full-duplex (FD), 2) a novel dynamic transmission strategy (DTS). With FD monostatic detection we are able to improve radar-mode performance over bistatic detection in certain scenarios, while bistatic detection dominates in others. We also analyze the performance of joint bistatic and FD monostatic detection. Significant improvements in radar-performance can be attained with joint detection in certain scenarios, while using one strategy is beneficial in others. Our results highlight that with the DTS we are able to significantly improve quality of radar detection at the cost of quantity. Further, DTS causes some performance deterioration to the communication-mode; however, the gains attained for the radar-mode are much higher. We show that joint detection and DTS together can significantly improve radar performance from a traditional radar-network. ",

Existing video captioning methods focus on making an exploration of spatial-temporal representations and their relationships to produce inferences. However, such methods only exploit the superficial association contained in the video itself without considering the intrinsic visual commonsense knowledge that existed in a video dataset, which may hinder their capabilities of knowledge cognitive to reason accurate descriptions. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet effective method, called Visual Commonsense-aware Representation Network (VCRN), for video captioning. Specifically, we construct a Video Dictionary, a plug-and-play component, obtained by clustering all video features from the total dataset into multiple clustered centers without additional annotation. Each center implicitly represents a visual commonsense concept in the video domain, which is utilized in our proposed Visual Concept Selection (VCS) to obtain a video-related concept feature. Next, a Conceptual Integration Generation (CIG) is proposed to enhance the caption generation. Extensive experiments on three publicly video captioning benchmarks: MSVD, MSR-VTT, and VATEX, demonstrate that our method reaches state-of-the-art performance, indicating the effectiveness of our method. In addition, our approach is integrated into the existing method of video question answering and improves this performance, further showing the generalization of our method.

Inspired by the back-translation technique proposed in the field of machine translation, we build a Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) model to predict the pronunciation of polyphonic character, and a Phoneme-to-Grapheme (P2G) model to predict pronunciation into text. Meanwhile, a window-based matching strategy and a multi-model scoring strategy are proposed to judge the correctness of the pseudo-label. We design a data balance strategy to improve the accuracy of some typical polyphonic characters in the training set with imbalanced distribution or data scarcity.

TRL aims to convert complicated raw trajectories into low-dimensional representation vectors, which can be applied to various downstream tasks, such as trajectory classification, clustering, and similarity computation. Existing TRL works usually treat trajectories as ordinary sequence data, while some important spatial-temporal characteristics, such as temporal regularities and travel semantics, are not fully exploited. To fill this gap, we propose a novel Self-supervised trajectory representation learning framework with TemporAl Regularities and Travel semantics, namely START. The proposed method consists of two stages. The first stage is a Trajectory Pattern-Enhanced Graph Attention Network (TPE-GAT), which converts the road network features and travel semantics into representation vectors of road segments. The second stage is a Time-Aware Trajectory Encoder (TAT-Enc), which encodes representation vectors of road segments in the same trajectory as a trajectory representation vector, meanwhile incorporating temporal regularities with the trajectory representation. Moreover, we also design two self-supervised tasks, i.e., span-masked trajectory recovery and trajectory contrastive learning, to introduce spatial-temporal characteristics of trajectories into the training process of our START framework. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world datasets for three downstream tasks.

This not only allows us to detect states underlying the data dynamics in an unsupervised manner, but also to infer the distribution of time spent in each state according to the learned SDE.

    "abstract": "Two of the main problems to achieve ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) are related to instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI) acquisition and the coexistence with other service modes such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB). The former comes from the non-negligible time required for accurate I-CSI acquisition, while the latter, from the heterogeneous and conflicting requirements of different nodes sharing the same network resources. In this paper, we leverage the I-CSI of multiple eMBB links and the channel measurement's history of a URLLC user for multi-antenna beamforming design. Specifically, we propose a precoding design that minimizes the transmit power of a base station (BS) providing eMBB and URLLC services with signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and outage constraints, respectively, by modifying existing I-CSI-based precoding schemes to account for URLLC channel history information. Moreover, we illustrate and validate the proposed method by adopting zero-forcing (ZF) and the transmit power minimization (TPM) precoding with SINR constraints. We show that the ZF implementation outperforms TPM in adverse channel conditions as in Rayleigh fading, while the situation is rapidly reversed as the channel experiences some line-of-sight (LOS). Finally, we determine the confidence levels at which the target outage probabilities are reached. For instance, we show that outage probabilities below $10^{-3}$ are achievable with more than 99$\\%$ confidence for both precoding schemes under favorable LOS conditions with 16 transmit antennas and 500 samples of URLLC channel history.

    "abstract": "Transfer adversarial attacks raise critical security concerns in real-world, black-box scenarios. However, the actual progress of attack methods is difficult to assess due to two main limitations in existing evaluations. First, existing evaluations are unsystematic and sometimes unfair since new methods are often directly added to old ones without complete comparisons to similar methods. Second, existing evaluations mainly focus on transferability but overlook another key attack property: stealthiness. In this work, we design good practices to address these limitations. We first introduce a new attack categorization, which enables our systematic analyses of similar attacks in each specific category. Our analyses lead to new findings that complement or even challenge existing knowledge. Furthermore, we comprehensively evaluate 23 representative attacks against 9 defenses on ImageNet. We pay particular attention to stealthiness, by adopting diverse imperceptibility metrics and looking into new, finer-grained characteristics. Our evaluation reveals new important insights: 1) Transferability is highly contextual, and some white-box defenses may give a false sense of security since they are actually vulnerable to (black-box) transfer attacks; 2) All transfer attacks are less stealthy, and their stealthiness can vary dramatically under the same $L_{\\infty}$ bound.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have recently achieved considerable improvements in learning human behavioral patterns and individual preferences from massive spatial-temporal trajectories data. However, most of the existing research concentrates on fusing different semantics underlying sequential trajectories for mobility pattern learning which, in turn, yields a narrow perspective on comprehending human intrinsic motions. In addition, the inherent sparsity and under-explored heterogeneous collaborative items pertaining to human check-ins hinder the potential exploitation of human diverse periodic regularities as well as common interests. Motivated by recent advances in disentanglement learning, in this study we propose a novel disentangled solution called SSDL for tackling the next POI prediction problem. SSDL primarily seeks to disentangle the potential time-invariant and time-varying factors into different latent spaces from massive trajectories data, providing an interpretable view to understand the intricate semantics underlying human diverse mobility representations. To address the data sparsity issue, we present two realistic trajectory augmentation approaches to enhance the understanding of both the human intrinsic periodicity and constantly-changing intents. In addition, we devise a POI-centric graph structure to explore heterogeneous collaborative signals underlying historical check-ins. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed SSDL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches -- for example, it yields up to 8.57% improvements on ACC@1.

This has opened the door to user-specific advertisements and recommendations on these platforms, bringing along a significant focus on Influence Maximisation (IM) on social networks due to its wide applicability in target advertising, viral marketing, and personalized recommendations. The aim of IM is to identify certain nodes in the network which can help maximize the spread of certain information through a diffusion cascade. While several works have been proposed for IM, most were inefficient in exploiting community structures to their full extent. In this work, we propose a community structures-based approach, which employs a K-Shell algorithm in order to generate a score for the connections between seed nodes and communities for low-budget scenarios. Further, our approach employs entropy within communities to ensure the proper spread of information within the communities. We choose the Independent Cascade (IC) model to simulate information spread and evaluate it on four evaluation metrics. We validate our proposed approach on eight publicly available networks and find that it significantly outperforms the baseline approaches on these metrics, while still being relatively efficient. ",

Though NeRF is able to render complex 3D scenes with view-dependent effects, few efforts have been devoted to exploring its limits in a high-resolution setting. Specifically, existing NeRF-based methods face several limitations when reconstructing high-resolution real scenes, including a very large number of parameters, misaligned input data, and overly smooth details. In this work, we conduct the first pilot study on training NeRF with high-resolution data and propose the corresponding solutions: 1) marrying the multilayer perceptron (MLP) with convolutional layers which can encode more neighborhood information while reducing the total number of parameters; 2) a novel training strategy to address misalignment caused by moving objects or small camera calibration errors; and 3) a high-frequency aware loss. Our approach is nearly free without introducing obvious training/testing costs, while experiments on different datasets demonstrate that it can recover more high-frequency details compared with the current state-of-the-art NeRF models.

    "abstract": "Influence Maximization (IM) is the task of determining k optimal influential nodes in a social network to maximize the influence spread using a propagation model. IM is a prominent problem for viral marketing, and helps significantly in social media advertising. However, developing effective algorithms with minimal time complexity for real-world social networks still remains a challenge. While traditional heuristic approaches have been applied for IM, they often result in minimal performance gains over the computationally expensive Greedy-based and Reverse Influence Sampling-based approaches. In this paper, we propose the discretization of the nature-inspired Harris Hawks Optimisation meta-heuristic algorithm using community structures for optimal selection of seed nodes for influence spread. In addition to Harris Hawks intelligence, we employ a neighbour scout strategy algorithm to avoid blindness and enhance the searching ability of the hawks. Further, we use a candidate nodes-based random population initialization approach, and these candidate nodes aid in accelerating the convergence process for the entire populace. We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed DHHO approach on six social networks using the Independent Cascade model for information diffusion. We observe that DHHO is comparable or better than competing meta-heuristic approaches for Influence Maximization across five metrics, and performs noticeably better than competing heuristic approaches.

These datasets can easily include more scenarios that might be costly to research with real data or can complement and, in some cases, replace real data measurements, depending on the quality of the synthetic data. They can also solve the unbalanced data problem, avoid overfitting, and can be used in training while testing can be done with real data. In this paper, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first synthetic dataset for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) attacks in 5G and beyond networks based on the following key observable network parameters that indicate power levels: the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Signal to Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR). The main objective of this data is to enable deep network development for UAV communication security. Especially, for algorithm development or the analysis of time-series data applied to UAV attack recognition. Our proposed dataset provides insights into network functionality when static or moving UAV attackers target authenticated UAVs in an urban environment. The dataset also considers the presence and absence of authenticated terrestrial users in the network, which may decrease the deep networks ability to identify attacks. Furthermore, the data provides deeper comprehension of the metrics available in the 5G physical and MAC layers for machine learning and statistics research.

While recent initiatives aim to develop comprehensive theoretical frameworks for understanding metric-related pitfalls in image analysis problems, there is a lack of experimental evidence on the concrete effects of common and rare pitfalls on specific applications. We address this gap in the literature in the context of colon cancer screening. Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we present the winning solution of the Endoscopy computer vision challenge (EndoCV) on colon cancer detection, conducted in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2022. Secondly, we demonstrate the sensitivity of commonly used metrics to a range of hyperparameters as well as the consequences of poor metric choices. Based on comprehensive validation studies performed with patient data from six clinical centers, we found all commonly applied object detection metrics to be subject to high inter-center variability. Furthermore, our results clearly demonstrate that the adaptation of standard hyperparameters used in the computer vision community does not generally lead to the clinically most plausible results. Finally, we present localization criteria that correspond well to clinical relevance. Our work could be a first step towards reconsidering common validation strategies in automatic colon cancer screening applications. ",

However, it may occur that such a writer wants to write in other venues anonymously or under a pseudonym (e.g., activist, whistle-blower). However, if an attacker has already built an accurate authorship attribution (AA) model based off of the writings from such platforms, attributing an anonymous writing to the known authorship is possible. Therefore, in this work, we ask a question \"can one make the writings and texts, T, in the open spaces such as opinion sharing platforms unattributable so that AA models trained from T cannot attribute authorship well?\" Toward this question, we present a novel solution, UPTON, that exploits textual data poisoning method to disturb the training process of AA models. UPTON uses data poisoning to destroy the authorship feature only in training samples by perturbing them, and try to make released textual data unlearnable on deep neuron networks. It is different from previous obfuscation works, that use adversarial attack to modify the test samples and mislead an AA model, and also the backdoor works, which use trigger words both in test and training samples and only change the model output when trigger words occur. Using four authorship datasets (e.g., IMDb10, IMDb64, Enron and WJO), then, we present empirical validation where: (1)UPTON is able to downgrade the test accuracy to about 30% with carefully designed target-selection methods. (2)UPTON poisoning is able to preserve most of the original semantics. The BERTSCORE between the clean and UPTON poisoned texts are higher than 0.95. The number is very closed to 1.00, which means no sematic change. (3)UPTON is also robust towards spelling correction systems. ",

The heart sound signal is one of the primary indicator of heart condition and can be used to detect abnormality in the heart.

But currently the detection of heart abnormality from heart sound signal depends largely on the expertise and experience of the physician. As such an automatic detection system for heart abnormality detection from heart sound signal can be a great asset for the people living in underdeveloped areas.

The deep neural network has a convolutional stream that uses the raw heart sound signal and a recurrent stream that uses the MFCC features of the signal. The features from these two streams are merged together using a novel attention network and passed through the classification network.

    "abstract": "While various knowledge distillation (KD) methods in CNN-based detectors show their effectiveness in improving small students, the baselines and recipes for DETR-based detectors are yet to be built. In this paper, we focus on the transformer decoder of DETR-based detectors and explore KD methods for them. The outputs of the transformer decoder lie in random order, which gives no direct correspondence between the predictions of the teacher and the student, thus posing a challenge for knowledge distillation. To this end, we propose MixMatcher to align the decoder outputs of DETR-based teachers and students, which mixes two teacher-student matching strategies, i.e., Adaptive Matching and Fixed Matching. Specifically, Adaptive Matching applies bipartite matching to adaptively match the outputs of the teacher and the student in each decoder layer, while Fixed Matching fixes the correspondence between the outputs of the teacher and the student with the same object queries, with the teacher's fixed object queries fed to the decoder of the student as an auxiliary group. Based on MixMatcher, we build \\textbf{D}ecoder \\textbf{D}istillation for \\textbf{DE}tection \\textbf{TR}ansformer (D$^3$ETR), which distills knowledge in decoder predictions and attention maps from the teachers to students. D$^3$ETR shows superior performance on various DETR-based detectors with different backbones. For example, D$^3$ETR improves Conditional DETR-R50-C5 by $\\textbf{7.8}/\\textbf{2.4}$ mAP under $12/50$ epochs training settings with Conditional DETR-R101-C5 as the teacher. ",

    "abstract": "Recent unsupervised multi-object detection models have shown impressive performance improvements, largely attributed to novel architectural inductive biases. Unfortunately, they may produce suboptimal object encodings for downstream tasks. To overcome this, we propose to exploit object motion and continuity, i.e., objects do not pop in and out of existence. This is accomplished through two mechanisms: (i) providing priors on the location of objects through integration of optical flow, and (ii) a contrastive object continuity loss across consecutive image frames. Rather than developing an explicit deep architecture, the resulting Motion and Object Continuity (MOC) scheme can be instantiated using any baseline object detection model. Our results show large improvements in the performances of a SOTA model in terms of object discovery, convergence speed and overall latent object representations, particularly for playing Atari games. Overall, we show clear benefits of integrating motion and object continuity for downstream tasks, moving beyond object representation learning based only on reconstruction. ",

    "abstract": "Compared to query-based black-box attacks, transfer-based black-box attacks do not require any information of the attacked models, which ensures their secrecy. However, most existing transfer-based approaches rely on ensembling multiple models to boost the attack transferability, which is time- and resource-intensive, not to mention the difficulty of obtaining diverse models on the same task. To address this limitation, in this work, we focus on the single-model transfer-based black-box attack on object detection, utilizing only one model to achieve a high-transferability adversarial attack on multiple black-box detectors. Specifically, we first make observations on the patch optimization process of the existing method and propose an enhanced attack framework by slightly adjusting its training strategies. Then, we analogize patch optimization with regular model optimization, proposing a series of self-ensemble approaches on the input data, the attacked model, and the adversarial patch to efficiently make use of the limited information and prevent the patch from overfitting. The experimental results show that the proposed framework can be applied with multiple classical base attack methods (e.g., PGD and MIM) to greatly improve the black-box transferability of the well-optimized patch on multiple mainstream detectors, meanwhile boosting white-box performance.

The goal is to develop a new spectral theory for directed graphs and an alternative spectral theory for hypergraphs. The first main result is a Cheeger inequality relating the vertex expansion $\\vec{\\psi}(G)$ of a directed graph $G$ to the vertex-capacitated maximum reweighted second eigenvalue $\\vec{\\lambda}_2^{v*}$: \\[ \\vec{\\lambda}_2^{v*} \\lesssim \\vec{\\psi}(G) \\lesssim \\sqrt{\\vec{\\lambda}_2^{v*} \\cdot \\log (\\Delta/\\vec{\\lambda}_2^{v*})}. \\] This provides a combinatorial characterization of the fastest mixing time of a directed graph by vertex expansion, and builds a new connection between reweighted eigenvalued, vertex expansion, and fastest mixing time for directed graphs. The second main result is a stronger Cheeger inequality relating the edge conductance $\\vec{\\phi}(G)$ of a directed graph $G$ to the edge-capacitated maximum reweighted second eigenvalue $\\vec{\\lambda}_2^{e*}$: \\[ \\vec{\\lambda}_2^{e*} \\lesssim \\vec{\\phi}(G) \\lesssim \\sqrt{\\vec{\\lambda}_2^{e*} \\cdot \\log (1/\\vec{\\lambda}_2^{e*})}. \\] This provides a certificate for a directed graph to be an expander and a spectral algorithm to find a sparse cut in a directed graph, playing a similar role as Cheeger's inequality in certifying graph expansion and in the spectral partitioning algorithm for undirected graphs. We also use this reweighted eigenvalue approach to derive the improved Cheeger inequality for directed graphs, and furthermore to derive several Cheeger inequalities for hypergraphs that match and improve the existing results in [Lou15,CLTZ18]. These are supporting results that this provides a unifying approach to lift the spectral theory for undirected graphs to more general settings. ",

    "title": "Assessing Neural Network Robustness via Adversarial Pivotal Tuning",
    "abstract": "The ability to assess the robustness of image classifiers to a diverse set of manipulations is essential to their deployment in the real world. Recently, semantic manipulations of real images have been considered for this purpose, as they may not arise using standard adversarial settings. However, such semantic manipulations are often limited to style, color or attribute changes. While expressive, these manipulations do not consider the full capacity of a pretrained generator to affect adversarial image manipulations. In this work, we aim at leveraging the full capacity of a pretrained image generator to generate highly detailed, diverse and photorealistic image manipulations. Inspired by recent GAN-based image inversion methods, we propose a method called Adversarial Pivotal Tuning (APT). APT first finds a pivot latent space input to a pretrained generator that best reconstructs an input image. It then adjusts the weights of the generator to create small, but semantic, manipulations which fool a pretrained classifier. Crucially, APT changes both the input and the weights of the pretrained generator, while preserving its expressive latent editing capability, thus allowing the use of its full capacity in creating semantic adversarial manipulations. We demonstrate that APT generates a variety of semantic image manipulations, which preserve the input image class, but which fool a variety of pretrained classifiers. We further demonstrate that classifiers trained to be robust to other robustness benchmarks, are not robust to our generated manipulations and propose an approach to improve the robustness towards our generated manipulations.

Our framework provides a scalable way for specifying new tasks using only 5-10 demonstrations. Object rearrangement is formalized as the question of finding actions that configure task-relevant parts of the object in a desired alignment. This formalism is implemented in three steps: assigning a consistent local coordinate frame to the task-relevant object parts, determining the location and orientation of this coordinate frame on unseen object instances, and executing an action that brings these frames into the desired alignment. We overcome the key technical challenge of determining task-relevant local coordinate frames from a few demonstrations by developing an optimization method based on Neural Descriptor Fields (NDFs) and a single annotated 3D keypoint. An energy-based learning scheme to model the joint configuration of the objects that satisfies a desired relational task further improves performance. The method is tested on three multi-object rearrangement tasks in simulation and on a real robot. Project website, videos, and code: https://anthonysimeonov.github.io/r-ndf/ ",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on leveraging deep representation learning (DRL) for speech enhancement (SE). In general, the performance of the deep neural network (DNN) is heavily dependent on the learning of data representation. However, the DRL's importance is often ignored in many DNN-based SE algorithms. To obtain a higher quality enhanced speech, we propose a two-stage DRL-based SE method through adversarial training. In the first stage, we disentangle different latent variables because disentangled representations can help DNN generate a better enhanced speech. Specifically, we use the $\\beta$-variational autoencoder (VAE) algorithm to obtain the speech and noise posterior estimations and related representations from the observed signal. However, since the posteriors and representations are intractable and we can only apply a conditional assumption to estimate them, it is difficult to ensure that these estimations are always pretty accurate, which may potentially degrade the final accuracy of the signal estimation. To further improve the quality of enhanced speech, in the second stage, we introduce adversarial training to reduce the effect of the inaccurate posterior towards signal reconstruction and improve the signal estimation accuracy, making our algorithm more robust for the potentially inaccurate posterior estimations. As a result, better SE performance can be achieved. The experimental results indicate that the proposed strategy can help similar DNN-based SE algorithms achieve higher short-time objective intelligibility (STOI), perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ), and scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) scores. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can also outperform recent competitive SE algorithms. ",

There are two main trends to solve that problem: improving the network architecture for better propagation of features through large number of layers and designing an attention mechanism for selecting most informative features. Recent SISR solutions propose advanced attention and self-attention mechanisms. However, constructing a network to use an attention block in the most efficient way is a challenging problem. To address this issue, we propose a general recursively defined residual block (RDRB) for better feature extraction and propagation through network layers. Based on RDRB we designed recursively defined residual network (RDRN), a novel network architecture which utilizes attention blocks efficiently. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on several popular super-resolution benchmarks and outperforms previous methods by up to 0.43 dB. ",

In addition, most social networks are organized so that no individual is more than six connections apart from any other, an empirical regularity known as the six degrees of separation. Why social networks have this ultra-small world organization, whereby the graph's diameter is independent of the network size over several orders of magnitude, is still unknown. Here we show that the 'six degrees of separation' are the property featured by the equilibrium state of any network where individuals weigh between their aspiration to improve their centrality and the costs incurred in forming and maintaining connections. Thus, our results show how simple evolutionary rules of the kind traditionally associated with human cooperation and altruism can also account for the emergence of one of the most intriguing attributes of social networks.

    "abstract": "Line-of-sight link blockages represent a key challenge for the reliability and latency of millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communication networks. To address this challenge, this paper leverages mmWave and LiDAR sensory data to provide awareness about the communication environment and proactively predict dynamic link blockages before they occur. This allows the network to make proactive decisions for hand-off/beam switching, enhancing the network reliability and latency. More specifically, this paper addresses the following key questions: (i) Can we predict a line-of-sight link blockage, before it happens, using in-band mmWave/THz signal and LiDAR sensing data? (ii) Can we also predict when this blockage will occur? (iii) Can we predict the blockage duration? And (iv) can we predict the direction of the moving blockage? For that, we develop machine learning solutions that learn special patterns of the received signal and sensory data, which we call \\textit{pre-blockage signatures}, to infer future blockages. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we build a large-scale real-world dataset that comprises co-existing LiDAR and mmWave communication measurements in outdoor vehicular scenarios. Then, we develop an efficient LiDAR data denoising algorithm that applies some pre-processing to the LiDAR data. Based on the real-world dataset, the developed approaches are shown to achieve above 95\\% accuracy in predicting blockages occurring within 100 ms and more than 80\\% prediction accuracy for blockages occurring within one second. Given this future blockage prediction capability, the paper also shows that the developed solutions can achieve an order of magnitude saving in network latency, which further highlights the potential of the developed blockage prediction solutions for wireless networks.

    "abstract": "Monitoring the performance of machine learning (ML)-based risk prediction models in healthcare is complicated by the issue of confounding medical interventions (CMI): when an algorithm predicts a patient to be at high risk for an adverse event, clinicians are more likely to administer prophylactic treatment and alter the very target that the algorithm aims to predict. Ignoring CMI by monitoring only the untreated patients--whose outcomes remain unaltered--can inflate false alarm rates, because the evolution of both the model and clinician-ML interactions can induce complex dependencies in the data that violate standard assumptions. A more sophisticated approach is to explicitly account for CMI by modeling treatment propensities, but its time-varying nature makes accurate estimation difficult. Given the many sources of complexity in the data, it is important to determine situations in which a simple procedure that ignores CMI provides valid inference. Here we describe the special case of monitoring model calibration, under either the assumption of conditional exchangeability or time-constant selection bias. We introduce a new score-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) chart for monitoring in a frequentist framework and review an alternative approach using Bayesian inference. Through simulations, we investigate the benefits of combining model updating with monitoring and study when over-trust in a prediction model does (or does not) delay detection. Finally, we simulate monitoring an ML-based postoperative nausea and vomiting risk calculator during the COVID-19 pandemic. ",
