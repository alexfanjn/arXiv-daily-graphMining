    "abstract": "Making our research results positively impact on society and environment is one of the goals our community has been pursuing recently. Although financial technology (FinTech) is one of the popular application fields, we notice that there is no discussion on how NLP can help in FinTech for the social good. When mentioning FinTech for social good, people are talking about financial inclusion and green finance. However, the role of NLP in these directions only gets limited discussions. To fill this gap, this paper shares our idea of how we can use NLP in FinTech for social good. We hope readers can rethink the relationship between finance and NLP based on our sharing, and further join us in improving the financial literacy of individual investors and improving the supports for impact investment.

    "title": "Probabilistic Debiasing of Scene Graphs",
    "abstract": "The quality of scene graphs generated by the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models is compromised due to the long-tail nature of the relationships and their parent object pairs. Training of the scene graphs is dominated by the majority relationships of the majority pairs and, therefore, the object-conditional distributions of relationship in the minority pairs are not preserved after the training is converged. Consequently, the biased model performs well on more frequent relationships in the marginal distribution of relationships such as `on' and `wearing', and performs poorly on the less frequent relationships such as `eating' or `hanging from'. In this work, we propose virtual evidence incorporated within-triplet Bayesian Network (BN) to preserve the object-conditional distribution of the relationship label and to eradicate the bias created by the marginal probability of the relationships. The insufficient number of relationships in the minority classes poses a significant problem in learning the within-triplet Bayesian network. We address this insufficiency by embedding-based augmentation of triplets where we borrow samples of the minority triplet classes from its neighborhood triplets in the semantic space. We perform experiments on two different datasets and achieve a significant improvement in the mean recall of the relationships. We also achieve better balance between recall and mean recall performance compared to the SOTA de-biasing techniques of scene graph models. ",

We design SCL-Fish, a supervised contrastive learning integrated meta-learning algorithm to detect abusive language on unseen platforms. Our experimental analysis shows that SCL-Fish achieves better performance over ERM and the existing state-of-the-art models.

    "abstract": "Imitation learning allows social robots to learn new skills from human teachers without substantial manual programming, but it is difficult for robotic imitation learning systems to generalize demonstrated skills as well as human learners do. Contemporary neurocomputational approaches to imitation learning achieve limited generalization at the cost of data-intensive training, and often produce opaque models that are difficult to understand and debug. In this study, we explore the viability of developing purely-neural controllers for social robots that learn to imitate by reasoning about the underlying intentions of demonstrated behaviors. We present NeuroCERIL, a brain-inspired neurocognitive architecture that uses a novel hypothetico-deductive reasoning procedure to produce generalizable and human-readable explanations for demonstrated behavior. This approach combines bottom-up abductive inference with top-down predictive verification, and captures important aspects of human causal reasoning that are relevant to a broad range of cognitive domains. Our empirical results demonstrate that NeuroCERIL can learn various procedural skills in a simulated robotic imitation learning domain. We also show that its causal reasoning procedure is computationally efficient, and that its memory use is dominated by highly transient short-term memories, much like human working memory. We conclude that NeuroCERIL is a viable neural model of human-like imitation learning that can improve human-robot collaboration and contribute to investigations of the neurocomputational basis of human cognition.

    "abstract": "The current paper implements a methodology for automatically detecting vehicle maneuvers from vehicle telemetry data under naturalistic driving settings. Previous approaches have treated vehicle maneuver detection as a classification problem, although both time series segmentation and classification are required since input telemetry data is continuous. Our objective is to develop an end-to-end pipeline for frame-by-frame annotation of naturalistic driving studies videos into various driving events including stop and lane keeping events, lane changes, left-right turning movements, and horizontal curve maneuvers. To address the time series segmentation problem, the study developed an Energy Maximization Algorithm (EMA) capable of extracting driving events of varying durations and frequencies from continuous signal data. To reduce overfitting and false alarm rates, heuristic algorithms were used to classify events with highly variable patterns such as stops and lane-keeping. To classify segmented driving events, four machine learning models were implemented, and their accuracy and transferability were assessed over multiple data sources. The duration of events extracted by EMA were comparable to actual events, with accuracies ranging from 59.30% (left lane change) to 85.60% (lane-keeping). Additionally, the overall accuracy of the 1D-convolutional neural network model was 98.99%, followed by the Long-short-term-memory model at 97.75%, then random forest model at 97.71%, and the support vector machine model at 97.65%. These model accuracies where consistent across different data sources. The study concludes that implementing a segmentation-classification pipeline significantly improves both the accuracy for driver maneuver detection and transferability of shallow and deep ML models across diverse datasets.

    "abstract": "Discriminative unsupervised learning methods such as contrastive learning have demonstrated the ability to learn generalized visual representations on centralized data. It is nonetheless challenging to adapt such methods to a distributed system with unlabeled, private, and heterogeneous client data due to user styles and preferences. Federated learning enables multiple clients to collectively learn a global model without provoking any privacy breach between local clients. On the other hand, another direction of federated learning studies personalized methods to address the local heterogeneity. However, work on solving both generalization and personalization without labels in a decentralized setting remains unfamiliar. In this work, we propose a novel method, FedStyle, to learn a more generalized global model by infusing local style information with local content information for contrastive learning, and to learn more personalized local models by inducing local style information for downstream tasks. The style information is extracted by contrasting original local data with strongly augmented local data (Sobel filtered images). Through extensive experiments with linear evaluations in both IID and non-IID settings, we demonstrate that FedStyle outperforms both the generalization baseline methods and personalization baseline methods in a stylized decentralized setting. Through comprehensive ablations, we demonstrate our design of style infusion and stylized personalization improve performance significantly. ",

The future belongs to those who can best collaborate with artificial cognitive entities achieving a high degree of cognitive augmenta-tion. However, we currently lack theoretically grounded fundamental metrics able to describe human or artificial cognition much less augmented and combined cognition. How do we measure thinking, cognition, information, and knowledge in an implementation-independent way? How can we tell how much thinking an artificial entity does and how much is done by a human? How can we measure the combined and possible even emergent effect of humans working together with intelligent artificial entities? These are some of the challenges for research-ers in this field. We first define a cognitive process as the transformation of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. We then review several existing and emerging information metrics based on entropy, processing effort, quantum physics, emergent capacity, and human concept learning. We then discuss how these fail to answer the above questions and provide guidelines for future re-search. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models develop successive representations of their input in sequential layers, the last of which maps the final representation to the output. Here we investigate the informational content of these representations by observing the ability of convolutional image classification models to autoencode the model's input using embeddings existing in various layers. We find that the deeper the layer, the less accurate that layer's representation of the input is before training. Inaccurate representation results from non-uniqueness in which various distinct inputs give approximately the same embedding. Non-unique representation is a consequence of both exact and approximate non-invertibility of transformations present in the forward pass. Learning to classify natural images leads to an increase in representation clarity for early but not late layers, which instead form abstract images. Rather than simply selecting for features present in the input necessary for classification, deep layer representations are found to transform the input so that it matches representations of the training data such that arbitrary inputs are mapped to manifolds learned during training. This work provides support for the theory that the tasks of image recognition and input generation are inseparable even for models trained exclusively to classify. ",

We view XAI through the lenses of Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) to explicate how diverse stakeholders (relevant social groups) have different interpretations (interpretative flexibility) that shape the meaning of XAI. Forcing a standardization (closure) on the pluralistic interpretations too early can stifle innovation and lead to premature conclusions.

    "abstract": "We investigate the spectral properties of linear-width feed-forward neural networks, where the sample size is asymptotically proportional to network width. Empirically, we show that the weight spectra in this high dimensional regime are invariant when trained by gradient descent for small constant learning rates and the changes in both operator and Frobenius norm are $\\Theta(1)$ in the limit. This implies the bulk spectra for both the conjugate and neural tangent kernels are also invariant. We demonstrate similar characteristics for models trained with mini-batch (stochastic) gradient descent with small learning rates and provide a theoretical justification for this special scenario. When the learning rate is large, we show empirically that an outlier emerges with its corresponding eigenvector aligned to the training data structure. We also show that after adaptive gradient training, where we have a lower test error and feature learning emerges, both the weight and kernel matrices exhibit heavy tail behavior. Different spectral properties such as invariant bulk, spike, and heavy-tailed distribution correlate to how far the kernels deviate from initialization. To understand this phenomenon better, we focus on a toy model, a two-layer network on synthetic data, which exhibits different spectral properties for different training strategies. Analogous phenomena also appear when we train conventional neural networks with real-world data. Our results show that monitoring the evolution of the spectra during training is an important step toward understanding the training dynamics and feature learning. ",

To do so, we provide a framework for bounding the stability and transferability error of GNNs across arbitrary graphs via spectral similarity. By bounding the difference between two graph shift operators (GSOs) in the positive semi-definite sense via their eigenvalue spectrum, we show that this error depends only on the properties of the GNN and the magnitude of spectral similarity of the GSOs. Moreover, we show that existing transferability results that assume the graphs are small perturbations of one another, or that the graphs are random and drawn from the same distribution or sampled from the same graphon can be recovered using our approach. Thus, both GNNs and our HENNs (trained using normalized Laplacians as graph shift operators) will be increasingly stable and transferable as the graphs become larger. Experimental results illustrate the importance of considering multiple graph representations in HENN, and show its superior performance when transferability is desired. ",

    "abstract": "A common challenge in regression is that for many problems, the degrees of freedom required for a high-quality solution also allows for overfitting. Regularization is a class of strategies that seek to restrict the range of possible solutions so as to discourage overfitting while still enabling good solutions, and different regularization strategies impose different types of restrictions. In this paper, we present a multilevel regularization strategy that constructs and trains a hierarchy of neural networks, each of which has layers that are wider versions of the previous network's layers. We draw intuition and techniques from the field of Algebraic Multigrid (AMG), traditionally used for solving linear and nonlinear systems of equations, and specifically adapt the Full Approximation Scheme (FAS) for nonlinear systems of equations to the problem of deep learning. Training through V-cycles then encourage the neural networks to build a hierarchical understanding of the problem. We refer to this approach as \\emph{multilevel-in-width} to distinguish from prior multilevel works which hierarchically alter the depth of neural networks. The resulting approach is a highly flexible framework that can be applied to a variety of layer types, which we demonstrate with both fully-connected and convolutional layers. We experimentally show with PDE regression problems that our multilevel training approach is an effective regularizer, improving the generalize performance of the neural networks studied. ",

These algorithms allow for vertex and edge insertions, interspersed with queries asking whether two vertices belong to the same maximal $3$-edge-connected subgraph, and there is a trade-off between their time- and space-complexity. Specifically, the first algorithm has $O(m\\alpha(m,n) + n^2\\log^2 n)$ total running time and uses $O(n)$ space, where $m$ is the number of edge insertions and queries, and $n$ is the total number of vertices inserted starting from an empty graph. The second algorithm performs the same operations in faster $O(m\\alpha(m,n) + n^2\\alpha(n,n))$ time in total, using $O(n^2)$ space. $(2)$ A fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining information about the maximal $k$-edge-connected subgraphs for fixed $k$.

    "abstract": "Graph structure learning (GSL), which aims to learn the adjacency matrix for graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown great potential in boosting the performance of GNNs. Most existing GSL works apply a joint learning framework where the estimated adjacency matrix and GNN parameters are optimized for downstream tasks. However, as GSL is essentially a link prediction task, whose goal may largely differ from the goal of the downstream task. The inconsistency of these two goals limits the GSL methods to learn the potential optimal graph structure. Moreover, the joint learning framework suffers from scalability issues in terms of time and space during the process of estimation and optimization of the adjacency matrix. To mitigate these issues, we propose a graph structure refinement (GSR) framework with a pretrain-finetune pipeline. Specifically, The pre-training phase aims to comprehensively estimate the underlying graph structure by a multi-view contrastive learning framework with both intra- and inter-view link prediction tasks. Then, the graph structure is refined by adding and removing edges according to the edge probabilities estimated by the pre-trained model. Finally, the fine-tuning GNN is initialized by the pre-trained model and optimized toward downstream tasks. With the refined graph structure remaining static in the fine-tuning space, GSR avoids estimating and optimizing graph structure in the fine-tuning phase which enjoys great scalability and efficiency. Moreover, the fine-tuning GNN is boosted by both migrating knowledge and refining graphs. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness (best performance on six benchmark datasets), efficiency, and scalability (13.8x faster using 32.8% GPU memory compared to the best GSL baseline on Cora) of the proposed model.

    "abstract": "A reliable voice anti-spoofing countermeasure system needs to robustly protect automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems in various kinds of spoofing scenarios. However, the performance of countermeasure systems could be degraded by channel effects and codecs. In this paper, we show that using the low-frequency subbands of signals as input can mitigate the negative impact introduced by codecs on the countermeasure systems. To validate this, two types of low-pass filters with different cut-off frequencies are applied to countermeasure systems, and the equal error rate (EER) is reduced by up to 25% relatively. In addition, we propose a deep learning based bandwidth extension approach to further improve the detection accuracy. Recent studies show that the error rate of countermeasure systems increase dramatically when the silence part is removed by Voice Activity Detection (VAD), our experimental results show that the filtering and bandwidth extension approaches are also effective under the codec condition when VAD is applied.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of position estimation in UAVs operating in a cluttered environment where GPS information is unavailable. A model learning-based approach is proposed that takes in the rotor RPMs and past state as input and predicts the one-step-ahead position of the UAV using a novel spectral-normalized memory neural network (SN-MNN). The spectral normalization guarantees stable and reliable prediction performance. The predicted position is transformed to global coordinate frame which is then fused along with the odometry of other peripheral sensors like IMU, barometer, compass etc., using the onboard extended Kalman filter to estimate the states of the UAV. The experimental flight data collected from a motion capture facility using a micro-UAV is used to train the SN-MNN. The PX4-ECL library is used to replay the flight data using the proposed algorithm, and the estimated position is compared with actual ground truth data. The proposed algorithm doesn't require any additional onboard sensors, and is computationally light. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with the current state-of-art GPS-denied algorithms, and it can be seen that the proposed algorithm has the least RMSE for position estimates. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised speech representation learning aims to extract meaningful factors from the speech signal that can later be used across different downstream tasks, such as speech and/or emotion recognition. Existing models, such as HuBERT, however, can be fairly large thus may not be suitable for edge speech applications. Moreover, realistic applications typically involve speech corrupted by noise and room reverberation, hence models need to provide representations that are robust to such environmental factors. In this study, we build on the so-called DistilHuBERT model, which distils HuBERT to a fraction of its original size, with three modifications, namely: (i) augment the training data with noise and reverberation, while the student model needs to distill the clean representations from the teacher model; (ii) introduce a curriculum learning approach where increasing levels of noise are introduced as the model trains, thus helping with convergence and with the creation of more robust representations; and (iii) introduce a multi-task learning approach where the model also reconstructs the clean waveform jointly with the distillation task, thus also acting as an enhancement step to ensure additional environment robustness to the representation. Experiments on three SUPERB tasks show the advantages of the proposed method not only relative to the original DistilHuBERT, but also to the original HuBERT, thus showing the advantages of the proposed method for ``in the wild'' edge speech applications.

With the development of deep learning, the previous methods have achieved significant improvements. However, most of the existing methods seem to ignore the large perceptive fields and global information. The pioneer method can get significant improvements by only changing training data from the cropped image to the full image. In this paper, we present a single-stage multi-scale network MSLKANet for scene text removal in full images. For obtaining large perceptive fields and global information, we propose multi-scale large kernel attention (MSLKA) to obtain long-range dependencies between the text regions and the backgrounds at various granularity levels. Furthermore, we combine the large kernel decomposition mechanism and atrous spatial pyramid pooling to build a large kernel spatial pyramid pooling (LKSPP), which can perceive more valid pixels in the spatial dimension while maintaining large receptive fields and low cost of computation. Extensive experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets and the effectiveness of the proposed components MSLKA and LKSPP.

A naive baseline is to ignore these sensitive variables in learning decision rules, leading to significant uncertainty and bias. To address this, we propose a decision learning framework to incorporate sensitive variables during offline training but not include them in the input of the learned decision rule during model deployment. Specifically, from a causal perspective, the proposed framework intends to improve the worst-case outcomes of individuals caused by sensitive variables that are unavailable at the time of decision. Unlike most existing literature that uses mean-optimal objectives, we propose a robust learning framework by finding a newly defined quantile- or infimum-optimal decision rule.

Pain assessment in ICU patients still remains a challenge for clinicians and ICU staff, specifically in cases of non-verbal sedated, mechanically ventilated, and intubated patients.

Facial behavior is a major component in observation-based tools. Furthermore, previous literature shows the feasibility of painful facial expression detection using facial action units (AUs). However, these approaches are limited to controlled or semi-controlled environments and have never been validated in clinical settings. In this study, we present our Pain-ICU dataset, the largest dataset available targeting facial behavior analysis in the dynamic ICU environment. Our dataset comprises 76,388 patient facial image frames annotated with AUs obtained from 49 adult patients admitted to ICUs at the University of Florida Health Shands hospital. In this work, we evaluated two vision transformer models, namely ViT and SWIN, for AU detection on our Pain-ICU dataset and also external datasets. We developed a completely end-to-end AU detection pipeline with the objective of performing real-time AU detection in the ICU.

    "abstract": "Vessel segmentation is essential in many medical image applications, such as the detection of coronary stenoses, retinal vessel diseases and brain aneurysms. A high pixel-wise accuracy, complete topology structure and robustness to various contrast variations are three critical aspects of vessel segmentation. However, most existing methods only focus on achieving part of them via dedicated designs while few of them can concurrently achieve the three goals. In this paper, we present a novel affinity feature strengthening network (AFN) which adopts a contrast-insensitive approach based on multiscale affinity to jointly model topology and refine pixel-wise segmentation features. Specifically, for each pixel we derive a multiscale affinity field which captures the semantic relationships of the pixel with its neighbors on the predicted mask image. Such a multiscale affinity field can effectively represent the local topology of a vessel segment of different sizes. Meanwhile, it does not depend on image intensities and hence is robust to various illumination and contrast changes. We further learn spatial- and scale-aware adaptive weights for the corresponding affinity fields to strengthen vessel features. We evaluate our AFN on four different types of vascular datasets: X-ray angiography coronary vessel dataset (XCAD), portal vein dataset (PV), digital subtraction angiography cerebrovascular vessel dataset (DSA) and retinal vessel dataset (DRIVE). Extensive experimental results on the four datasets demonstrate that our AFN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both higher accuracy and topological metrics, and meanwhile is more robust to various contrast changes than existing methods.

Differential privacy (DP) has emerged as one canonical standard for provable privacy. However, DP's strong theoretical guarantees often come at the cost of a large drop in its utility for machine learning, and DP guarantees themselves can be difficult to interpret. In this work, we propose a novel privacy notion, membership inference privacy (MIP), to address these challenges. We give a precise characterization of the relationship between MIP and DP, and show that MIP can be achieved using less amount of randomness compared to the amount required for guaranteeing DP, leading to a smaller drop in utility. MIP guarantees are also easily interpretable in terms of the success rate of membership inference attacks. Our theoretical results also give rise to a simple algorithm for guaranteeing MIP which can be used as a wrapper around any algorithm with a continuous output, including parametric model training. ",

In the task, we aim to learn an inversion function to project an input image to the latent space of a NeRF generator and then synthesize novel views of the original image based on the latent code. Compared with GAN inversion for 2D generative models, NeRF inversion not only needs to 1) preserve the identity of the input image, but also 2) ensure 3D consistency in generated novel views. This requires the latent code obtained from the single-view image to be invariant across multiple views. To address this new challenge, we propose a two-stage encoder for style-based NeRF inversion. In the first stage, we introduce a base encoder that converts the input image to a latent code. To ensure the latent code is view-invariant and is able to synthesize 3D consistent novel view images, we utilize identity contrastive learning to train the base encoder. Second, to better preserve the identity of the input image, we introduce a refining encoder to refine the latent code and add finer details to the output image. Importantly note that the novelty of this model lies in the design of its first-stage encoder which produces the closest latent code lying on the latent manifold and thus the refinement in the second stage would be close to the NeRF manifold. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed two-stage encoder qualitatively and quantitatively exhibits superiority over the existing encoders for inversion in both image reconstruction and novel-view rendering.

    "abstract": "Object detection is an important topic in computer vision, with post-processing, an essential part of the typical object detection pipeline, posing a significant bottleneck affecting the performance of traditional object detection models. The detection transformer (DETR), as the first end-to-end target detection model, discards the requirement of manual components like the anchor and non-maximum suppression (NMS), significantly simplifying the target detection process. However, compared with most traditional object detection models, DETR converges very slowly, and a query's meaning is obscure. Thus, inspired by the Step-by-Step concept, this paper proposes a new two-stage object detection model, named DETR with YOLO (DEYO), which relies on a progressive inference to solve the above problems. DEYO is a two-stage architecture comprising a classic target detection model and a DETR-like model as the first and second stages, respectively. Specifically, the first stage provides high-quality query and anchor feeding into the second stage, improving the performance and efficiency of the second stage compared to the original DETR model. Meanwhile, the second stage compensates for the performance degradation caused by the first stage detector's limitations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DEYO attains 50.6 AP and 52.1 AP in 12 and 36 epochs, respectively, while utilizing ResNet-50 as the backbone and multi-scale features on the COCO dataset. Compared with DINO, an optimal DETR-like model, the developed DEYO model affords a significant performance improvement of 1.6 AP and 1.2 AP in two epoch settings. ",

We identify that deterministic routing is a promising technology to achieve high resource utilization and strict QoE guarantee in NTNs. However, due to the time-varying topology, dynamic bandwidth and long propagation, for establishing deterministic services, it is not only difficult in finding stable end-to-end (E2E) routing, but also complex for joint routing and scheduling. Towards this, we propose an optimal solution based on temporal graphs to enhance resource utilization and service capability of NTNs. First, an extended time-expanded graph (ETEG) with introduced virtual nodes and edges is constructed to uniformly model both heterogeneous resources and traffic requirements. Then, we recast the deterministic routing problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, by linearizing the constraints containing variable-dependent summations, round-down operation and multiplication of nonlinear terms. With the solid upper bound by ILP-based scheduling, we further propose a low-complexity ETEG-based shortest time-featured path algorithm to jointly use transmission and storage resources to support dynamic queuing and cross-cycle transmission of packets, thereby determining the best outgoing link and forwarding cycle hop-by-hop. The optimality and complexity are analyzed, together with simulations to verify the superiority of proposed algorithm in traffic acceptance, E2E delay and running time. ",

In general the goal of this optimization problem is to find the global minimum of the network function. In this paper it is discussed how due to how neural networks are designed, the neural network function present a very large symmetry in the parameter space. This work shows how the neural network function has a number of equivalent minima, in other words minima that give the same value for the loss function and the same exact output, that grows factorially with the number of neurons in each layer for feed forward neural network or with the number of filters in a convolutional neural networks. When the number of neurons and layers is large, the number of equivalent minima grows extremely fast. This will have of course consequences for the study of how neural networks converges to minima during training.

We attribute the over-smoothing problem to the convergence of an arbitrary initial distribution to a stationary distribution. We prove the effectiveness of the previous methods for alleviating the over-smoothing problem. Further, we give the conclusion that operator-consistent GNN cannot avoid over-smoothing at an exponential rate in the Markovian sense. For operator-inconsistent GNN, we theoretically give a sufficient condition for avoiding over-smoothing. Based on this condition, we propose a regularization term which can be flexibly added to the training of the neural network. Finally, we design experiments to verify the effectiveness of this condition. Results show that our proposed sufficient condition not only improves the performance but also alleviates the over-smoothing phenomenon. ",

However, the robustness of GNNs in the presence of label noise remains a largely under-explored problem. In this paper, we consider an important yet challenging scenario where labels on nodes of graphs are not only noisy but also scarce. In this scenario, the performance of GNNs is prone to degrade due to label noise propagation and insufficient learning. To address these issues, we propose a novel RTGNN (Robust Training of Graph Neural Networks via Noise Governance) framework that achieves better robustness by learning to explicitly govern label noise. More specifically, we introduce self-reinforcement and consistency regularization as supplemental supervision. The self-reinforcement supervision is inspired by the memorization effects of deep neural networks and aims to correct noisy labels. Further, the consistency regularization prevents GNNs from overfitting to noisy labels via mimicry loss in both the inter-view and intra-view perspectives. To leverage such supervisions, we divide labels into clean and noisy types, rectify inaccurate labels, and further generate pseudo-labels on unlabeled nodes. Supervision for nodes with different types of labels is then chosen adaptively. This enables sufficient learning from clean labels while limiting the impact of noisy ones. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our RTGNN framework, and the results validate its consistent superior performance over state-of-the-art methods with two types of label noises and various noise rates.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a self-supervised approach to learn universal facial representations from videos, that can transfer across a variety of facial analysis tasks such as Facial Attribute Recognition (FAR), Facial Expression Recognition (FER), DeepFake Detection (DFD), and Lip Synchronization (LS). Our proposed framework, named MARLIN, is a facial video masked autoencoder, that learns highly robust and generic facial embeddings from abundantly available non-annotated web crawled facial videos. As a challenging auxiliary task, MARLIN reconstructs the spatio-temporal details of the face from the densely masked facial regions which mainly include eyes, nose, mouth, lips, and skin to capture local and global aspects that in turn help in encoding generic and transferable features. Through a variety of experiments on diverse downstream tasks, we demonstrate MARLIN to be an excellent facial video encoder as well as feature extractor, that performs consistently well across a variety of downstream tasks including FAR (1.13% gain over supervised benchmark), FER (2.64% gain over unsupervised benchmark), DFD (1.86% gain over unsupervised benchmark), LS (29.36% gain for Frechet Inception Distance), and even in low data regime. Our codes and pre-trained models will be made public. ",

    "abstract": "Data-driven Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) have the potential to improve and standardise care with personalised probabilistic guidance. However, the size of data required necessitates collaborative learning from analogous CDSS's, which are often unsharable or imperfectly interoperable (IIO), meaning their feature sets are not perfectly overlapping. We propose Modular Clinical Decision Support Networks (MoDN) which allow flexible, privacy-preserving learning across IIO datasets, while providing interpretable, continuous predictive feedback to the clinician. MoDN is a novel decision tree composed of feature-specific neural network modules. It creates dynamic personalised representations of patients, and can make multiple predictions of diagnoses, updatable at each step of a consultation. The modular design allows it to compartmentalise training updates to specific features and collaboratively learn between IIO datasets without sharing any data. ",

    "abstract": "Considerable research attention has been paid to table detection by developing not only rule-based approaches reliant on hand-crafted heuristics but also deep learning approaches. Although recent studies successfully perform table detection with enhanced results, they often experience performance degradation when they are used for transferred domains whose table layout features might differ from the source domain in which the underlying model has been trained. To overcome this problem, we present DATa, a novel Domain Adaptation-aided deep Table detection method that guarantees satisfactory performance in a specific target domain where few trusted labels are available. To this end, we newly design lexical features and an augmented model used for re-training. More specifically, after pre-training one of state-of-the-art vision-based models as our backbone network, we re-train our augmented model, consisting of the vision-based model and the multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture. Using new confidence scores acquired based on the trained MLP architecture as well as an initial prediction of bounding boxes and their confidence scores, we calculate each confidence score more accurately. To validate the superiority of DATa, we perform experimental evaluations by adopting a real-world benchmark dataset in a source domain and another dataset in our target domain consisting of materials science articles. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DATa method substantially outperforms competing methods that only utilize visual representations in the target domain. Such gains are possible owing to the capability of eliminating high false positives or false negatives according to the setting of a confidence score threshold. ",

    "abstract": "Many real-world systems give rise to a time series of symbols. The elements in a sequence can be generated by agents walking over a networked space so that whenever a node is visited the corresponding symbol is generated. In many situations the underlying network is hidden, and one aims to recover its original structure and/or properties. For example, when analyzing texts, the underlying network structure generating a particular sequence of words is not available. In this paper, we analyze whether one can recover the underlying local properties of networks generating sequences of symbols for different combinations of random walks and network topologies. We found that the reconstruction performance is influenced by the bias of the agent dynamics. When the walker is biased toward high-degree neighbors, the best performance was obtained for most of the network models and properties. Surprisingly, this same effect is not observed for the clustering coefficient and eccentric, even when large sequences are considered. We also found that the true self-avoiding displayed similar performance as the one preferring highly-connected nodes, with the advantage of yielding competitive performance to recover the clustering coefficient. Our results may have implications for the construction and interpretation of networks generated from sequences. ",

Moreover, we show that it combines well with anomaly scores from standard parametric approaches, and we find that transformer features are particularly well suited to detect novel objects in combination with k-Nearest-Neighbors. Ultimately, the approach is simple and non-invasive, i.e., it does not affect the primary segmentation performance, avoids training on examples of anomalies, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the common benchmarks with +23% and +16% AP improvements on on RoadAnomaly and StreetHazards respectively.

The abundance of real-time traffic is evident in the popularity of applications like video and audio conferencing, which increased significantly during the COVID-19 period. We propose a sharing and scheduling policy which involves dynamically sharing a portion of one operator's bandwidth with another operator. We provide strong theoretical guarantees for the policy. We also evaluate its performance via extensive simulations, which show significant improvements of up to 90% in the ability to carry real-time traffic when using the policy. We also explore how the improvements from bandwidth sharing depend on the amount of sharing, and on additional traffic characteristics. ",

However, these systems require the use of sensitive customer transaction data, which introduces both a lack of privacy for the customer and a data breach vulnerability to the card provider. This paper proposes a system for private fraud detection on encrypted transactions using homomorphic encryption. Two models, XGBoost and a feedforward classifier neural network, are trained as fraud detectors on plaintext data. They are then converted to models which use homomorphic encryption for private inference. Latency, storage, and detection results are discussed, along with use cases and feasibility of deployment. The XGBoost model has better performance, with an encrypted inference as low as 6ms, compared to 296ms for the neural network. However, the neural network implementation may still be preferred, as it is simpler to deploy securely. A codebase for the system is also provided, for simulation and further development. ",

    "abstract": "Post-click conversion rate (CVR) prediction is an essential task for discovering user interests and increasing platform revenues in a range of industrial applications. One of the most challenging problems of this task is the existence of severe selection bias caused by the inherent self-selection behavior of users and the item selection process of systems. Currently, doubly robust (DR) learning approaches achieve the state-of-the-art performance for debiasing CVR prediction. However, in this paper, by theoretically analyzing the bias, variance and generalization bounds of DR methods, we find that existing DR approaches may have poor generalization caused by inaccurate estimation of propensity scores and imputation errors, which often occur in practice. Motivated by such analysis, we propose a generalized learning framework that not only unifies existing DR methods, but also provides a valuable opportunity to develop a series of new debiasing techniques to accommodate different application scenarios. Based on the framework, we propose two new DR methods, namely DR-BIAS and DR-MSE. DR-BIAS directly controls the bias of DR loss, while DR-MSE balances the bias and variance flexibly, which achieves better generalization performance. In addition, we propose a novel tri-level joint learning optimization method for DR-MSE in CVR prediction, and an efficient training algorithm correspondingly. We conduct extensive experiments on both real-world and semi-synthetic datasets, which validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. ",

In this paper, we propose a Tree-structured Implicit Neural Compression (TINC) to conduct compact representation for local regions and extract the shared features of these local representations in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, we use MLPs to fit the partitioned local regions, and these MLPs are organized in tree structure to share parameters according to the spatial distance. The parameter sharing scheme not only ensures the continuity between adjacent regions, but also jointly removes the local and non-local redundancy. Extensive experiments show that TINC improves the compression fidelity of INR, and has shown impressive compression capabilities over commercial tools and other deep learning based methods. Besides, the approach is of high flexibility and can be tailored for different data and parameter settings. All the reproducible codes are going to be released on github. ",

An automated mechanism for detecting pain could improve sedation dose titration. Previous studies on facial pain detection have shown the viability of computer vision methods in detecting pain in unoccluded faces. However, the faces of patients undergoing procedures are often partially occluded by medical devices and face masks. A previous preliminary study on pain detection on artificially occluded faces has shown a feasible approach to detect pain from a narrow band around the eyes. This study has collected video data from masked faces of 14 patients undergoing procedures in an interventional radiology department and has trained a deep learning model using this dataset. The model was able to detect expressions of pain accurately and, after causal temporal smoothing, achieved an average precision (AP) of 0.72 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.82. These results outperform baseline models and show viability of computer vision approaches for pain detection of masked faces during procedural sedation. Cross-dataset performance is also examined when a model is trained on a publicly available dataset and tested on the sedation videos. The ways in which pain expressions differ in the two datasets are qualitatively examined. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel Neural Sewing Machine (NSM), a learning-based framework for structure-preserving 3D garment modeling, which is capable of learning representations for garments with diverse shapes and topologies and is successfully applied to 3D garment reconstruction and controllable manipulation. To model generic garments, we first obtain sewing pattern embedding via a unified sewing pattern encoding module, as the sewing pattern can accurately describe the intrinsic structure and the topology of the 3D garment. Then we use a 3D garment decoder to decode the sewing pattern embedding into a 3D garment using the UV-position maps with masks. To preserve the intrinsic structure of the predicted 3D garment, we introduce an inner-panel structure-preserving loss, an inter-panel structure-preserving loss, and a surface-normal loss in the learning process of our framework. We evaluate NSM on the public 3D garment dataset with sewing patterns with diverse garment shapes and categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed NSM is capable of representing 3D garments under diverse garment shapes and topologies, realistically reconstructing 3D garments from 2D images with the preserved structure, and accurately manipulating the 3D garment categories, shapes, and topologies, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin.

Specifically, we apply DeepJSCC to two basic modes of cooperative communications, namely amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF). In DeepJSCC-AF, the relay simply amplifies and forwards its received signal. In DeepJSCC-DF, on the other hand, the relay first reconstructs the transmitted image and then re-encodes it before forwarding. Considering the excessive computation overhead of DeepJSCC-DF for recovering the image at the relay, we propose an alternative scheme, called DeepJSCC-PF, in which the relay processes and forwards its received signal without necessarily recovering the image. Simulation results show that the proposed DeepJSCC-AF, DF, and PF schemes are superior to the digital baselines with BPG compression with polar codes and provides a graceful performance degradation with deteriorating channel quality. Further investigation shows that the PSNR gain of DeepJSCC-DF/PF over DeepJSCC-AF improves as the channel condition between the source and relay improves. Moreover, DeepJSCC-PF scheme achieves a similar performance to DeepJSCC-DF with lower computational complexity. ",

    "title": "Integrating Transformer and Autoencoder Techniques with Spectral Graph  Algorithms for the Prediction of Scarcely Labeled Molecular Data",
    "abstract": "In molecular and biological sciences, experiments are expensive, time-consuming, and often subject to ethical constraints. Consequently, one often faces the challenging task of predicting desirable properties from small data sets or scarcely-labeled data sets. Although transfer learning can be advantageous, it requires the existence of a related large data set. This work introduces three graph-based models incorporating Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) techniques to tackle this challenge. Specifically, graph-based modifications of the MBO scheme is integrated with state-of-the-art techniques, including a home-made transformer and an autoencoder, in order to deal with scarcely-labeled data sets. In addition, a consensus technique is detailed. The proposed models are validated using five benchmark data sets. We also provide a thorough comparison to other competing methods, such as support vector machines, random forests, and gradient boosted decision trees, which are known for their good performance on small data sets. The performances of various methods are analyzed using residue-similarity (R-S) scores and R-S indices. Extensive computational experiments and theoretical analysis show that the new models perform very well even when as little as 1% of the data set is used as labeled data. ",

    "abstract": "This paper uses a simple state machine to develop a control algorithm for controlling an infant humanoid in the context of a simple model system. The algorithm is inspired by a baby who starts learning to stand and walk at 7 to 12 months of age: he or she initially learns to crawl and then, once the lower limb muscles are strong enough, can learn to walk by coming to support his or her upper trunk. Ideally, this algorithm-supported locomotion can take the baby to any desired location: a pile of toys, a tasty snack, or the baby's parents or relatives. In this paper we analyze the crawling stage, the simple 2d bipedal model, and the initial walking form from 8 to 18 months of age, and quantitatively evaluate the ideal kinematics model and simulation results for these stages.

In this study, we propose a novel textual data augmentation method to generate artificial clinical notes in patients' Electronic Health Records (EHRs) that can be used as additional training data for patient outcomes prediction. Essentially, we fine-tune the generative language model GPT-2 to synthesize labeled text with the original training data. More specifically, We propose a teacher-student framework where we first pre-train a teacher model on the original data, and then train a student model on the GPT-augmented data under the guidance of the teacher. We evaluate our method on the most common patient outcome, i.e., the 30-day readmission rate. The experimental results show that deep models can improve their predictive performance with the augmented data, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. ",

    "abstract": "As the popularity of graph data increases, there is a growing need to count the occurrences of subgraph patterns of interest, for a variety of applications. Many graphs are massive in scale and also fully dynamic (with insertions and deletions of edges), rendering exact computation of these counts to be infeasible. Common practice is, instead, to use a small set of edges as a sample to estimate the counts. Existing sampling algorithms for fully dynamic graphs sample the edges with uniform probability. In this paper, we show that we can do much better if we sample edges based on their individual properties. Specifically, we propose a weighted sampling algorithm called WSD for estimating the subgraph count in a fully dynamic graph stream, which samples the edges based on their weights that indicate their importance and reflect their properties. We determine the weights of edges in a data-driven fashion, using a novel method based on reinforcement learning. We conduct extensive experiments to verify that our technique can produce estimates with smaller errors while often running faster compared with existing algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "Much of the value that IoT (Internet-of-Things) devices bring to ``smart'' homes lies in their ability to automatically trigger other devices' actions: for example, a smart camera triggering a smart lock to unlock a door. Manually setting up these rules for smart devices or applications, however, is time-consuming and inefficient. Rule recommendation systems can automatically suggest rules for users by learning which rules are popular based on those previously deployed (e.g., in others' smart homes). Conventional recommendation formulations require a central server to record the rules used in many users' homes, which compromises their privacy and leaves them vulnerable to attacks on the central server's database of rules. Moreover, these solutions typically leverage generic user-item matrix methods that do not fully exploit the structure of the rule recommendation problem. In this paper, we propose a new rule recommendation system, dubbed as FedRule, to address these challenges. One graph is constructed per user upon the rules s/he is using, and the rule recommendation is formulated as a link prediction task in these graphs. This formulation enables us to design a federated training algorithm that is able to keep users' data private. Extensive experiments corroborate our claims by demonstrating that FedRule has comparable performance as the centralized setting and outperforms conventional solutions. ",

    "abstract": "Quantization approximates a deep network model with floating-point numbers by the one with low bit width numbers, in order to accelerate inference and reduce computation. Quantizing a model without access to the original data, zero-shot quantization can be accomplished by fitting the real data distribution by data synthesis. However, zero-shot quantization achieves inferior performance compared to the post-training quantization with real data. We find it is because: 1) a normal generator is hard to obtain high diversity of synthetic data, since it lacks long-range information to allocate attention to global features; 2) the synthetic images aim to simulate the statistics of real data, which leads to weak intra-class heterogeneity and limited feature richness. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel deep network quantizer, dubbed Long-Range Zero-Shot Generative Deep Network Quantization (LRQ). Technically, we propose a long-range generator to learn long-range information instead of simple local features. In order for the synthetic data to contain more global features, long-range attention using large kernel convolution is incorporated into the generator. In addition, we also present an Adversarial Margin Add (AMA) module to force intra-class angular enlargement between feature vector and class center. As AMA increases the convergence difficulty of the loss function, which is opposite to the training objective of the original loss function, it forms an adversarial process. Furthermore, in order to transfer knowledge from the full-precision network, we also utilize a decoupled knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LRQ obtains better performance than other competitors. ",

This leads to a study of mass conservation in flow models and the inheritance of conservation at the network level when present at each component. Conservation is expressed as a transfer function property at DC. This property then is shown to imply the existence of integrators and other DC structure of the network model, which has important consequences for the subsequent control design. An example based on an industrial system is used to explore the facility of moving from modeling to automated interconnection or components to model reduction to digital controller design and performance evaluation. Throughout, the focus is on the teasing out of control orientation in modeling. The example shows a strong connection between the modeling and the controller design. ",

Existing crowd-counting methods assume that the training annotation points were accurate and thus ignore the fact that noisy annotations can lead to large model-learning bias and counting error, especially for counting highly dense crowds that appear far away. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to properly handle such noise at multiple scales in end-to-end loss design and thus push the crowd counting state-of-the-art. We model the noise of crowd annotation points as a Gaussian and derive the crowd probability density map from the input image. We then approximate the joint distribution of crowd density maps with the full covariance of multiple scales and derive a low-rank approximation for tractability and efficient implementation. The derived scale-aware loss function is used to train the SPF-Net. We show that it outperforms various loss functions on four public datasets: UCF-QNRF, UCF CC 50, NWPU and ShanghaiTech A-B datasets. The proposed SPF-Net can accurately predict the locations of people in the crowd, despite training on noisy training annotations. ",

Considering that masking is a kind of corruption, in this work we explore a more general denoising autoencoder for point cloud learning (Point-DAE) by investigating more types of corruptions beyond masking. Specifically, we degrade the point cloud with certain corruptions as input, and learn an encoder-decoder model to reconstruct the original point cloud from its corrupted version. Three corruption families (i.e., density/masking, noise, and affine transformation) and a total of fourteen corruption types are investigated. Interestingly, the affine transformation-based Point-DAE generally outperforms others (e.g., the popular masking corruptions), suggesting a promising direction for self-supervised point cloud learning. More importantly, we find a statistically significant linear relationship between task relatedness and model performance on downstream tasks. This finding partly demystifies the advantage of affine transformation-based Point-DAE, given that such Point-DAE variants are closely related to the downstream classification task. Additionally, we reveal that most Point-DAE variants unintentionally benefit from the manually-annotated canonical poses in the pre-training dataset. To tackle such an issue, we promote a new dataset setting by estimating object poses automatically. The codes will be available at \\url{https://github.com/YBZh/Point-DAE.} ",

In order to constrain the functions that should be learned by each layer, we employ a sparsity regularization term, manifold regularization term and a physics-informed term. We derive the necessary conditions for trainability of a newly added layer and analyze the role of manifold regularization. In the second stage of the Algorithm, a sequential learning process is adopted where a sequence of small networks is employed to extract information from the residual produced in stage I and thereby making robust and more accurate predictions. Numerical investigations with fully connected network on prototype regression problem, and classification problem demonstrate that the proposed approach can outperform adhoc baseline networks.

To achieve the optimal resource allocation, we formulate the social welfare maximization problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and decompose it into two stages involving the allocation and execution of offloaded tasks. The first stage is solved by extending the well-known Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. For the second stage, we first show that we only need to decide the processing order of tasks and the utilized computational resources. After that, we propose a dynamic programming and a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based algorithm to solve the two types of decisions, respectively.

    "abstract": "Incremental or continual learning has been extensively studied for image classification tasks to alleviate catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon that earlier learned knowledge is forgotten when learning new concepts. For class incremental semantic segmentation, such a phenomenon often becomes much worse due to the background shift, i.e., some concepts learned at previous stages are assigned to the background class at the current training stage, therefore, significantly reducing the performance of these old concepts. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method in this paper, named Mining unseen Classes via Regional Objectness for Segmentation (MicroSeg). Our MicroSeg is based on the assumption that background regions with strong objectness possibly belong to those concepts in the historical or future stages. Therefore, to avoid forgetting old knowledge at the current training stage, our MicroSeg first splits the given image into hundreds of segment proposals with a proposal generator. Those segment proposals with strong objectness from the background are then clustered and assigned newly-defined labels during the optimization. In this way, the distribution characterizes of old concepts in the feature space could be better perceived, relieving the catastrophic forgetting caused by the background shift accordingly. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and ADE20K datasets show competitive results with state-of-the-art, well validating the effectiveness of the proposed MicroSeg. ",

Furthermore, we show that SCOTCH and SODA significantly outperforms existing techniques for video shadow detection. Code will be available upon the acceptance of this work. ",

    "abstract": "Influenced by the advances in data and computing, the scientific practice increasingly involves machine learning and artificial intelligence driven methods which requires specialized capabilities at the system-, science- and service-level in addition to the conventional large-capacity supercomputing approaches. The latest distributed architectures built around the composability of data-centric applications led to the emergence of a new ecosystem for container coordination and integration. However, there is still a divide between the application development pipelines of existing supercomputing environments, and these new dynamic environments that disaggregate fluid resource pools through accessible, portable and re-programmable interfaces. New approaches for dynamic composability of heterogeneous systems are needed to further advance the data-driven scientific practice for the purpose of more efficient computing and usable tools for specific scientific domains. In this paper, we present a novel approach for using composable systems in the intersection between scientific computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and remote sensing domain. We describe the architecture of a first working example of a composable infrastructure that federates Expanse, an NSF-funded supercomputer, with Nautilus, a Kubernetes-based GPU geo-distributed cluster. We also summarize a case study in wildfire modeling, that demonstrates the application of this new infrastructure in scientific workflows: a composed system that bridges the insights from edge sensing, AI and computing capabilities with a physics-driven simulation.

    "abstract": "Causal structure learning has been extensively studied and widely used in machine learning and various applications. To achieve an ideal performance, existing causal structure learning algorithms often need to centralize a large amount of data from multiple data sources. However, in the privacy-preserving setting, it is impossible to centralize data from all sources and put them together as a single dataset. To preserve data privacy, federated learning as a new learning paradigm has attached much attention in machine learning in recent years. In this paper, we study a privacy-aware causal structure learning problem in the federated setting and propose a novel Federated PC (FedPC) algorithm with two new strategies for preserving data privacy without centralizing data. Specifically, we first propose a novel layer-wise aggregation strategy for a seamless adaptation of the PC algorithm into the federated learning paradigm for federated skeleton learning, then we design an effective strategy for learning consistent separation sets for federated edge orientation. The extensive experiments validate that FedPC is effective for causal structure learning in federated learning setting. ",

    "abstract": "Multimodal recommender systems utilizing multimodal features (e.g. images and textual descriptions) typically show better recommendation accuracy than general recommendation models based solely on user-item interactions. Generally, prior work fuses multimodal features into item ID embeddings to enrich item representations, thus failing to capture the latent semantic item-item structures. In this context, LATTICE [1] proposes to learn the latent structure between items explicitly and achieves state-of-the-art performance for multimodal recommendations. However, we argue the latent graph structure learning of LATTICE is both inefficient and unnecessary. Experimentally, we demonstrate that freezing its item-item structure before training can also achieve competitive performance. Based on this finding, we propose a simple yet effective model, dubbed as FREEDOM, that FREEzes the item-item graph and DenOises the user-item interaction graph simultaneously for Multimodal recommendation. In denoising the user-item interaction graph, we devise a degree-sensitive edge pruning method, which rejects possibly noisy edges with a high probability when sampling the graph. We evaluate the proposed model on three real-world datasets and show that FREEDOM can significantly outperform the strongest baselines. Compared with LATTICE, FREEDOM achieves an average improvement of 19.07\\% in recommendation accuracy while reducing its memory cost up to 6$\\times$ on large graphs.

The EW-GNN decoder operates on the Tanner graph with an iterative message-passing structure, which algorithmically aligns with the conventional belief propagation (BP) decoding method. In each iteration, the \"weight\" on the message passed along each edge is obtained from a fully connected neural network that has the reliability information from nodes/edges as its input. Compared to existing deep-learning-based decoding schemes, the EW-GNN decoder is characterised by its scalability, meaning that 1) the number of trainable parameters is independent of the codeword length, and 2) an EW-GNN decoder trained with shorter/simple codes can be directly used for longer/sophisticated codes of different code rates. Furthermore, simulation results show that the EW-GNN decoder outperforms the BP and deep-learning-based BP methods from the literature in terms of the decoding error rate. ",

To identify fraudulent communities, Grab, one of the largest technology companies in Southeast Asia, forms a graph from a set of transactions and detects dense subgraphs arising from abnormally large numbers of connections among fraudsters. Existing dense subgraph detection approaches focus on static graphs without considering the fact that transaction graphs are highly dynamic. Moreover, detecting dense subgraphs from scratch with graph updates is time consuming and cannot meet the real-time requirement in industry. To address this problem, we introduce an incremental real-time fraud detection framework called Spade. Spade can detect fraudulent communities in hundreds of microseconds on million-scale graphs by incrementally maintaining dense subgraphs. Furthermore, Spade supports batch updates and edge grouping to reduce response latency. Lastly, Spade provides simple but expressive APIs for the design of evolving fraud detection semantics. Developers plug their customized suspiciousness functions into Spade which incrementalizes their semantics without recasting their algorithms. Extensive experiments show that Spade detects fraudulent communities in real time on million-scale graphs. Peeling algorithms incrementalized by Spade are up to a million times faster than the static version. ",

Therefore, network compression technologies like binarization are studied to deploy KWS models on edge. In this paper, we present a strong yet efficient binary neural network for KWS, namely BiFSMNv2, pushing it to the real-network accuracy performance. First, we present a Dual-scale Thinnable 1-bit-Architecture to recover the representation capability of the binarized computation units by dual-scale activation binarization and liberate the speedup potential from an overall architecture perspective. Second, we also construct a Frequency Independent Distillation scheme for KWS binarization-aware training, which distills the high and low-frequency components independently to mitigate the information mismatch between full-precision and binarized representations. Moreover, we implement BiFSMNv2 on ARMv8 real-world hardware with a novel Fast Bitwise Computation Kernel, which is proposed to fully utilize registers and increase instruction throughput. Comprehensive experiments show our BiFSMNv2 outperforms existing binary networks for KWS by convincing margins across different datasets and even achieves comparable accuracy with the full-precision networks (e.g., only 1.59% drop on Speech Commands V1-12). We highlight that benefiting from the compact architecture and optimized hardware kernel, BiFSMNv2 can achieve an impressive 25.1x speedup and 20.2x storage-saving on edge hardware. ",

Our proposed ``autovocoder'' reverses this arrangement. We use machine learning to obtain a representation that replaces the mel-spectrogram, and that can be inverted back to a waveform using simple, fast operations including a differentiable implementation of the inverse STFT. The autovocoder generates a waveform 5 times faster than the DSP-based Griffin-Lim algorithm, and 14 times faster than the neural vocoder HiFi-GAN.

In this paper, we consider the problem of correlation clustering for dynamic complete signed graphs where (1) a vertex can be added or deleted, and (2) the sign of an edge can be flipped. In the proposed online scheme, the offline approximation algorithm in [CALM+21] for correlation clustering is used. Up to the author's knowledge, this is the first online algorithm for dynamic graphs which allows a full set of graph editing operations. The proposed approach is rigorously analyzed and compared with a baseline method, which runs the original offline algorithm on each time step. Our results show that the dynamic operations have local effects on the neighboring vertices and we employ this locality to reduce the dependency of the running time in the Baseline to the summation of the degree of all vertices in $G_t$, the graph after applying the graph edit operation at time step $t$, to the summation of the degree of the changing vertices (e.g. two endpoints of an edge) and the number of clusters in the previous time step. Moreover, the required working memory is reduced to the square of the summation of the degree of the modified edge endpoints rather than the total number of vertices in the graph. ",

We assess the sensitivity score on a set of representative words in the test set using two classifiers trained for hospital readmission classification with similar performance statistics. Our experiments compare the decision-making logic of clinicians and classifiers based on rank correlations of sensitivity scores. The results indicate that the language model's sensitivity score aligns better with the professionals than the xgboost classifier on tf-idf embeddings, which suggests that xgboost uses some spurious features. Overall, this metric offers a novel perspective on assessing models' robustness by quantifying their discrepancy with professional opinions.

Previous semi-supervised 3D object detection methods directly follow the practice of fully-supervised methods to augment labeled and unlabeled data, which is sub-optimal. In this paper, we design a data augmentation method for semi-supervised learning, which we call Semi-Sampling. Specifically, we use ground truth labels and pseudo labels to crop gt samples and pseudo samples on labeled frames and unlabeled frames, respectively. Then we can generate a gt sample database and a pseudo sample database. When training a teacher-student semi-supervised framework, we randomly select gt samples and pseudo samples to both labeled frames and unlabeled frames, making a strong data augmentation for them. Our semi-sampling can be regarded as an extension of gt-sampling to semi-supervised learning. Our method is simple but effective. We consistently improve state-of-the-art methods on ScanNet, SUN-RGBD, and KITTI benchmarks by large margins. For example, when training using only 10% labeled data on ScanNet, we achieve 3.1 mAP and 6.4 mAP improvement upon 3DIoUMatch in terms of mAP@0.25 and mAP@0.5. When training using only 1% labeled data on KITTI, we boost 3DIoUMatch by 3.5 mAP, 6.7 mAP and 14.1 mAP on car, pedestrian and cyclist classes.

In this paper, we propose a method that does not demand any 3D annotation, while being able to predict full-oriented 3D bounding boxes. Our method, called Recursive Cross-View (RCV), transforms 3D detection into several 2D detection tasks, which only consume some 2D labels, based on the three-view principle. We propose a recursive paradigm, in which instance segmentation and 3D bounding box generation by Cross-View are implemented recursively until convergence. Specifically, a frustum is proposed via a 2D detector, followed by the recursive paradigm that finally outputs a full-oriented 3D box, class, and score. To justify that our method can be quickly used to new tasks in real-world scenarios, we do three experiments, namely indoor 3D human detection, full-oriented 3D hand detection, and real-time detection on a real 3D sensor. RCV achieves decent performance in these experiments. Once trained, our method can be viewed as a 3D annotation tool. Consequently, we formulate two 3D labeled dataset, namely '3D_HUMAN' and 'D_HAND', based on RCV, which could be used to pre-train other 3D detectors. Furthermore, estimated on the SUN RGB-D benchmark, our method achieves comparable performance with some full 3D supervised learning methods. RCV is the first 3D detection method that does not consume 3D labels and yields full-oriented 3D boxes on point clouds. ",

    "abstract": "Metric learning aims to build a distance metric typically by learning an effective embedding function that maps similar objects into nearby points in its embedding space. Despite recent advances in deep metric learning, it remains challenging for the learned metric to generalize to unseen classes with a substantial domain gap. To tackle the issue, we explore a new problem of few-shot metric learning that aims to adapt the embedding function to the target domain with only a few annotated data. We introduce three few-shot metric learning baselines and propose the Channel-Rectifier Meta-Learning (CRML), which effectively adapts the metric space online by adjusting channels of intermediate layers. Experimental analyses on miniImageNet, CUB-200-2011, MPII, as well as a new dataset, miniDeepFashion, demonstrate that our method consistently improves the learned metric by adapting it to target classes and achieves a greater gain in image retrieval when the domain gap from the source classes is larger.

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL) is a form of self-supervised learning and has been widely used for various tasks. Different from widely studied instance-level contrastive learning, pixel-wise contrastive learning mainly helps with pixel-wise tasks such as medical landmark detection. The counterpart to an instance in instance-level CL is a pixel, along with its neighboring context, in pixel-wise CL. Aiming to build better feature representation, there is a vast literature about designing instance augmentation strategies for instance-level CL; but there is little similar work on pixel augmentation for pixel-wise CL with a pixel granularity. In this paper, we attempt to bridge this gap. We first classify a pixel into three categories, namely low-, medium-, and high-informative, based on the information quantity the pixel contains. Inspired by the ``InfoMin\" principle, we then design separate augmentation strategies for each category in terms of augmentation intensity and sampling ratio. Extensive experiments validate that our information-guided pixel augmentation strategy succeeds in encoding more discriminative representations and surpassing other competitive approaches in unsupervised local feature matching. Furthermore, our pretrained model improves the performance of both one-shot and fully supervised models. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a pixel augmentation method with a pixel granularity for enhancing unsupervised pixel-wise contrastive learning. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning can generate black-box surrogate models which are both extremely fast and highly accurate. Rigorously verifying the accuracy of these black-box models, however, is computationally challenging. When it comes to power systems, learning AC power flow is the cornerstone of any machine learning surrogate model wishing to drastically accelerate computations, whether it is for optimization, control, or dynamics. This paper develops for the first time, to our knowledge, a tractable neural network verification procedure which incorporates the ground truth of the \\emph{non-linear} AC power flow equations to determine worst-case neural network performance. Our approach, termed Sequential Targeted Tightening (STT), leverages a loosely convexified reformulation of the original verification problem, which is a mixed integer quadratic program (MIQP). Using the sequential addition of targeted cuts, we iteratively tighten our formulation until either the solution is sufficiently tight or a satisfactory performance guarantee has been generated. After learning neural network models of the 14, 57, 118, and 200-bus PGLib test cases, we compare the performance guarantees generated by our STT procedure with ones generated by a state-of-the-art MIQP solver, Gurobi 9.5. We show that STT often generates performance guarantees which are orders of magnitude tighter than the MIQP upper bound. ",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) with quantization and deliberately added noise over wireless networks is a promising approach to preserve the user differential privacy while reducing the wireless resources. Specifically, an FL learning process can be fused with quantized Binomial mechanism-based updates contributed by multiple users to reduce the communication overhead/cost as well as to protect the privacy of {participating} users. However, the optimization of wireless transmission and quantization parameters (e.g., transmit power, bandwidth, and quantization bits) as well as the added noise while guaranteeing the privacy requirement and the performance of the learned FL model remains an open and challenging problem. In this paper, we aim to jointly optimize the level of quantization, parameters of the Binomial mechanism, and devices' transmit powers to minimize the training time under the constraints of the wireless networks. The resulting optimization turns out to be a Mixed Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) problem, which is known to be NP-hard. To tackle it, we transform this MINLP problem into a new problem whose solutions are proved to be the optimal solutions of the original one. We then propose an approximate algorithm that can solve the transformed problem with an arbitrary relative error guarantee. Intensive simulations show that for the same wireless resources the proposed approach achieves the highest accuracy, close to that of the standard FL with no quantization and no noise added. This suggests the faster convergence/training time of the proposed wireless FL framework while optimally preserving users' privacy. ",

Against these issues, we propose a novel triple domain model-driven CTMAR network, termed as TriDoNet, whose network training exploits triple domain knowledge, i.e., the knowledge of the sinogram, CT image, and metal artifact domains. Specifically, to explore the non-local repetitive streaking patterns of metal artifacts, we encode them as an explicit tight frame sparse representation model with adaptive thresholds. Furthermore, we design a contrastive regularization (CR) built upon contrastive learning to exploit clean CT images and metal-affected images as positive and negative samples, respectively. Experimental results show that our TriDoNet can generate superior artifact-reduced CT images. ",

In future smart factories, it is envisioned that factory workers will use VR devices via VR application data with high quality resolution, while transmitting over THz links and RIS devices, enabled by the Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) capabilities. Since indoor RIS placement is static, whereas VR users move and send multiple VR data download requests simultaneously, there is a challenge of proper network load balancing, which if unaddressed can result in poor resource utilization and low throughput. To address this challenge, we propose a parallel downlink data distribution system and develop multi-criteria optimization solutions that can improve throughput, while transmitting each downlink data flow over a set of possible paths between source and destination devices. The results show that the proposed system can enhance the performance in terms of throughput benefit, as compared to the system using one serial download link distribution. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-antenna (MIMO) processing is a promising solution to the problem of jammer mitigation. Existing methods mitigate the jammer based on an estimate of its subspace (or receive statistics) acquired through a dedicated training phase. This strategy has two main drawbacks: (i) it reduces the communication rate since no data can be transmitted during the training phase and (ii) it can be evaded by smart or multi-antenna jammers that are quiet during the training phase or that dynamically change their subspace through time-varying beamforming. To address these drawbacks, we propose Joint jammer Mitigation and data Detection (JMD), a novel paradigm for MIMO jammer mitigation. The core idea is to estimate and remove the jammer interference subspace jointly with detecting the transmit data over multiple time slots. Doing so removes the need for a dedicated and rate-reducing training period while mitigating smart and dynamic multi-antenna jammers. We instantiate our paradigm with SANDMAN, a simple and practical algorithm for multi-user MIMO uplink JMD. Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of JMD, and of SANDMAN in particular, for jammer mitigation. ",

The proposed solution relies on a novel agent-object pose graph modeling to enhance pose consistency among collaborating agents. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-scale data fusion strategy to aggregate intermediate features at multiple spatial resolutions. Comparing with previous works, which require ground-truth pose for training supervision, our proposed CoAlign is more practical since it doesn't require any ground-truth pose supervision in the training and makes no specific assumptions on pose errors. Extensive evaluation of the proposed method is carried out on multiple datasets, certifying that CoAlign significantly reduce relative localization error and achieving the state of art detection performance when pose errors exist.

Delving into the optimization process of adversarial training, we find that robust connectivity patterns emerge in the early training phase (typically $0.15\\sim0.3$ epochs), far before parameters converge. Inspired by this finding, we dig out robust early-bird tickets (i.e., subnetworks) to develop an efficient adversarial training method: (1) searching for robust tickets with structured sparsity in the early stage; (2) fine-tuning robust tickets in the remaining time. To extract the robust tickets as early as possible, we design a ticket convergence metric to automatically terminate the searching process. Experiments show that the proposed efficient adversarial training method can achieve up to $7\\times \\sim 13 \\times$ training speedups while maintaining comparable or even better robustness compared to the most competitive state-of-the-art adversarial training methods.

However, these deep learning frameworks based on point estimation suffer from low generalization and inability to quantify the classification results uncertainty. On the other hand, simply applying the Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) based on distribution estimation to classify the HSI is unable to achieve high classification accuracy due to the large amount of parameters. In this paper, we design a Bayesian layer with Bayesian idea as an insertion layer into point estimation based neural networks, and propose a Bayesian Layer Graph Convolutional Network (BLGCN) model by combining graph convolution operations, which can effectively extract graph information and estimate the uncertainty of classification results. Moreover, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is built to solve the sample imbalance problem of HSI dataset. Finally, we design a dynamic control training strategy based on the confidence interval of the classification results, which will terminate the training early when the confidence interval reaches the preseted threshold.

    "abstract": "When taking photos under an environment with insufficient light, the exposure time and the sensor gain usually require to be carefully chosen to obtain images with satisfying visual quality. For example, the images with high ISO usually have inescapable noise, while the long-exposure ones may be blurry due to camera shake or object motion. Existing solutions generally suggest to seek a balance between noise and blur, and learn denoising or deblurring models under either full- or self-supervision. However, the real-world training pairs are difficult to collect, and the self-supervised methods merely rely on blurry or noisy images are limited in performance. In this work, we tackle this problem by jointly leveraging the short-exposure noisy image and the long-exposure blurry image for better image restoration. Such setting is practically feasible due to that short-exposure and long-exposure images can be either acquired by two individual cameras or synthesized by a long burst of images. Moreover, the short-exposure images are hardly blurry, and the long-exposure ones have negligible noise. Their complementarity makes it feasible to learn restoration model in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, the noisy images can be used as the supervision information for deblurring, while the sharp areas in the blurry images can be utilized as the auxiliary supervision information for self-supervised denoising. By learning in a collaborative manner, the deblurring and denoising tasks in our method can benefit each other. Experiments on synthetic and real-world images show the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method. Codes are available at https://github.com/cszhilu1998/SelfIR. ",

Furthermore, we find that using both Off-TE and On-TE results in better convergence in the pre-training phase. With both effectiveness and efficiency, we think that doing multi-task learning on self-supervised speech models from our perspective is a promising trend. ",

    "abstract": "We consider estimation models of the form $Y=X^*+N$, where $X^*$ is some $m$-dimensional signal we wish to recover, and $N$ is symmetrically distributed noise that may be unbounded in all but a small $\\alpha$ fraction of the entries. We introduce a family of algorithms that under mild assumptions recover the signal $X^*$ in all estimation problems for which there exists a sum-of-squares algorithm that succeeds in recovering the signal $X^*$ when the noise $N$ is Gaussian. This essentially shows that it is enough to design a sum-of-squares algorithm for an estimation problem with Gaussian noise in order to get the algorithm that works with the symmetric noise model. Our framework extends far beyond previous results on symmetric noise models and is even robust to adversarial perturbations. As concrete examples, we investigate two problems for which no efficient algorithms were known to work for heavy-tailed noise: tensor PCA and sparse PCA. For the former, our algorithm recovers the principal component in polynomial time when the signal-to-noise ratio is at least $\\tilde{O}(n^{p/4}/\\alpha)$, that matches (up to logarithmic factors) current best known algorithmic guarantees for Gaussian noise. For the latter, our algorithm runs in quasipolynomial time and matches the state-of-the-art guarantees for quasipolynomial time algorithms in the case of Gaussian noise. Using a reduction from the planted clique problem, we provide evidence that the quasipolynomial time is likely to be necessary for sparse PCA with symmetric noise. In our proofs we use bounds on the covering numbers of sets of pseudo-expectations, which we obtain by certifying in sum-of-squares upper bounds on the Gaussian complexities of sets of solutions. This approach for bounding the covering numbers of sets of pseudo-expectations may be interesting in its own right and may find other application in future works. ",

Typically, such algorithms require several (virtually, infinite) communication rounds between the subsystems to converge, which is a major drawback both computationally and from an energetic perspective (for wireless systems). Motivated by these challenges, we propose a suboptimal distributed MPC scheme in which the total communication burden is distributed also in time, by maintaining a running solution estimate for the large-scale OCP and updating it at each sampling time. We demonstrate that, under some regularity conditions, the resulting suboptimal MPC control law recovers the qualitative robust stability properties of optimal MPC, if the communication budget at each sampling time is large enough.

    "abstract": "To eliminate the requirement of fully-labeled data for supervised model training in traditional Federated Learning (FL), extensive attention has been paid to the application of Self-supervised Learning (SSL) approaches on FL to tackle the label scarcity problem. Previous works on Federated SSL generally fall into two categories: parameter-based model aggregation (i.e., FedAvg, applicable to homogeneous cases) or data-based feature sharing (i.e., knowledge distillation, applicable to heterogeneous cases) to achieve knowledge transfer among multiple unlabeled clients. Despite the progress, all of them inevitably rely on some assumptions, such as homogeneous models or the existence of an additional public dataset, which hinder the universality of the training frameworks for more general scenarios. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel and general method named Federated Self-supervised Learning with Feature-correlation based Aggregation (FedFoA) to tackle the above limitations in a communication-efficient and privacy-preserving manner. Our insight is to utilize feature correlation to align the feature mappings and calibrate the local model updates across clients during their local training process. More specifically, we design a factorization-based method to extract the cross-feature relation matrix from the local representations. Then, the relation matrix can be regarded as a carrier of semantic information to perform the aggregation phase. We prove that FedFoA is a model-agnostic training framework and can be easily compatible with state-of-the-art unsupervised FL methods. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin. ",

Due to their intrinsic architecture, conventional neural networks cannot be successfully trained and scoped when data is sparse; a scenario that is true in many scientific fields. Nonetheless, neural networks offer a strong foundation to digest physical-driven or knowledge-based constraints during training. Generally speaking, there are three distinct neural network frameworks to enforce underlying physics: (i) physics-guided neural networks (PgNN), (ii) physics-informed neural networks (PiNN) and (iii) physics-encoded neural networks (PeNN). These approaches offer unique advantages to accelerate the modeling of complex multiscale multi-physics phenomena. They also come with unique drawbacks and suffer from unresolved limitations (e.g., stability, convergence, and generalization) that call for further research. This study aims to present an in-depth review of the three neural network frameworks (i.e., PgNN, PiNN, and PeNN) used in scientific computing research. The state-of-the-art architectures and their applications are reviewed; limitations are discussed; and future research opportunities in terms of improving algorithms, considering causalities, expanding applications, and coupling scientific and deep learning solvers are presented.

However, an ongoing challenge is the generalization of presentation attack detection methods to unseen and new attack types. To this end, we propose a new T-shirt Face Presentation Attack (TFPA) database of 1,608 T-shirt attacks using 100 unique presentation attack instruments.

Further, we propose three new methods for detecting T-shirt attack images, one which relies on the statistical differences between depth maps of bona fide images and T-shirt attacks, an anomaly detection approach trained on features only extracted from bona fide RGB images, and a fusion approach which achieves competitive detection performance.

In this paper, we employ a novel approach to derive density and distribution functions of the envelope of the $\\alpha$-$\\eta$-$\\kappa$-$\\mu$ fading channel without an infinite series approximation. The derived statistical results are presented using a single Fox's H-function for tractable performance analysis and efficient numerical computations, especially for high-frequency mmWave and terahertz wireless transmissions. To gain insight into the distribution of channel envelope, we develop an asymptotic analysis using a more straightforward Gamma function converging to the exact within a reasonable range of channel parameters. To further substantiate the proposed analysis, we present the exact outage probability and average bit-error-rate (BER) performance of a wireless link subjected to the $\\alpha$-$\\eta$-$\\kappa$-$\\mu$ fading model using a single tri-variate Fox's H-function. We obtain the diversity order of the system by analyzing the outage probability at a high signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio.

    "abstract": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) has been intensively studied for years because of its potential applications in intelligent video systems. Existing unsupervised VAD methods tend to learn normality from training sets consisting of only normal videos and regard instances deviating from such normality as anomalies. However, they often consider only local or global normality. Some of them focus on learning local spatiotemporal representations from consecutive frames in video clips to enhance the representation for normal events. But powerful representation allows these methods to represent some anomalies and causes missed detections. In contrast, the other methods are devoted to memorizing global prototypical patterns of whole training videos to weaken the generalization for anomalies, which also restricts them to represent diverse normal patterns and causes false alarms. To this end, we propose a two-branch model, Local-Global Normality Network (LGN-Net), to learn local and global normality simultaneously. Specifically, one branch learns the evolution regularities of appearance and motion from consecutive frames as local normality utilizing a spatiotemporal prediction network, while the other branch memorizes prototype features of the whole videos as global normality by a memory module. LGN-Net achieves a balance of representing normal and abnormal instances by fusing local and global normality. The fused normality enables our model more generalized to various scenes compared to exploiting single normality. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our method.

Empirical results indicate that existing systems are severely challenged by these perturbations. E.g., Graph2Tree experienced a 53.83% absolute accuracy drop against the ``Extra'' perturbation on ASDiv-a, and BART experienced 13.80% accuracy drop against the ``Language'' perturbation on the numerical subset of DROP. As a counteracting approach, we also investigate the effectiveness of applying perturbations as data augmentation to relieve systems' lack of robust numerical capabilities.

This research demonstrates an RL compatible simplified edge network simulator with three components, user equipment(UE), Edge O-Cloud, and Regional O-Cloud. This simulator is later used to discover how to improve throughput for targeted network slice(s) by dynamically allocating unused bandwidth from other slices. Increasing the throughput for certain network slicing can also benefit the end users with a higher average data rate, peak rate, or shorter transmission time. The results show that the RL model can provide eMBB traffic with a high peak rate and shorter transmission time for URLLC compared to balanced and eMBB focus baselines. ",

In this work, we propose an epidemiological model that explores the viral transmission over the multi-layer contact network composed of the school layer and community layer with population heterogeneity on mask-wearing behavior. We derive analytical expressions for three key epidemiological quantities: the probability of emergence, the epidemic threshold, and the expected epidemic size. In particular, we show how the aforementioned quantities depend on the structure of the multi-layer contact network, viral transmission dynamics, and the distribution of the different types of masks within the population. Through extensive simulations, our analytical results show near-perfect agreement with the simulation results with a limited number of nodes. Utilizing the model, we study the impact of the opening/closure of the school layer on the viral transmission dynamics with various mask-wearing scenarios. Interestingly, we found that it's safe to open the school layer with the proper proportion of good-quality masks in the population. Moreover, we validate the theory of the trade-off between source-control and self-protection over a single layer by Tian et al on our multi-layer setting. We conclude that even on a multi-layer network, it's of great significance to treat the spreading process as two distinct phases in mind when considering mitigation strategies. Besides, we would like to remark that our model of spreading process over multi-layer networks with population heterogeneity can also be applied to various other domains, such as misinformation control.

In this paper, we propose to use fusion diagrams, a technique widely used in simulating SU($2$)-symmetric quantum many-body problems, to design new equivariant components for use in equivariant neural networks. This yields a diagrammatic approach to constructing new neural network architectures. We show that when applied to particles in a given local neighborhood, the resulting components, which we call fusion blocks, are universal approximators of any continuous equivariant function defined on the neighborhood. As a practical demonstration, we incorporate a fusion block into a pre-existing equivariant architecture (Cormorant) and show that it improves performance on benchmark molecular learning tasks. ",

Six classes of microalgae commonlyfound in the ocean (Bacillariophyta, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, Platymonas, Dunaliella salina, Chrysophyta, Symbiodiniaceae) are microscopically imaged in real-time. Images of Symbiodiniaceae in three physiological states known as normal, bleaching, and translating are also included. We annotated these images with bounding boxes using Labelme software and split them into the training and testing sets. The total number of images in the dataset is 937 and all the objects in these images were annotated. The total number of annotated objects is 4201. The training set contains 537 images and the testing set contains 430 images. Baselines of different object detection algorithms are trained, validated and tested on this dataset. This data set can be got accessed via tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/532036/information. ",

    "abstract": "Many standard graph classes are known to be characterized by means of layouts (a permutation of its vertices) excluding some patterns. Important such graph classes are among others: proper interval graphs, interval graphs, chordal graphs, permutation graphs, (co-)comparability graphs. For example, a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a proper interval graph if and only if $G$ has a layout $L$ such that for every triple of vertices such that $x\\prec_L y\\prec_L z$, if $xz\\in E$, then $xy\\in E$ and $yz\\in E$. Such a triple $x$, $y$, $z$ is called an indifference triple and layouts excluding indifference triples are known as indifference layouts. In this paper, we investigate the concept of tree-layouts. A tree-layout $T_G=(T,r,\\rho_G)$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a tree $T$ rooted at some node $r$ and equipped with a one-to-one mapping $\\rho_G$ between $V$ and the nodes of $T$ such that for every edge $xy\\in E$, either $x$ is an ancestor of $y$ or $y$ is an ancestor of $x$. Clearly, layouts are tree-layouts. Excluding a pattern in a tree-layout is defined similarly as excluding a pattern in a layout, but now using the ancestor relation. Unexplored graph classes can be defined by means of tree-layouts excluding some patterns. As a proof of concept, we show that excluding non-indifference triples in tree-layouts yields a natural notion of proper chordal graphs. We characterize proper chordal graphs and position them in the hierarchy of known subclasses of chordal graphs. We also provide a canonical representation of proper chordal graphs that encodes all the indifference tree-layouts rooted at some vertex. Based on this result, we first design a polynomial time recognition algorithm for proper chordal graphs. We then show that the problem of testing isomorphism between two proper chordal graphs is in P, whereas this problem is known to be GI-complete on chordal graphs. ",

Furthermore, such approaches rely on the magnetic dipole model for the optimization function, leading to inaccurate results anytime a non-spherical magnet gets close to a sensor in the array. We propose to overcome these limitations by using neural networks to infer the marker's position and orientation. Our method can obtain the magnet's five degrees of freedom (5 DoF) in a single inference step without relying on an initial estimation. As a counterpart, the supervised training phase is data intensive. We solve this by generating synthetic, yet realistic, data via Finite Element Methods simulations. A fast and accurate inference largely compensates for the offline training preparation. We evaluate our system using different cylindrical magnets, tracked with a square array of 16 sensors. We use a portable, neural networks-oriented single-board computer for the sensors' reading and the position inference, making our setup very compact. We compared our tracking outputs with vision-based ground truth data. Our prototype implementation tracks $5$ DoF with an averaged positional error of 4mm and orientation error of 8deg within a 0.2x0.2x0.15m working volume. ",

In recent years, a number of empirically grounded, survey-based studies have been conducted to investigate secure development and usage of mHealth apps. However, such studies rely on self reported behaviors documented via interviews or survey questions that lack a practical, i.e. action based approach to monitor and synthesise users actions and behaviors in security critical scenarios. We conducted an empirical study, engaging participants with attack simulation scenarios and analyse their actions, for investigating the security awareness of mHealth app users via action-based research. We simulated some common security attack scenarios in mHealth context and engaged a total of 105 app users to monitor their actions and analyse their behavior. We analysed users data with statistical analysis including reliability and correlations tests, descriptive analysis, and qualitative data analysis. Our results indicate that whilst the minority of our participants perceived access permissions positively, the majority had negative views by indicating that such an app could violate or cost them to lose privacy. Users provide their consent, granting permissions, without a careful review of privacy policies that leads to undesired or malicious access to health critical data. The results also indicated that 73.3% of our participants had denied at least one access permission, and 36% of our participants preferred no authentication method. The study complements existing research on secure usage of mHealth apps, simulates security threats to monitor users actions, and provides empirically grounded guidelines for secure development and usage of mobile health systems.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to enhance the generalization of the learned model to other domains. The domain-invariant knowledge is transferred from the model trained on labeled source domain, e.g., video game, to unlabeled target domains, e.g., real-world scenarios, saving annotation expenses. Existing UDA methods for semantic segmentation usually focus on minimizing the inter-domain discrepancy of various levels, e.g., pixels, features, and predictions, for extracting domain-invariant knowledge. However, the primary intra-domain knowledge, such as context correlation inside an image, remains underexplored. In an attempt to fill this gap, we propose a unified pixel- and patch-wise self-supervised learning framework, called PiPa, for domain adaptive semantic segmentation that facilitates intra-image pixel-wise correlations and patch-wise semantic consistency against different contexts. The proposed framework exploits the inherent structures of intra-domain images, which: (1) explicitly encourages learning the discriminative pixel-wise features with intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, and (2) motivates the robust feature learning of the identical patch against different contexts or fluctuations. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, which obtains competitive accuracy on the two widely-used UDA benchmarks, i.e., 75.6 mIoU on GTA to Cityscapes and 68.2 mIoU on Synthia to Cityscapes. Moreover, our method is compatible with other UDA approaches to further improve the performance without introducing extra parameters. ",

EVA is a vanilla ViT pre-trained to reconstruct the masked out image-text aligned vision features conditioned on visible image patches. Via this pretext task, we can efficiently scale up EVA to one billion parameters, and sets new records on a broad range of representative vision downstream tasks, such as image recognition, video action recognition, object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation without heavy supervised training. Moreover, we observe quantitative changes in scaling EVA result in qualitative changes in transfer learning performance that are not present in other models. For instance, EVA takes a great leap in the challenging large vocabulary instance segmentation task: our model achieves almost the same state-of-the-art performance on LVISv1.0 dataset with over a thousand categories and COCO dataset with only eighty categories. Beyond a pure vision encoder, EVA can also serve as a vision-centric, multi-modal pivot to connect images and text. We find initializing the vision tower of a giant CLIP from EVA can greatly stabilize the training and outperform the training from scratch counterpart with much fewer samples and less compute, providing a new direction for scaling up and accelerating the costly training of multi-modal foundation models.

However, shorter proteins (known as peptides) take on distinct structures and functions compared to their longer counterparts. Unfortunately, there are not as many naturally occurring peptides available to be sequenced and therefore less peptide-specific data to train with. In this paper, we propose a new peptide data augmentation scheme, where we train peptide language models on artificially constructed peptides that are small contiguous subsets of longer, wild-type proteins; we refer to the training peptides as \"chopped proteins\". We evaluate the representation potential of models trained with chopped proteins versus natural peptides and find that training language models with chopped proteins results in more generalized embeddings for short protein sequences. These peptide-specific models also retain information about the original protein they were derived from better than language models trained on full-length proteins. We compare masked language model training objectives to three novel peptide-specific training objectives: next-peptide prediction, contrastive peptide selection and evolution-weighted MLM. We demonstrate improved zero-shot learning performance for a deep mutational scan peptides benchmark. ",

To mitigate this issue, we use a customized edit-distance algorithm to estimate the token-level SCD false accept (FA) and false reject (FR) rates during training and optimize model parameters to minimize a weighted combination of the FA and FR, focusing the model on accurately predicting speaker changes. We also propose a set of evaluation metrics that align better with commercial use cases.

In practice, only a few low-resolution volumes are acquired. Thus, optimization-based image-reconstruction methods require strong regularization using hand-crafted regularizers (e.g., TV). Yet, due to in utero fetal motion and the rapidly changing fetal brain anatomy, the acquisition of the high-resolution images that are required to train supervised learning methods is difficult. In this paper, we sidestep this difficulty by providing a proof of concept of a self-supervised single-volume superresolution framework for T2-weighted FBMRI (SAIR). We validate SAIR quantitatively in a motion-free simulated environment. Our results for different noise levels and resolution ratios suggest that SAIR is comparable to multiple-volume superresolution reconstruction methods. We also evaluate SAIR qualitatively on clinical FBMRI data. The results suggest SAIR could be incorporated into current reconstruction pipelines. ",

To address these issues, we devise a cascaded modular system leveraging self-supervised discrete speech units as language representation. These discrete units provide duration information essential for rhythm modeling. Our system first extracts utterance-level prosody and speaker representations from the raw waveform. Given the prosody representation, a prosody predictor estimates pitch, energy, and duration for each discrete unit in the utterance. A synthesizer further reconstructs speech based on the predicted prosody, speaker representation, and discrete units. Experiments show that our system outperforms previous approaches in naturalness, intelligibility, speaker transferability, and prosody transferability. Code and samples are publicly available. ",

In this paper, we explore the relationships among all phylogenetic trees that are embedded in a given phylogenetic network. First, we investigate some combinatorial properties of the collection P of all rooted binary phylogenetic trees that are embedded in a rooted binary phylogenetic network N. To this end, we associated a particular graph G, which we call rSPR graph, with the elements in P and show that, if |P|=2^k, where k is the number of vertices with in-degree two in N, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle. Second, by exploiting rSPR graphs and properties of hypercubes, we turn to the well-studied class of rooted binary level-1 networks and give necessary and sufficient conditions for when a set of rooted binary phylogenetic trees can be embedded in a level-1 network without inferring any additional trees. Lastly, we show how these conditions translate into a polynomial-time algorithm to reconstruct such a network if it exists. ",

    "abstract": "End-to-end diarization presents an attractive alternative to standard cascaded diarization systems because a single system can handle all aspects of the task at once. Many flavors of end-to-end models have been proposed but all of them require (so far non-existing) large amounts of annotated data for training. The compromise solution consists in generating synthetic data and the recently proposed simulated conversations (SC) have shown remarkable improvements over the original simulated mixtures (SM). In this work, we create SC with multiple speakers per conversation and show that they allow for substantially better performance than SM, also reducing the dependence on a fine-tuning stage. We also create SC with wide-band public audio sources and present an analysis on several evaluation sets. Together with this publication, we release the recipes for generating such data and models trained on public sets as well as the implementation to efficiently handle multiple speakers per conversation and an auxiliary voice activity detection loss.

    "abstract": "The first step in drug discovery is finding drug molecule moieties with medicinal activity against specific targets. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the interaction between drug-target proteins and small chemical molecules. However, traditional experimental methods for discovering potential small drug molecules are labor-intensive and time-consuming. There is currently a lot of interest in building computational models to screen small drug molecules using drug molecule-related databases. In this paper, we propose a method for predicting drug-target binding affinity using deep learning models. This method uses a modified GRU and GNN to extract features from the drug-target protein sequences and the drug molecule map, respectively, to obtain their feature vectors. The combined vectors are used as vector representations of drug-target molecule pairs and then fed into a fully connected network to predict drug-target binding affinity. This proposed model demonstrates its accuracy and effectiveness in predicting drug-target binding affinity on the DAVIS and KIBA datasets. ",

They combine the best features of classic statistical speech synthesis and modern neural TTS, requiring less data and fewer training updates, and are less prone to gibberish output caused by neural attention failures. In this paper, we combine neural HMM TTS with normalising flows for describing the highly non-Gaussian distribution of speech acoustics. The result is a powerful, fully probabilistic model of durations and acoustics that can be trained using exact maximum likelihood. Compared to dominant flow-based acoustic models, our approach integrates autoregression for improved modelling of long-range dependences such as utterance-level prosody. Experiments show that a system based on our proposal gives more accurate pronunciations and better subjective speech quality than comparable methods, whilst retaining the original advantages of neural HMMs. Audio examples and code are available at https://shivammehta25.github.io/OverFlow/ ",

This paper develops a self-regularized graph neural network (SR-GNN) solution that improves the architecture stability by regularizing the filter frequency responses in the graph spectral domain. The SR-GNN considers not only the graph signal as input but also the eigenvectors of the underlying graph, where the signal is processed to generate task-relevant features and the eigenvectors to characterize the frequency responses at each layer. We train the SR-GNN by minimizing the cost function and regularizing the maximal frequency response close to one. The former improves the architecture performance, while the latter tightens the perturbation stability and alleviates the information loss through multi-layer propagation. We further show the SR-GNN preserves the permutation equivariance, which allows to explore the internal symmetries of graph signals and to exhibit transference on similar graph structures. Numerical results with source localization and movie recommendation corroborate our findings and show the SR-GNN yields a comparable performance with the vanilla GNN on the unperturbed graph but improves substantially the stability.

This paper provides a novel multi-objective inverse reinforcement learning approach which allows for both detection of such Pareto optimal ('coordinating') behavior and subsequent reconstruction of each radar's utility function, given a finite dataset of radar network emissions. The method for accomplishing this is derived from the micro-economic setting of Revealed Preferences, and also applies to more general problems of inverse detection and learning of multi-objective optimizing systems.

Learning-based detection does not need to estimate channels, which overcomes a key drawback in one-bit quantized systems. During training, learning-based detection suffers at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) because observations will be biased to +1 or -1 which leads to many zero-valued empirical likelihood functions. At low SNR, observations vary frequently in value but the high noise power makes capturing the effect of the channel difficult. To address these drawbacks, we propose an adaptive dithering-and-learning method. During training, received values are mixed with dithering noise whose statistics are known to the base station, and the dithering noise power is updated for each antenna element depending on the observed pattern of the output. We then use the refined probabilities in the one-bit maximum likelihood detection rule. Simulation results validate the detection performance of the proposed method vs. our previous method using fixed dithering noise power as well as zero-forcing and optimal ML detection both of which assume perfect channel knowledge.

Most previous works explore temporal redundancy by detecting and compressing a motion map to warp the reference frame towards the target frame. Yet, it failed to adequately take advantage of the historical priors in the sequential reference frames. In this paper, we propose an Advanced Learned Video Compression (ALVC) approach with the in-loop frame prediction module, which is able to effectively predict the target frame from the previously compressed frames, \\textit{without consuming any bit-rate}. The predicted frame can serve as a better reference than the previously compressed frame, and therefore it benefits the compression performance. The proposed in-loop prediction module is a part of the end-to-end video compression and is jointly optimized in the whole framework. We propose the recurrent and the bi-directional in-loop prediction modules for compressing P-frames and B-frames, respectively. The experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of our ALVC approach in learned video compression.

It seeks to understand the advantages of employing quantum devices in developing new learning algorithms as well as improving the existing ones. A set of architectures that are heavily explored in quantum machine learning are quantum neural networks. In this review, we consider ideas from distributed deep learning as they apply to quantum neural networks. We find that the distribution of quantum datasets shares more similarities with its classical counterpart than does the distribution of quantum models, though the unique aspects of quantum data introduces new vulnerabilities to both approaches.

    "abstract": "Cochlear implantation is currently the most effective treatment for patients with severe deafness, but mastering cochlear implantation is extremely challenging because the temporal bone has extremely complex and small three-dimensional anatomical structures, and it is important to avoid damaging the corresponding structures when performing surgery. The spatial location of the relevant anatomical tissues within the target area needs to be determined using CT prior to the procedure. Considering that the target structures are too small and complex, the time required for manual segmentation is too long, and it is extremely challenging to segment the temporal bone and its nearby anatomical structures quickly and accurately. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a deep learning-based algorithm, a 3D network model for automatic segmentation of multi-structural targets in temporal bone CT that can automatically segment the cochlea, facial nerve, auditory tubercle, vestibule and semicircular canal. The algorithm combines CNN and Transformer for feature extraction and takes advantage of spatial attention and channel attention mechanisms to further improve the segmentation effect, the experimental results comparing with the results of various existing segmentation algorithms show that the dice similarity scores, Jaccard coefficients of all targets anatomical structures are significantly higher while HD95 and ASSD scores are lower, effectively proving that our method outperforms other advanced methods.

The computation of the trade currency preference is based on the world trade network built from the 2010-2020 UN Comtrade data. The preference of a country to trade in US dollar or Chinese yuan is determined by two multiplicative factors: the relative weight of trade volume exchanged by the country with its direct trade partners, and the relative weight of its trade partners in the global international trade. The performed analysis, based on Ising spin interactions on the world trade network, shows that, from 2010 to present, a transition took place, and the majority of the world countries would have now a preference to trade in Chinese yuan if one only consider the world trade network structure.

ICA can identify patterns that can discriminate between healthy controls (HC) and patients with various mental disorders such as schizophrenia (Sz). Temporal functional network connectivity (tFNC) obtained from ICA can effectively explain the interactions between brain networks. On the other hand, dictionary learning (DL) enables the discovery of hidden information in data using learnable basis signals through the use of sparsity. In this paper, we present a new method that leverages ICA and DL for the identification of directly interpretable patterns to discriminate between the HC and Sz groups. We use multi-subject resting-state fMRI data from $358$ subjects and form subject-specific tFNC feature vectors from ICA results. Then, we learn sparse representations of the tFNCs and introduce a new set of sparse features as well as new interpretable patterns from the learned atoms. Our experimental results show that the new representation not only leads to effective classification between HC and Sz groups using sparse features, but can also identify new interpretable patterns from the learned atoms that can help understand the complexities of mental diseases such as schizophrenia.

    "title": "Age Prediction Performance Varies Across Deep, Superficial, and  Cerebellar White Matter Connections",
    "abstract": "The brain's white matter (WM) undergoes developmental and degenerative processes during the human lifespan. To investigate the relationship between WM anatomical regions and age, we study diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractography that is finely parcellated into fiber clusters in the deep, superficial, and cerebellar WM. We propose a deep-learning-based age prediction model that leverages large convolutional kernels and inverted bottlenecks. We improve performance using novel discrete multi-faceted mix data augmentation and a novel prior-knowledge-based loss function that encourages age predictions in the expected range. We study a dataset of 965 healthy young adults (22-37 years) derived from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a mean absolute error of 2.59 years and outperforms compared methods. We find that the deep WM is the most informative for age prediction in this cohort, while the superficial WM is the least informative. Overall, the most predictive WM tracts are the thalamo-frontal tract from the deep WM and the intracerebellar input and Purkinje tract from the cerebellar WM. ",

    "title": "Efficient Integration of Multi-Order Dynamics and Internal Dynamics in  Stock Movement Prediction",
    "abstract": "Advances in deep neural network (DNN) architectures have enabled new prediction techniques for stock market data. Unlike other multivariate time-series data, stock markets show two unique characteristics: (i) \\emph{multi-order dynamics}, as stock prices are affected by strong non-pairwise correlations (e.g., within the same industry); and (ii) \\emph{internal dynamics}, as each individual stock shows some particular behaviour. Recent DNN-based methods capture multi-order dynamics using hypergraphs, but rely on the Fourier basis in the convolution, which is both inefficient and ineffective. In addition, they largely ignore internal dynamics by adopting the same model for each stock, which implies a severe information loss. In this paper, we propose a framework for stock movement prediction to overcome the above issues. Specifically, the framework includes temporal generative filters that implement a memory-based mechanism onto an LSTM network in an attempt to learn individual patterns per stock. Moreover, we employ hypergraph attentions to capture the non-pairwise correlations. Here, using the wavelet basis instead of the Fourier basis, enables us to simplify the message passing and focus on the localized convolution. Experiments with US market data over six years show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of profit and stability.

    "title": "Accounting for Temporal Variability in Functional Magnetic Resonance  Imaging Improves Prediction of Intelligence",
    "abstract": "Neuroimaging-based prediction methods for intelligence and cognitive abilities have seen a rapid development, while prediction based on functional connectivity (FC) has shown great promise. The overwhelming majority of literature has focused on static FC with extremely limited results available on dynamic FC or region level fMRI time series. Unlike static FC, the latter features include the temporal variability in the fMRI data. In this project, we propose a novel bi-LSTM approach that incorporates an $L_0$ regularization for feature selection. The proposed pipeline is applied to prediction based on region level fMRI time series as well as dynamic FC and implemented via an efficient algorithm. We undertake a detailed comparison of prediction performance for different intelligence measures based on fMRI features acquired from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Our analysis illustrates that static FC consistently has inferior performance compared to region level fMRI time series or dynamic FC for unimodal rest and task fMRI experiments, as well as in almost all cases for multi-task analysis. The proposed pipeline based on region level time-series identifies several important brain regions that drive fluctuations in intelligence measures. Strong test-retest reliability of the selected features is reported, pointing to reproducible findings. Given the large sample size from ABCD study, our results provide conclusive evidence that superior intelligence prediction can be achieved by considering temporal variations in the fMRI data, either at the region level, or based on dynamic FC, which is one of the first such findings in literature. These results are particularly noteworthy, given the low dimensionality of the region level time series, easier interpretability, and extremely quick computation times, compared to network-based analysis.

    "abstract": "With the advances in deep learning, speech enhancement systems benefited from large neural network architectures and achieved state-of-the-art quality. However, speaker-agnostic methods are not always desirable, both in terms of quality and their complexity, when they are to be used in a resource-constrained environment. One promising way is personalized speech enhancement (PSE), which is a smaller and easier speech enhancement problem for small models to solve, because it focuses on a particular test-time user. To achieve the personalization goal, while dealing with the typical lack of personal data, we investigate the effect of data augmentation based on neural speech synthesis (NSS). In the proposed method, we show that the quality of the NSS system's synthetic data matters, and if they are good enough the augmented dataset can be used to improve the PSE system that outperforms the speaker-agnostic baseline. The proposed PSE systems show significant complexity reduction while preserving the enhancement quality. ",

    "abstract": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) drones have the potential to enable several futuristic applications such as coverage extension, enhanced security monitoring, and disaster management. However, these drones need to deploy large antenna arrays and use narrow directive beams to maintain a sufficient link budget. The large beam training overhead associated with these arrays makes adjusting these narrow beams challenging for highly-mobile drones. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a vision-aided machine learning-based approach that leverages visual data collected from cameras installed on the drones to enable fast and accurate beam prediction. Further, to facilitate the evaluation of the proposed solution, we build a synthetic drone communication dataset consisting of co-existing wireless and visual data. The proposed vision-aided solution achieves a top-$1$ beam prediction accuracy of $\\approx 91\\%$ and close to $100\\%$ top-$3$ accuracy. These results highlight the efficacy of the proposed solution towards enabling highly mobile mmWave/THz drone communication. ",

    "abstract": "Thermographic testing, as a non-destructive testing method, is a non-contact imaging technique for examining specimens by characterizing their thermal conduction behavior. One of the main limitations of thermography is the inherent limit to the resolution of the internal structures of any specimen due to the diffusive nature of heat conduction. Overcoming this limit is the goal of thermographic super resolution methods. In this work, we present a method using two-dimensional pixel pattern based active photothermal laser heating in conjunction with subsequent numerical reconstruction to achieve a high-resolution reconstruction of internal defect structures. Furthermore, a forward solution to the underlying inverse problem is proposed along with an appropriate heuristic to find the regularization parameters necessary for the inversion in a laboratory setting. This allows the generation of synthetic measurement data, opening the door for the application of machine learning based methods for future improvements towards full automation of the method. The proposed experimental approach is validated using the latest laser coupled DLP projector technology as a heat source. Finally, the proposed method is shown to outperform several established conventional thermographic testing techniques while improving the required measurement times by a factor of 8 compared to currently available photothermal super resolution techniques.
