    "abstract": "With the rapid development of deep learning models and hardware support for dense computing, the deep learning (DL) workload characteristics changed significantly from a few hot spots on compute-intensive operations to a broad range of operations scattered across the models. Accelerating a few compute-intensive operations using the expert-tuned implementation of primitives does not fully exploit the performance potential of AI hardware. Various efforts are made to compile a full deep neural network (DNN) graph. One of the biggest challenges is to achieve end-to-end compilation by generating expert-level performance code for the dense compute-intensive operations and applying compilation optimization at the scope of DNN computation graph across multiple compute-intensive operations. We present oneDNN Graph Compiler, a tensor compiler that employs a hybrid approach of using techniques from both compiler optimization and expert-tuned kernels for high-performance code generation of the deep neural network graph. oneDNN Graph Compiler addresses unique optimization challenges in the deep learning domain, such as low-precision computation, aggressive fusion, optimization for static tensor shapes and memory layout, constant weight optimization, and memory buffer reuse. Experimental results demonstrate up to 2x performance gains over primitives-based optimization for performance-critical DNN computation graph patterns on Intel Xeon Scalable Processors. ",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of synthesizing proactive defense systems in which the defender can allocate deceptive targets and modify the cost of actions for the attacker who aims to compromise security assets in this system. We model the interaction of the attacker and the system using a formal security model -- a probabilistic attack graph. By allocating fake targets/decoys, the defender aims to distract the attacker from compromising true targets. By increasing the cost of some attack actions, the defender aims to discourage the attacker from committing to certain policies and thereby improve the defense. To optimize the defense given limited decoy resources and operational constraints, we formulate the synthesis problem as a bi-level optimization problem, while the defender designs the system, in anticipation of the attacker's best response given that the attacker has disinformation about the system due to the use of deception. Though the general formulation with bi-level optimization is NP-hard, we show that under certain assumptions, the problem can be transformed into a constrained optimization problem. We proposed an algorithm to approximately solve this constrained optimization problem using a novel incentive-design method for projected gradient ascent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using extensive numerical experiments. ",

    "abstract": "In the computer vision community, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), first proposed in the 1980's, have become the standard visual classification model. Recently, as alternatives to CNNs, Capsule Networks (CapsNets) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have been proposed. CapsNets, which were inspired by the information processing of the human brain, are considered to have more inductive bias than CNNs, whereas ViTs are considered to have less inductive bias than CNNs. All three classification models have received great attention since they can serve as backbones for various downstream tasks. However, these models are far from being perfect. As pointed out by the community, there are two weaknesses in standard Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). One of the limitations of DNNs is the lack of explainability. Even though they can achieve or surpass human expert performance in the image classification task, the DNN-based decisions are difficult to understand. In many real-world applications, however, individual decisions need to be explained. The other limitation of DNNs is adversarial vulnerability. Concretely, the small and imperceptible perturbations of inputs can mislead DNNs. The vulnerability of deep neural networks poses challenges to current visual classification models. The potential threats thereof can lead to unacceptable consequences. Besides, studying model adversarial vulnerability can lead to a better understanding of the underlying models. Our research aims to address the two limitations of DNNs. Specifically, we focus on deep visual classification models, especially the core building parts of each classification model, e.g. dynamic routing in CapsNets and self-attention module in ViTs. ",

Previous approaches found that egocentric models cannot be trained effectively from scratch and that exocentric representations transfer well to first-person videos. In this paper we revisit these two observations. Motivated by the large content and appearance gap separating the two domains, we propose a strategy that enables effective training of egocentric models without exocentric pretraining. Our Ego-Only pipeline is simple. It trains the video representation with a masked autoencoder finetuned for temporal segmentation. The learned features are then fed to an off-the-shelf temporal action localization method to detect actions. We evaluate our approach on two established egocentric video datasets: Ego4D and EPIC-Kitchens-100. On Ego4D, our Ego-Only is on-par with exocentric pretraining methods that use an order of magnitude more labels. On EPIC-Kitchens-100, our Ego-Only even outperforms exocentric pretraining (by 2.1% on verbs and by 1.8% on nouns), setting a new state-of-the-art. ",

    "abstract": "Recent years, graph contrastive learning (GCL), which aims to learn representations from unlabeled graphs, has made great progress. However, the existing GCL methods mostly adopt human-designed graph augmentations, which are sensitive to various graph datasets. In addition, the contrastive losses originally developed in computer vision have been directly applied to graph data, where the neighboring nodes are regarded as negatives and consequently pushed far apart from the anchor. However, this is contradictory with the homophily assumption of networks that connected nodes often belong to the same class and should be close to each other. In this work, we propose an end-to-end automatic GCL method, named NCLA to apply neighbor contrastive learning on learnable graph augmentation. Several graph augmented views with adaptive topology are automatically learned by the multi-head graph attention mechanism, which can be compatible with various graph datasets without prior domain knowledge. In addition, a neighbor contrastive loss is devised to allow multiple positives per anchor by taking network topology as the supervised signals. Both augmentations and embeddings are learned end-to-end in the proposed NCLA. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that NCLA yields the state-of-the-art node classification performance on self-supervised GCL and even exceeds the supervised ones, when the labels are extremely limited.

Due to predicting the complexity of each pixel with the ICNNP during the embedding process, the proposed method can achieve superior performance than the CNN predictor-based method. Specifically, an input image does be first split into two different sub-images, i.e., the \"Dot\" image and the \"Cross\" image. Meanwhile, each sub-image is applied to predict another one. Then, the prediction errors of pixels are sorted with the predicted pixel complexities. In light of this, some sorted prediction errors with less complexity are selected to be efficiently used for low-distortion data embedding with a traditional histogram shift scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better embedding performance than that of the CNN predictor with the same histogram shifting strategy. ",

The availability of large scale hand-labeled datasets and sufficient computing resources made it possible to train powerful deep neural networks, reaching very low Word Error Rate (WER) on academic benchmarks. However, despite impressive performance on clean audio samples, a drop of performance is often observed on noisy speech. In this work, we propose to improve the noise robustness of the recently proposed Efficient Conformer Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based architecture by processing both audio and visual modalities. We improve previous lip reading methods using an Efficient Conformer back-end on top of a ResNet-18 visual front-end and by adding intermediate CTC losses between blocks. We condition intermediate block features on early predictions using Inter CTC residual modules to relax the conditional independence assumption of CTC-based models. We also replace the Efficient Conformer grouped attention by a more efficient and simpler attention mechanism that we call patch attention. We experiment with publicly available Lip Reading Sentences 2 (LRS2) and Lip Reading Sentences 3 (LRS3) datasets. Our experiments show that using audio and visual modalities allows to better recognize speech in the presence of environmental noise and significantly accelerate training, reaching lower WER with 4 times less training steps. Our Audio-Visual Efficient Conformer (AVEC) model achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching WER of 2.3% and 1.8% on LRS2 and LRS3 test sets.

To this end, we develop a stochastic multi-objective optimization framework which minimizes the investment and the operation costs of the CES provider, and the social costs of the customers (i.e. cost of customers for trading energy with the grid and the CES). The uncertainty of SPV generation and real power consumption are modelled to follow the beta and normal distributions, respectively. Then, the roulette wheel mechanism (RWM) is exploited to formulate a scenario-based stochastic program. The initial scenarios obtained from the RWM, are then reduced by using the K-Means clustering algorithm, to keep the problem tractability. A case study highlights our model provides 10-21% more cumulative economic benefits for the customers and the CES provider, compared with the models that optimize only the CES scheduling. Also, the simulation results for different energy price schemes of the CES provider reflect, the customers change their power exchange with the CES and the grid significantly, to minimize their social costs.

On online social platforms, a few individuals, commonly referred to as \\textit{influencers}, produce the majority of content consumed by users. However, classic opinion models do not capture this communication asymmetry in OSNs. We develop an opinion model inspired by observations on leading social media platforms and tailored to the peculiarities of online interactions. Our work has two main objectives: first, to describe the inherent communication asymmetry in OSNs, where a tiny group of \\textit{influencers} hegemonizes the landscape of social debate, and second, to model the personalization of content by the social media platform. We derive a Fokker-Planck equation for the temporal evolution of users' opinion distribution and analytically characterize the stationary system behavior. Analytical results, confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations, show how content personalization tends to radicalize user opinion and favor structurally advantaged influencers. These emerging behaviors suggest that algorithmic bias, inherently associated with platform filtering, can lead to undesirable outcomes. As an example application, we apply our model to Facebook during the Italian government crisis in the summer of 2019. Our work provides a flexible framework to assess the impact of algorithmic filtering on the opinion formation process and a fine-grained tool to study the complex interaction between influencers and social network users.

Even with image streams from cameras directly attached to an HMD, stitching together a convincing image of an entire face remains a challenging task because of extreme capture angles and strong lens distortions due to a wide field of view. Compared to the long line of research in VR, reconstruction of faces hidden beneath an HMD is a very recent topic of research. While the current state-of-the-art solutions demonstrate photo-realistic 3D reconstruction results, they require high-cost laboratory equipment and large computational costs. We present an approach that focuses on low-cost hardware and can be used on a commodity gaming computer with a single GPU. We leverage the benefits of an end-to-end pipeline by means of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our GAN produces a frontal-facing 2.5D point cloud based on a training dataset captured with an RGBD camera. In our approach, the training process is offline, while the reconstruction runs in real-time. Our results show adequate reconstruction quality within the 'learned' expressions.

This conflicts with user privacy and requires to consider user rights regarding the processing of personal data. We outline potential privacy challenges regarding different attacker models and propose improvements to balance privacy in RBA systems.

    "abstract": "Controllers for dynamical systems that operate in safety-critical settings must account for stochastic disturbances. Such disturbances are often modeled as process noise in a dynamical system, and common assumptions are that the underlying distributions are known and/or Gaussian. In practice, however, these assumptions may be unrealistic and can lead to poor approximations of the true noise distribution. We present a novel controller synthesis method that does not rely on any explicit representation of the noise distributions. In particular, we address the problem of computing a controller that provides probabilistic guarantees on safely reaching a target, while also avoiding unsafe regions of the state space. First, we abstract the continuous control system into a finite-state model that captures noise by probabilistic transitions between discrete states. As a key contribution, we adapt tools from the scenario approach to compute probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds on these transition probabilities, based on a finite number of samples of the noise. We capture these bounds in the transition probability intervals of a so-called interval Markov decision process (iMDP). This iMDP is, with a user-specified confidence probability, robust against uncertainty in the transition probabilities, and the tightness of the probability intervals can be controlled through the number of samples. We use state-of-the-art verification techniques to provide guarantees on the iMDP and compute a controller for which these guarantees carry over to the original control system. In addition, we develop a tailored computational scheme that reduces the complexity of the synthesis of these guarantees on the iMDP. Benchmarks on realistic control systems show the practical applicability of our method, even when the iMDP has hundreds of millions of transitions. ",

    "title": "Matching Using Sufficient Dimension Reduction for Heterogeneity Causal  Effect Estimation",
    "abstract": "Causal inference plays an important role in under standing the underlying mechanisation of the data generation process across various domains. It is challenging to estimate the average causal effect and individual causal effects from observational data with high-dimensional covariates due to the curse of dimension and the problem of data sufficiency. The existing matching methods can not effectively estimate individual causal effect or solve the problem of dimension curse in causal inference. To address this challenge, in this work, we prove that the reduced set by sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) is a balance score for confounding adjustment. Under the theorem, we propose to use an SDR method to obtain a reduced representation set of the original covariates and then the reduced set is used for the matching method. In detail, a non-parametric model is used to learn such a reduced set and to avoid model specification errors. The experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the compared matching methods. Moreover, we conduct an experiment analysis and the results demonstrate that the reduced representation is enough to balance the imbalance between the treatment group and control group individuals.

    "abstract": "Capsule neural networks replace simple, scalar-valued neurons with vector-valued capsules. They are motivated by the pattern recognition system in the human brain, where complex objects are decomposed into a hierarchy of simpler object parts. Such a hierarchy is referred to as a parse-tree. Conceptually, capsule neural networks have been defined to realize such parse-trees. The capsule neural network (CapsNet), by Sabour, Frosst, and Hinton, is the first actual implementation of the conceptual idea of capsule neural networks. CapsNets achieved state-of-the-art performance on simple image recognition tasks with fewer parameters and greater robustness to affine transformations than comparable approaches. This sparked extensive follow-up research. However, despite major efforts, no work was able to scale the CapsNet architecture to more reasonable-sized datasets. Here, we provide a reason for this failure and argue that it is most likely not possible to scale CapsNets beyond toy examples. In particular, we show that the concept of a parse-tree, the main idea behind capsule neuronal networks, is not present in CapsNets. We also show theoretically and experimentally that CapsNets suffer from a vanishing gradient problem that results in the starvation of many capsules during training. ",

While achieving promising performances, current works still suffer from the complicated interactions and relationships of entities in MOOC platforms. To tackle the challenges, we formulate the problem as a course representation learning task-based and develop an Information-aware Graph Representation Learning(IaGRL) for multi-view MOOC quality evaluation. Specifically, We first build a MOOC Heterogeneous Network (HIN) to represent the interactions and relationships among entities in MOOC platforms. And then we decompose the MOOC HIN into multiple single-relation graphs based on meta-paths to depict the multi-view semantics of courses. The course representation learning can be further converted to a multi-view graph representation task. Different from traditional graph representation learning, the learned course representations are expected to match the following three types of validity: (1) the agreement on expressiveness between the raw course portfolio and the learned course representations; (2) the consistency between the representations in each view and the unified representations; (3) the alignment between the course and MOOC platform representations. Therefore, we propose to exploit mutual information for preserving the validity of course representations. We conduct extensive experiments over real-world MOOC datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than six million deaths worldwide. Medicalized hotels were established in Taiwan as quarantine facilities for COVID-19 patients with no or mild symptoms. Due to limited medical care available at these hotels, it is of paramount importance to identify patients at risk of clinical deterioration. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a graph-based deep learning approach for progressive hospital transfer risk prediction in a medicalized hotel setting. Vital sign measurements were obtained for 632 patients and daily patient similarity graphs were constructed. Inductive graph convolutional network models were trained on top of the temporally integrated graphs to predict hospital transfer risk. The proposed models achieved AUC scores above 0.83 for hospital transfer risk prediction based on the measurements of past 1, 2, and 3 days, outperforming baseline machine learning methods. A post-hoc analysis on the constructed diffusion-based graph using Local Clustering Coefficient discovered a high-risk cluster with significantly older mean age, higher body temperature, lower SpO2, and shorter length of stay. Further time-to-hospital-transfer survival analysis also revealed a significant decrease in survival probability in the discovered high-risk cluster. The obtained results demonstrated promising predictability and interpretability of the proposed graph-based approach. This technique may help preemptively detect high-risk patients at community-based medical facilities similar to a medicalized hotel. ",

    "abstract": "Global food security is an issue that is fast becoming a critical matter in the world today. Global warming, climate change and a range of other impacts caused by humans, such as carbon emissions, sociopolitical and economical challenges (e.g. war), traditional workforce/labour decline and population growth are straining global food security. The need for high-speed and reliable wireless communication in agriculture is becoming more of a necessity rather than a technological demonstration or showing superiority in the field. Governments and industries around the world are seeing more urgency in establishing communication infrastructure to scale up agricultural activities and improve sustainability, by employing autonomous agri-robotics and agri-technologies. The work presented here evaluates the physical performance of 5G in an agri-robotics application, and the results are compared against 4G and WiFi6 (a newly emerging wireless communication standard), which are typically used in agricultural environments. In addition, a series of simulation experiments were performed to assess the ``real-time'' operational delay in critical tasks that may require a human-in-the-loop to support decision making. The results lead to the conclusion that 4G cannot be used in the agricultural domain for applications that require high throughput and reliable communication between robot and user. Moreover, a single wireless solution does not exist for the agricultural domain, but instead multiple solutions can be combined to meet the necessary telecommunications requirements. Finally, the results show that 5G greatly outperforms 4G in all performance metrics, and on average only 18.2ms slower than WiFi6 making it very reliable. ",

While link prediction has been studied for general types of social networks, the evolution of SLNs over their lifetimes coupled with their dependence on which topics are being discussed presents new challenges for this type of network. To address these challenges, we develop a series of autonomous link prediction methodologies that utilize spatial and time-evolving network architectures to pass network state between space and time periods, and that models over three types of SLN features updated in each period: neighborhood-based (e.g., resource allocation), path-based (e.g., shortest path), and post-based (e.g., topic similarity). Through evaluation on six real-world datasets from Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) discussion forums and from Purdue University, we find that our method obtains substantial improvements over Bayesian models, linear classifiers, and graph neural networks, with AUCs typically above 0.91 and reaching 0.99 depending on the dataset. Our feature importance analysis shows that while neighborhood and path-based features contribute the most to the results, post-based features add additional information that may not always be relevant for link prediction.

The key designs of StereoDistill are: the X-component Guided Distillation~(XGD) for regression and the Cross-anchor Logit Distillation~(CLD) for classification. In XGD, instead of empirically adopting a threshold to select the high-quality teacher predictions as soft targets, we decompose the predicted 3D box into sub-components and retain the corresponding part for distillation if the teacher component pilot is consistent with ground truth to largely boost the number of positive predictions and alleviate the mimicking difficulty of the student model. For CLD, we aggregate the probability distribution of all anchors at the same position to encourage the highest probability anchor rather than individually distill the distribution at the anchor level. Finally, our StereoDistill achieves state-of-the-art results for stereo-based 3D detection on the KITTI test benchmark and extensive experiments on KITTI and Argoverse Dataset validate the effectiveness.

The NN device is experimentally tested with non-return-to-zero optical signals at 10 Gbps after propagation through up to 125 km optical fiber link. During the learning phase, a separation-loss function is optimized in order to maximally separate the transmitted levels of 0s from the 1s, which implies an optimization of the bit-error-rate. Testing of the NN device shows that the excess losses introduced by the NN device are compensated by the gain in transmitted signal equalization for a link longer than 100 km. The measured data are reproduced by a model which accounts for the optical link and the neural network device. This allows simulating the network performances for higher data rates, where the device shows improvement with respect to the benchmark both in terms of performance as well as ease of use. ",

    "abstract": "Reverse engineering binaries is required to understand and analyse programs for which the source code is unavailable. Decompilers can transform the largely unreadable binaries into a more readable source code-like representation. However, reverse engineering is time-consuming, much of which is taken up by labelling the functions with semantic information. While the automated summarisation of decompiled code can help Reverse Engineers understand and analyse binaries, current work mainly focuses on summarising source code, and no suitable dataset exists for this task. In this work, we extend large pre-trained language models of source code to summarise decompiled binary functions. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of input and data properties on the performance of such models. Our approach consists of two main components; the data and the model. We first build CAPYBARA, a dataset of 214K decompiled function-documentation pairs across various compiler optimisations. We extend CAPYBARA further by generating synthetic datasets and deduplicating the data. Next, we fine-tune the CodeT5 base model with CAPYBARA to create BinT5. BinT5 achieves the state-of-the-art BLEU-4 score of 60.83, 58.82, and 44.21 for summarising source, decompiled, and synthetically stripped decompiled code, respectively. This indicates that these models can be extended to decompiled binaries successfully. Finally, we found that the performance of BinT5 is not heavily dependent on the dataset size and compiler optimisation level. We recommend future research to further investigate transferring knowledge when working with less expressive input formats such as stripped binaries. ",

Most of the current work on graph adversarial attacks aims at lowering the overall prediction accuracy, but we argue that the resulting abnormal model performance may catch attention easily and invite quick counterattack. Moreover, attacks through modification of existing graph data may be hard to conduct if good security protocols are implemented. In this work, we consider an easier attack harder to be noticed, through adversarially patching the graph with new nodes and edges. The attack is universal: it targets a single node each time and flips its connection to the same set of patch nodes. The attack is unnoticeable: it does not modify the predictions of nodes other than the target. We develop an algorithm, named GUAP, that achieves high attack success rate but meanwhile preserves the prediction accuracy. GUAP is fast to train by employing a sampling strategy. We demonstrate that a 5% sampling in each epoch yields 20x speedup in training, with only a slight degradation in attack performance. Additionally, we show that the adversarial patch trained with the graph convolutional network transfers well to other GNNs, such as the graph attention network. ",

The manuscript aims, for the first time, at filling this gap by matching state-space modeling and spatio-temporal data where the relational information, say the functional graph capturing latent dependencies, is learned directly from data and is allowed to change over time. Within a probabilistic formulation that accounts for the uncertainty in the data-generating process, an encoder-decoder architecture is proposed to learn the state-space model end-to-end on a downstream task. The proposed methodological framework generalizes several state-of-the-art methods and demonstrates to be effective in extracting meaningful relational information while achieving optimal forecasting performance in controlled environments.

However, this method is extremely expensive in terms of memory cost, sometimes even becoming prohibitive.

Nevertheless LN segmentation/detection is very challenging since LN can be easily confused with other hard negative anatomic structures (e.g., vessels) from radiological images. We explore the anatomical spatial context priors of pancreatic LN locations by generating a guiding attention map from related organs and vessels to assist segmentation and infer LN status. As such, LN segmentation is impelled to focus on regions that are anatomically adjacent or plausible with respect to the specific organs and vessels. The metastasized LN identification network is trained to classify the segmented LN instances into positives or negatives by reusing the segmentation network as a pre-trained backbone and padding a new classification head. More importantly, we develop a LN metastasis status prediction network that combines the patient-wise aggregation results of LN segmentation/identification and deep imaging features extracted from the tumor region. Extensive quantitative nested five-fold cross-validation is conducted on a discovery dataset of 749 patients with PDAC. ",

    "title": "Demystify Problem-Dependent Power of Quantum Neural Networks on  Multi-Class Classification",
    "abstract": "Quantum neural networks (QNNs) have become an important tool for understanding the physical world, but their advantages and limitations are not fully understood. Some QNNs with specific encoding methods can be efficiently simulated by classical surrogates, while others with quantum memory may perform better than classical classifiers. Here we systematically investigate the problem-dependent power of quantum neural classifiers (QCs) on multi-class classification tasks. Through the analysis of expected risk, a measure that weighs the training loss and the generalization error of a classifier jointly, we identify two key findings: first, the training loss dominates the power rather than the generalization ability; second, QCs undergo a U-shaped risk curve, in contrast to the double-descent risk curve of deep neural classifiers. We also reveal the intrinsic connection between optimal QCs and the Helstrom bound and the equiangular tight frame. Using these findings, we propose a method that uses loss dynamics to probe whether a QC may be more effective than a classical classifier on a particular learning task. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to explain the superiority of QCs over multilayer Perceptron on parity datasets and their limitations over convolutional neural networks on image datasets. Our work sheds light on the problem-dependent power of QNNs and offers a practical tool for evaluating their potential merit. ",

Such characteristics arise due to the critical nature and complex interconnectivity of the brain and its neuronal network. We demonstrate that a system comprising of multilayer hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) films contacted with Silver (Ag), that can uniquely host two different self-assembled networks, which are self-organized at criticality (SOC). This system shows bipolar resistive switching between high resistance (HRS) and low resistance states (LRS). In the HRS, Ag clusters (nodes) intercalate in the van der Waals gaps of hBN forming a network of tunnel junctions, whereas the LRS contains a network of Ag filaments. The temporal avalanche dynamics in both these states exhibit power-law scaling, long-range temporal correlation, and SOC. These networks can be tuned from one to another with voltage as a control parameter. For the first time, different neuron-like networks are realized in a single CMOS compatible, 2D materials platform. ",

    "abstract": "There is a recent trend to leverage the power of graph neural networks (GNNs) for brain-network based psychiatric diagnosis, which,in turn, also motivates an urgent need for psychiatrists to fully understand the decision behavior of the used GNNs. However, most of the existing GNN explainers are either post-hoc in which another interpretive model needs to be created to explain a well-trained GNN, or do not consider the causal relationship between the extracted explanation and the decision, such that the explanation itself contains spurious correlations and suffers from weak faithfulness. In this work, we propose a granger causality-inspired graph neural network (CI-GNN), a built-in interpretable model that is able to identify the most influential subgraph (i.e., functional connectivity within brain regions) that is causally related to the decision (e.g., major depressive disorder patients or healthy controls), without the training of an auxillary interpretive network. CI-GNN learns disentangled subgraph-level representations {\\alpha} and \\b{eta} that encode, respectively, the causal and noncausal aspects of original graph under a graph variational autoencoder framework, regularized by a conditional mutual information (CMI) constraint. We theoretically justify the validity of the CMI regulation in capturing the causal relationship. We also empirically evaluate the performance of CI-GNN against three baseline GNNs and four state-of-the-art GNN explainers on synthetic data and two large-scale brain disease datasets. We observe that CI-GNN achieves the best performance in a wide range of metrics and provides more reliable and concise explanations which have clinical evidence. ",

    "abstract": "As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to impact many aspects of life and the global healthcare systems, the adoption of rapid and effective screening methods to prevent further spread of the virus and lessen the burden on healthcare providers is a necessity. As a cheap and widely accessible medical image modality, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) imaging allows radiologists to identify symptoms and assess severity through visual inspection of the chest ultrasound images. Combined with the recent advancements in computer science, applications of deep learning techniques in medical image analysis have shown promising results, demonstrating that artificial intelligence-based solutions can accelerate the diagnosis of COVID-19 and lower the burden on healthcare professionals. However, the lack of a huge amount of well-annotated data poses a challenge in building effective deep neural networks in the case of novel diseases and pandemics. Motivated by this, we present COVID-Net USPro, an explainable few-shot deep prototypical network, that monitors and detects COVID-19 positive cases with high precision and recall from minimal ultrasound images. COVID-Net USPro achieves 99.65% overall accuracy, 99.7% recall and 99.67% precision for COVID-19 positive cases when trained with only 5 shots. The analytic pipeline and results were verified by our contributing clinician with extensive experience in POCUS interpretation, ensuring that the network makes decisions based on actual patterns. ",

The Saint-Venant system describes the movement of a tank which contains a viscous liquid. We assume constant contact angles between the liquid and the walls of the tank and we achieve a spill-free exponential stabilization with robustness to surface tension by using a Control Lyapunov Functional (CLF). The proposed CLF provides a parameterized family of sets which approximate the state space from the interior. Based on the CLF, we construct a nonlinear stabilizing feedback law which ensures that the closed-loop system converges exponentially to the desired equilibrium point in the sense of an appropriate norm.

    "abstract": "Motion artifact reduction is one of the most concerned problems in magnetic resonance imaging. As a promising solution, deep learning-based methods have been widely investigated for artifact reduction tasks in MRI. As a retrospective processing method, neural network does not cost additional acquisition time or require new acquisition equipment, and seems to work better than traditional artifact reduction methods. In the previous study, training such models require the paired motion-corrupted and motion-free MR images. However, it is extremely tough or even impossible to obtain these images in reality because patients have difficulty in maintaining the same state during two image acquisition, which makes the training in a supervised manner impractical. In this work, we proposed a new unsupervised abnomality extraction network (UNAEN) to alleviate this problem. Our network realizes the transition from artifact domain to motion-free domain by processing the abnormal information introduced by artifact in unpaired MR images. Different from directly generating artifact reduction results from motion-corrupted MR images, we adopted the strategy of abnomality extraction to indirectly correct the impact of artifact in MR images by learning the deep features. Experimental results show that our method is superior to state-of-the-art networks and can potentially be applied in real clinical settings. ",
