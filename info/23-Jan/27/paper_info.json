    "abstract": "Side-channel analysis (SCA) can obtain information related to the secret key by exploiting leakages produced by the device. Researchers recently found that neural networks (NNs) can execute a powerful profiling SCA, even on targets protected with countermeasures. This paper explores the effectiveness of Neuroevolution to Attack Side-channel Traces Yielding Convolutional Neural Networks (NASCTY-CNNs), a novel genetic algorithm approach that applies genetic operators on architectures' hyperparameters to produce CNNs for side-channel analysis automatically. The results indicate that we can achieve performance close to state-of-the-art approaches on desynchronized leakages with mask protection, demonstrating that similar neuroevolution methods provide a solid venue for further research. Finally, the commonalities among the constructed NNs provide information on how NASCTY builds effective architectures and deals with the applied countermeasures. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) achieve remarkable performance in graph machine learning tasks but can be hard to train on large-graph data, where their learning dynamics are not well understood. We investigate the training dynamics of large-graph GNNs using graph neural tangent kernels (GNTKs) and graphons. In the limit of large width, optimization of an overparametrized NN is equivalent to kernel regression on the NTK. Here, we investigate how the GNTK evolves as another independent dimension is varied: the graph size. We use graphons to define limit objects -- graphon NNs for GNNs, and graphon NTKs for GNTKs, and prove that, on a sequence of growing graphs, the GNTKs converge to the graphon NTK. We further prove that the eigenspaces of the GNTK, which are related to the problem learning directions and associated learning speeds, converge to the spectrum of the GNTK. This implies that in the large-graph limit, the GNTK fitted on a graph of moderate size can be used to solve the same task on the large-graph and infer the learning dynamics of the large-graph GNN. These results are verified empirically on node regression and node classification tasks. ",

    "abstract": "The state-of-the-art predictive maintenance (PdM) techniques have shown great success in reducing maintenance costs and downtime of complicated machines while increasing overall productivity through extensive utilization of Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Deep Learning (DL). Unfortunately, IoT sensors and DL algorithms are both prone to cyber-attacks. For instance, DL algorithms are known for their susceptibility to adversarial examples. Such adversarial attacks are vastly under-explored in the PdM domain. This is because the adversarial attacks in the computer vision domain for classification tasks cannot be directly applied to the PdM domain for multivariate time series (MTS) regression tasks. In this work, we propose an end-to-end methodology to design adversarially robust PdM systems by extensively analyzing the effect of different types of adversarial attacks and proposing a novel adversarial defense technique for DL-enabled PdM models. First, we propose novel MTS Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and MTS PGD with random restarts (PGD_r) attacks. Then, we evaluate the impact of MTS PGD and PGD_r along with MTS Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and MTS Basic Iterative Method (BIM) on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Bi-directional LSTM based PdM system. Our results using NASA's turbofan engine dataset show that adversarial attacks can cause a severe defect (up to 11X) in the RUL prediction, outperforming the effectiveness of the state-of-the-art PdM attacks by 3X. Furthermore, we present a novel approximate adversarial training method to defend against adversarial attacks. We observe that approximate adversarial training can significantly improve the robustness of PdM models (up to 54X) and outperforms the state-of-the-art PdM defense methods by offering 3X more robustness.

During a global turbulence as significant as the COVID-19 pandemic, such changes are inevitable. Here we examine how the effects of COVID-19 on various jurisdictions influenced the global price of Bitcoin. We hypothesize that lock downs and expectations of economic recession erode people trust in fiat (government-issued) currencies, thus elevating cryptocurrencies. Hence, we expect to identify a causal relation between the turbulence caused by the pandemic, demand for Bitcoin, and ultimately its price. To test the hypothesis, we merged datasets of Bitcoin prices and COVID-19 cases and deaths. We also engineered extra features and applied statistical and machine learning (ML) models. We applied a Random Forest model (RF) to identify and rank the feature importance, and ran a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model on Bitcoin prices data set twice: with and without accounting for COVID-19 related features. We find that adding COVID-19 data into the LSTM model improved prediction of Bitcoin prices. ",

However, one of the main limitations of existing methods is their large output space, which limits generation scalability and hinders accurate modeling of the underlying distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach that significantly reduces the output space of existing graph generative models. Specifically, starting from the observation that many real-world graphs have low graph bandwidth, we restrict graph bandwidth during training and generation. Our strategy improves both generation scalability and quality without increasing architectural complexity or reducing expressiveness. Our approach is compatible with existing graph generative methods, and we describe its application to both autoregressive and one-shot models. We extensively validate our strategy on synthetic and real datasets, including molecular graphs. Our experiments show that, in addition to improving generation efficiency, our approach consistently improves generation quality and reconstruction accuracy. The implementation is made available. ",

Recent works have explored data-driven methods for learning convex objectives, but learning their monotone gradients is seldom studied. In this work, we propose Cascaded and Modular Monotone Gradient Networks (C-MGN and M-MGN respectively), two monotone gradient neural network architectures for directly learning the gradients of convex functions. We show that our networks are simpler to train, learn monotone gradient fields more accurately, and use significantly fewer parameters than state of the art methods.

To address the uncertainty in reconstructing entire shapes from single-viewpoint occluded images, we propose a framework for generative virtual learning of shape reconstruction using image translation with common latent variables between simulated and real images. As it is difficult to prepare sufficient amount of data to learn the relationship between endoscopic images and organ shapes, self-supervised virtual learning is performed using simulated images generated from statistical shape models. However, small differences between virtual and real images can degrade the estimation performance even if the simulated images are regarded as equivalent by humans. To address this issue, a Variational Autoencoder is used to convert real and simulated images into identical synthetic images. In this study, we targeted the shape reconstruction of collapsed lungs from thoracoscopic images and confirmed that virtual learning could improve the similarity between real and simulated images. Furthermore, shape reconstruction error could be improved by 16.9%. ",

Using graph transformer networks, coupled with modelling attention and BERT-level natural language processing, our approach can capture context and anticipate upcoming anti-social behaviour. In this paper, we offer a detailed qualitative analysis of this solution for hate speech detection in social networks, leading to insights into where the method has the most impressive outcomes in comparison with competitors and identifying scenarios where there are challenges to achieving ideal performance. Included is an exploration of the kinds of posts that permeate social media today, including the use of hateful images. This suggests avenues for extending our model to be more comprehensive. A key insight is that the focus on reasoning about the concept of context positions us well to be able to support multi-modal analysis of online posts. We conclude with a reflection on how the problem we are addressing relates especially well to the theme of dynamic change, a critical concern for all AI solutions for social impact. We also comment briefly on how mental health well-being can be advanced with our work, through curated content attuned to the extent of hate in posts. ",

In such drawings, the two sets of entities (vertices) are placed on two parallel lines (layers), and their relationships (edges) are represented by segments connecting vertices. Methods for constructing 2-layer drawings often try to minimize the number of edge crossings. We use vertex splitting to reduce the number of crossings, by replacing selected vertices on one layer by two (or more) copies and suitably distributing their incident edges among these copies. We study several optimization problems related to vertex splits to minimize the number of crossings. While we prove that some variants are NP-complete, we obtain polynomial-time algorithms for others. We run our algorithms on a benchmark set of bipartite graphs representing the relationships between human anatomical structures and cell types. ",

    "abstract": "Contemporary approaches to instance segmentation in cell science use 2D or 3D convolutional networks depending on the experiment and data structures. However, limitations in microscopy systems or efforts to prevent phototoxicity commonly require recording sub-optimally sampled data regimes that greatly reduces the utility of such 3D data, especially in crowded environments with significant axial overlap between objects. In such regimes, 2D segmentations are both more reliable for cell morphology and easier to annotate. In this work, we propose the Projection Enhancement Network (PEN), a novel convolutional module which processes the sub-sampled 3D data and produces a 2D RGB semantic compression, and is trained in conjunction with an instance segmentation network of choice to produce 2D segmentations. Our approach combines augmentation to increase cell density using a low-density cell image dataset to train PEN, and curated datasets to evaluate PEN. We show that with PEN, the learned semantic representation in CellPose encodes depth and greatly improves segmentation performance in comparison to maximum intensity projection images as input, but does not similarly aid segmentation in region-based networks like Mask-RCNN. Finally, we dissect the segmentation strength against cell density of PEN with CellPose on disseminated cells from side-by-side spheroids. We present PEN as a data-driven solution to form compressed representations of 3D data that improve 2D segmentations from instance segmentation networks. ",

Though modern neural networks have achieved impressive performance on both vision and language tasks, we know little about the functions that they implement. One possibility is that neural networks implicitly break down complex tasks into subroutines, implement modular solutions to these subroutines, and compose them into an overall solution to a task -- a property we term structural compositionality. Or they may simply learn to match new inputs to memorized representations, eliding task decomposition entirely. Here, we leverage model pruning techniques to investigate this question in both vision and language, across a variety of architectures, tasks, and pretraining regimens. Our results demonstrate that models oftentimes implement solutions to subroutines via modular subnetworks, which can be ablated while maintaining the functionality of other subroutines. This suggests that neural networks may be able to learn to exhibit compositionality, obviating the need for specialized symbolic mechanisms. ",

In this study, we propose to treat this neglected text as privileged information available during training to enhance early prediction modeling through knowledge distillation, presented as Learning using Privileged tIme-sEries Text (LuPIET). We evaluate the method on clinical and social media text, with four clinical prediction tasks based on clinical notes and two mental health prediction tasks based on social media posts. Our results show LuPIET is effective in enhancing text-based early predictions, though one may need to consider choosing the appropriate text representation and windows for privileged text to achieve optimal performance. Compared to two other methods using transfer learning and mixed training, LuPIET offers more stable improvements over the baseline, standard training.

This new methodology allows us to: (i) effectively detect web tracking code even when using evasion techniques (e.g., obfuscation, minification, or webpackaging); and (ii) safely remove those portions of code related to tracking purposes without affecting the legitimate functionality of the website. Our evaluation with the top 10k most popular Internet domains shows that ASTrack can detect web tracking with high precision (98%), while discovering about 50k tracking code pieces and more than 3,400 new tracking URLs not previously recognized by most popular privacy-preserving tools (e.g., uBlock Origin). Moreover, ASTrack achieved a 36% reduction in functionality loss in comparison with the filter lists, one of the safest options available.

In this work, we propose CREPE, the first benchmark on causal reasoning about event plausibility based on entity states. We experiment with strong large language models and show that most models including GPT3 perform close to chance of .30 F1, lagging far behind the human performance of .87 F1. Inspired by the finding that structured representations such as programming languages benefits event reasoning as a prompt to code language models such as Codex, we creatively inject the causal relations between entities and events through intermediate variables and boost the performance to .67 to .72 F1. Our proposed event representation not only allows for knowledge injection, but also marks the first successful attempt of chain-of-thought reasoning with code language models. ",

However, we argue that such context is still \\textit{local} since the rich cross-sequence relations have not been explicitly investigated. In this paper, we propose a graph contrastive learning framework for skeleton-based action recognition (\\textit{SkeletonGCL}) to explore the \\textit{global} context across all sequences. In specific, SkeletonGCL associates graph learning across sequences by enforcing graphs to be class-discriminative, \\emph{i.e.,} intra-class compact and inter-class dispersed, which improves the GCN capacity to distinguish various action patterns. Besides, two memory banks are designed to enrich cross-sequence context from two complementary levels, \\emph{i.e.,} instance and semantic levels, enabling graph contrastive learning in multiple context scales. Consequently, SkeletonGCL establishes a new training paradigm, and it can be seamlessly incorporated into current GCNs. Without loss of generality, we combine SkeletonGCL with three GCNs (2S-ACGN, CTR-GCN, and InfoGCN), and achieve consistent improvements on NTU60, NTU120, and NW-UCLA benchmarks.

Using CD and the distilled CPs, we uncover an interesting phenomenon of backdoor attacks: despite the various forms and sizes of trigger patterns used by different attacks, the CPs of backdoor samples are all surprisingly and suspiciously small. One thus can leverage the learned mask to detect and remove backdoor examples from poisoned training datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to show that CD can robustly detect a wide range of advanced backdoor attacks. We also show that CD can potentially be applied to help detect potential biases from face datasets. Code is available at \\url{https://github.com/HanxunH/CognitiveDistillation}. ",

    "abstract": "Click-through prediction (CTR) models transform features into latent vectors and enumerate possible feature interactions to improve performance based on the input feature set. Therefore, when selecting an optimal feature set, we should consider the influence of both feature and its interaction. However, most previous works focus on either feature field selection or only select feature interaction based on the fixed feature set to produce the feature set. The former restricts search space to the feature field, which is too coarse to determine subtle features. They also do not filter useless feature interactions, leading to higher computation costs and degraded model performance. The latter identifies useful feature interaction from all available features, resulting in many redundant features in the feature set. In this paper, we propose a novel method named OptFS to address these problems. To unify the selection of feature and its interaction, we decompose the selection of each feature interaction into the selection of two correlated features. Such a decomposition makes the model end-to-end trainable given various feature interaction operations. By adopting feature-level search space, we set a learnable gate to determine whether each feature should be within the feature set. Because of the large-scale search space, we develop a learning-by-continuation training scheme to learn such gates. Hence, OptFS generates the feature set only containing features which improve the final prediction results. Experimentally, we evaluate OptFS on three public datasets, demonstrating OptFS can optimize feature sets which enhance the model performance and further reduce both the storage and computational cost.

    "abstract": "Due to its high cost-effectiveness, sparsity has become the most important approach for building efficient deep-learning models. However, commodity accelerators are built mainly for efficient dense computation, creating a huge gap for general sparse computation to leverage. Existing solutions have to use time-consuming compiling to improve the efficiency of sparse kernels in an ahead-of-time manner and thus are limited to static sparsity. A wide range of dynamic sparsity opportunities is missed because their sparsity patterns are only known at runtime. This limits the future of building more biological brain-like neural networks that should be dynamically and sparsely activated. In this paper, we bridge the gap between sparse computation and commodity accelerators by proposing a system, called Spider, for efficiently executing deep learning models with dynamic sparsity. We identify an important property called permutation invariant that applies to most deep-learning computations. The property enables Spider (1) to extract dynamic sparsity patterns of tensors that are only known at runtime with little overhead; and (2) to transform the dynamic sparse computation into an equivalent dense computation which has been extremely optimized on commodity accelerators. Extensive evaluation on diverse models shows Spider can extract and transform dynamic sparsity with negligible overhead but brings up to 9.4x speedup over state-of-art solutions. ",

In this paper, we train a representation learning method that uses local and global representations of the language and vision through an attention mechanism and based on the publicly available Indiana University Radiology Report (IU-RR) dataset. Furthermore, we use the learned representations to diagnose five lung pathologies: atelectasis, cardiomegaly, edema, pleural effusion, and consolidation. Finally, we use both supervised and zero-shot classifications to extensively analyze the performance of the representation learning on the IU-RR dataset. Average Area Under the Curve (AUC) is used to evaluate the accuracy of the classifiers for classifying the five lung pathologies. The average AUC for classifying the five lung pathologies on the IU-RR test set ranged from 0.85 to 0.87 using the different training datasets, namely CheXpert and CheXphoto. These results compare favorably to other studies using UI-RR. Extensive experiments confirm consistent results for classifying lung pathologies using the multimodal global local representations of language and vision information. ",

In our analysis, we consider graph generation processes that are controlled by hidden node features, which contain all information about the graph structure. A typical example of this framework is kNN graphs constructed from the hidden features. In our main results, we show that GNNs can recover the hidden node features from the input graph alone, even when all node features, including the hidden features themselves and any indirect hints, are unavailable. GNNs can further use the recovered node features for downstream tasks. These results show that GNNs can fully exploit the graph structure by themselves, and in effect, GNNs can use both the hidden and explicit node features for downstream tasks. In the experiments, we confirm the validity of our results by showing that GNNs can accurately recover the hidden features using a GNN architecture built based on our theoretical analysis. ",

Moreover, a dual subspace is invariant if and only if the corresponding partition is equitable, i.e., for every two (not necessarily different) cells of the partition, every two states in the former have equally many out-neighbors in the latter. With the help of equitable partitions of an STG, we study the structural properties of the smallest invariant dual subspaces containing a number of Boolean functions. And then, we give algorithms for computing the equitable partition corresponding to the smallest invariant dual subspace containing a given dual subspace. Moreover, we reveal that the unobservable subspace of a BN is the smallest invariant dual subspace containing the output function. We analyze properties of the unobservable subspace by using the obtained structural properties. The graphical representation provides an easier and more intuitive way to characterizing the (smallest) invariant dual subspaces of a BN. ",

    "abstract": "The marriage of federated learning and recommender system (FedRec) has been widely used to address the growing data privacy concerns in personalized recommendation services. In FedRecs, users' attribute information and behavior data (i.e., user-item interaction data) are kept locally on their personal devices, therefore, it is considered a fairly secure approach to protect user privacy. As a result, the privacy issue of FedRecs is rarely explored. Unfortunately, several recent studies reveal that FedRecs are vulnerable to user attribute inference attacks, highlighting the privacy concerns of FedRecs. In this paper, we further investigate the privacy problem of user behavior data (i.e., user-item interactions) in FedRecs. Specifically, we perform the first systematic study on interaction-level membership inference attacks on FedRecs. An interaction-level membership inference attacker is first designed, and then the classical privacy protection mechanism, Local Differential Privacy (LDP), is adopted to defend against the membership inference attack. Unfortunately, the empirical analysis shows that LDP is not effective against such new attacks unless the recommendation performance is largely compromised. To mitigate the interaction-level membership attack threats, we design a simple yet effective defense method to significantly reduce the attacker's inference accuracy without losing recommendation performance. Extensive experiments are conducted with two widely used FedRecs (Fed-NCF and Fed-LightGCN) on three real-world recommendation datasets (MovieLens-100K, Steam-200K, and Amazon Cell Phone), and the experimental results show the effectiveness of our solutions.

We investigate real-time ML in a federated edge intelligence (FEI) system, an edge computing system that implements federated learning (FL) solutions based on data samples collected and uploaded from decentralized data networks. FEI systems often exhibit heterogenous communication and computational resource distribution, as well as non-i.i.d. data samples, resulting in long model training time and inefficient resource utilization. Motivated by this fact, we propose a time-sensitive federated learning (TS-FL) framework to minimize the overall run-time for collaboratively training a shared ML model. Training acceleration solutions for both TS-FL with synchronous coordination (TS-FL-SC) and asynchronous coordination (TS-FL-ASC) are investigated. To address straggler effect in TS-FL-SC, we develop an analytical solution to characterize the impact of selecting different subsets of edge servers on the overall model training time. A server dropping-based solution is proposed to allow slow-performance edge servers to be removed from participating in model training if their impact on the resulting model accuracy is limited. A joint optimization algorithm is proposed to minimize the overall time consumption of model training by selecting participating edge servers, local epoch number. We develop an analytical expression to characterize the impact of staleness effect of asynchronous coordination and straggler effect of FL on the time consumption of TS-FL-ASC. Experimental results show that TS-FL-SC and TS-FL-ASC can provide up to 63% and 28% of reduction, in the overall model training time, respectively. ",

In this work we leverage recent advances in neural variational inference and present an alternative neural approach to the dynamic Focused Topic Model. Indeed, we develop a neural model for topic evolution which exploits sequences of Bernoulli random variables in order to track the appearances of topics, thereby decoupling their activities from their proportions. We evaluate our model on three different datasets (the UN general debates, the collection of NeurIPS papers, and the ACL Anthology dataset) and show that it (i) outperforms state-of-the-art topic models in generalization tasks and (ii) performs comparably to them on prediction tasks, while employing roughly the same number of parameters, and converging about two times faster.

However, we argue that more consequential and explainable research is required for optimal impact on clinical psychology practice and personalized mental healthcare.

Within the scope of Natural Language Processing (NLP), we further explore critical areas of inquiry associated with these two dimensions, specifically through recent advancements in discourse analysis. This position paper guides the community to explore solutions in this space and advance the state of practice in developing conversational agents for inferring mental health from social media.

The objective of this work is to determine the optimal sector beamwidth for a cellular architecture served by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) acting as a base station (BS). The users in a cell are assumed to be distributed according to a Poisson Point Process (PPP) with a given user density. We consider hybrid beamforming at the UAV, such that multiple concurrent beams serve all the sectors simultaneously. An optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate over a given area while limiting the total power available to each sector. We observe that, for a given transmit power, the optimal sector beamwidth increases as the user density in a cell decreases, and varies based on the height of the UAV. Thus, we provide guidelines towards the optimal beamforming configurations for users in rural areas. ",

Most of the recent state-of-the-art methods are based on deep image feature representations from traditional CNNs. However, the traditional convolution could not capture the global features of the image well due to its small kernel size. Besides, the high-level factors which closely correlate to human visual perception, e.g., objects, color, light, etc., are not considered. Inspired by these, we propose a Transformer-based method with semantic segmentation as another learning objective. More global cues of the image could be captured by Transformer. In addition, simultaneously learning the object segmentation simulates the human visual perception, which we would verify in our investigation of human gaze control in cognitive science. We build an extra decoder for the subtask and the multiple tasks share the same Transformer encoder, forcing it to learn from multiple feature spaces. We find in practice simply adding the subtask might confuse the main task learning, hence Multi-task Attention Module is proposed to deal with the feature interaction between the multiple learning targets.

QeBERT exploits BERT-based embedding and Citation Network Analysis (CNA) in query expansion for improving scholarly search. Specifically, we use the context-aware BERT-embedding and CNA for query expansion in Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) fash-ion. Initial experimental results on the ACL dataset show that BERT-embedding can provide a valuable augmentation to query expansion and improve search relevance when combined with CNA. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years discussions centered around digital inheritance have increased among social media users and across blockchain ecosystems. As a result digital assets such as social media content cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens have become increasingly valuable and widespread, leading to the need for clear and secure mechanisms for transferring these assets upon the testators death or incapacitation. This study proposes a framework for digital inheritance using soulbound tokens and the social recovery pallet as a use case in the Polkadot and Kusama blockchain networks. The findings discussed within this study suggest that while soulbound tokens and the social recovery pallet offer a promising solution for creating a digital inheritance plan the findings also raise important considerations for testators digital executors and developers. While further research is needed to fully understand the potential impacts and risks of other technologies such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing this study provides a primer for users to begin planning a digital inheritance strategy and for developers to develop a more intuitive solution.

    "abstract": "Graphs are widely used to represent the relations among entities. When one owns the complete data, an entire graph can be easily built, therefore performing analysis on the graph is straightforward. However, in many scenarios, it is impractical to centralize the data due to data privacy concerns. An organization or party only keeps a part of the whole graph data, i.e., graph data is isolated from different parties. Recently, Federated Learning (FL) has been proposed to solve the data isolation issue, mainly for Euclidean data. It is still a challenge to apply FL on graph data because graphs contain topological information which is notorious for its non-IID nature and is hard to partition. In this work, we propose a novel FL framework for graph data, FedCog, to efficiently handle coupled graphs that are a kind of distributed graph data, but widely exist in a variety of real-world applications such as mobile carriers' communication networks and banks' transaction networks. We theoretically prove the correctness and security of FedCog. Experimental results demonstrate that our method FedCog significantly outperforms traditional FL methods on graphs. Remarkably, our FedCog improves the accuracy of node classification tasks by up to 14.7%. ",

A counterfactual explanation (CE) is a minimal perturbed data point for which the decision of the model changes. Most of the existing methods can only provide one CE, which may not be achievable for the user. In this work we derive an iterative method to calculate robust CEs, i.e. CEs that remain valid even after the features are slightly perturbed. To this end, our method provides a whole region of CEs allowing the user to choose a suitable recourse to obtain a desired outcome. We use algorithmic ideas from robust optimization and prove convergence results for the most common machine learning methods including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. Our experiments show that our method can efficiently generate globally optimal robust CEs for a variety of common data sets and classification models. ",

To this purpose, our analysis proposes a number of performance metrics derived using stochastic geometry (SG). On the one hand, the first moments and the marginal distribution of the IPD are calculated. On the other hand, bounds on the joint distributions of rate and IPD are provided for two scenarios: when it is relevant to obtain IPD values above a given threshold (for energy harvesting purposes), and when these values should instead remain below the threshold (for public health reasons). In addition to deriving these metrics, this work incorporates features related to UCCFNs which are new in SG models: a power allocation based on collective channel statistics, as well as the presence of potential overlaps between adjacent clusters. Our numerical results illustrate the achievable trade-offs between the rate and IPD performance. For the considered system, these results also highlight the existence of an optimal node density maximizing the joint distributions.

The existing work on FedRL assumes that all participating agents are homogeneous, which requires all agents to share the same policy parameterization (e.g., network architectures and training configurations). However, in real-world applications, agents are often in disagreement about the architecture and the parameters, possibly also because of disparate computational budgets. Because homogeneity is not given in practice, we introduce the problem setting of Federated Reinforcement Learning with Heterogeneous And bLack-box agEnts (FedRL-HALE). We present the unique challenges this new setting poses and propose the Federated Heterogeneous Q-Learning (FedHQL) algorithm that principally addresses these challenges. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of FedHQL in boosting the sample efficiency of heterogeneous agents with distinct policy parameterization using standard RL tasks. ",

Meta-RL (MRL) addresses this issue by learning a meta-policy that adapts to new tasks. Standard MRL methods optimize the average return over tasks, but often suffer from poor results in tasks of high risk or difficulty. This limits system reliability whenever test tasks are not known in advance. In this work, we propose a robust MRL objective with a controlled robustness level. Optimization of analogous robust objectives in RL often leads to both biased gradients and data inefficiency. We prove that the former disappears in MRL, and address the latter via the novel Robust Meta RL algorithm (RoML). RoML is a meta-algorithm that generates a robust version of any given MRL algorithm, by identifying and over-sampling harder tasks throughout training. We demonstrate that RoML learns substantially different meta-policies and achieves robust returns on several navigation and continuous control benchmarks. ",

Malware that viciously targets every industry, every sector, every enterprise and even individuals has shown its capabilities to take entire business organizations offline and cause significant financial damage in billions of dollars annually. Malware authors are constantly evolving in their attack strategies and sophistication and are developing malware that is difficult to detect and can lay dormant in the background for quite some time in order to evade security controls. Given the above argument, Traditional approaches to malware detection are no longer effective. As a result, deep learning models have become an emerging trend to detect and classify malware. This paper proposes a new convolutional deep learning neural network to accurately and effectively detect malware with high precision. This paper is different than most other papers in the literature in that it uses an expert data science approach by developing a convolutional neural network from scratch to establish a baseline of the performance model first, explores and implements an improvement model from the baseline model, and finally it evaluates the performance of the final model. The baseline model initially achieves 98% accurate rate but after increasing the depth of the CNN model, its accuracy reaches 99.183 which outperforms most of the CNN models in the literature. Finally, to further solidify the effectiveness of this CNN model, we use the improved model to make predictions on new malware samples within our dataset. ",

Upon studying symmetries of the simplicial domain and the data space, it is shown to be permutation and orientation equivariant, thus, incorporating such inductive biases.

In this paper, we propose a graph network model for graph coloring, which is a class of representative heterophilous problems. Different from the conventional graph networks, we introduce negative message passing into the proposed graph neural network for more effective information exchange in handling graph coloring problems. Moreover, a new loss function taking into account the self-information of the nodes is suggested to accelerate the learning process. Experimental studies are carried out to compare the proposed graph model with five state-of-the-art algorithms on ten publicly available graph coloring problems and one real-world application.

The over-increasing Winograd parameters not only exacerbate training complexity but also barricade the practical speedups due simply to the volume of element-wise products in the Winograd domain. We attempt to reduce trainable parameters by introducing a low-rank Winograd transformation, a novel training paradigm that decouples the original large tensor into two less storage-required trainable tensors, leading to a significant complexity reduction. Built upon our low-rank Winograd transformation, we take one step ahead by proposing a low-rank oriented sparse granularity that measures column-wise parameter importance. By simply involving the non-zero columns in the element-wise product, our sparse granularity is empowered with the ability to produce a very regular sparse pattern to acquire effectual Winograd speedups. To better understand the efficacy of our method, we perform extensive experiments on 3D CNNs. Results manifest that our low-rank Winograd transformation well outperforms the vanilla Winograd transformation. We also show that our proposed low-rank oriented sparse granularity permits practical Winograd acceleration compared with the vanilla counterpart. ",

While the UAV-enabled network has been studied extensively, most of the works focus on the spatial average performance, such as coverage probability, while SINR meta distribution has received less attention. In this paper, we use the SINR meta distribution for the first time to systematically analyze the improvement and the influence of deploying UAVs on the reliability of a wireless network. We first derive the $b$-th moments of the conditional success probability of the UAV-enabled network and give the approximated expressions derived by Gil-Pelaez theorem and the beta approximation of the meta distribution. Our numerical results show that deploying UAVs in wireless networks in most cases can greatly improve the system reliability, which denotes the fraction of users achieving cellular coverage, especially for the spatially-clustered users. In addition, establishing LoS links is not always beneficial since it also increases the interference. For instance, with the increase of the SINR threshold, the system reliability of a high LoS probability environment decreases dramatically and it is even lower than a low LoS probability environment. We also show that in highrise urban areas, UAVs can help in establishing extremely reliable (very high SINR) links. ",

For the problems of maximal independent set (MIS), maximal matching (MM), and vertex coloring, we improve the state of the art as follows. Let $\\lambda$ denote the arboricity of the $n$-node input graph with maximum degree $\\Delta$. MIS and MM: We develop a deterministic fully-scalable algorithm that reduces the maximum degree to $poly(\\lambda)$ in $O(\\log \\log n)$ rounds, improving and simplifying the randomized $O(\\log \\log n)$-round $poly(\\max(\\lambda, \\log n))$-degree reduction of Ghaffari, Grunau, Jin [DISC'20]. Our approach when combined with the state-of-the-art $O(\\log \\Delta + \\log \\log n)$-round algorithm by Czumaj, Davies, Parter [SPAA'20, TALG'21] leads to an improved deterministic round complexity of $O(\\log \\lambda + \\log \\log n)$ for MIS and MM in low-space MPC. We also extend above MIS and MM algorithms to work with linear global memory. Specifically, we show that both problems can be solved in deterministic time $O(\\min(\\log n, \\log \\lambda \\cdot \\log \\log n))$, and even in $O(\\log \\log n)$ time for graphs with arboricity at most $\\log^{O(1)} \\log n$. In this setting, only a $O(\\log^2 \\log n)$-running time bound for trees was known due to Latypov and Uitto [ArXiv'21]. Vertex Coloring: We present a $O(1)$-round deterministic algorithm for the problem of $O(\\lambda)$-coloring in linear-memory MPC with relaxed global memory of $n \\cdot poly(\\lambda)$ that solves the problem after just one single graph partitioning step.

Existing methods either ignore or utilize only abstracts indiscriminately from references, failing to tackle the challenge mentioned above. To fill the gap, we propose a novel citation-aware scientific paper summarization framework based on the citation graph, with the ability to accurately locate and incorporate the salient contents from references, as well as capture varying relevance between source papers and their references. Specifically, we first build a domain-specific dataset PubMedCite with about 192K biomedical scientific papers and a large citation graph preserving 917K citation relationships between them. It is characterized by preserving the salient contents extracted from full texts of references, and the weighted correlation between the salient contents of references and the source paper. Based on it, we design a self-supervised citation-aware summarization framework (CitationSum) with graph contrastive learning, which boosts the summarization generation by efficiently fusing the salient information in references with source paper contents under the guidance of their correlations. Experimental results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, due to efficiently leveraging the information of references and citation correlations. ",

    "abstract": "Hypergraphs, describing networks where interactions take place among any number of units, are a natural tool to model many real-world social and biological systems. In this work we propose a principled framework to model the organization of higher-order data. Our approach recovers community structure with accuracy exceeding that of currently available state-of-the-art algorithms, as tested in synthetic benchmarks with both hard and overlapping ground-truth partitions. Our model is flexible and does not impose restrictive assumptions encountered in previous works, allowing to capture unexplored mesoscale configurations, such as disassortative community structure. Moreover, our method scales orders of magnitude faster than competing algorithms, making it suitable for the analysis of very large hypergraphs, containing millions of nodes and interactions among thousands of nodes. Our work constitutes a practical and general tool for hypergraph analysis, broadening our understanding of the organization of real-world higher-order systems. ",

However, recent research has shown that applying existing binarization algorithms to diverse tasks, architectures, and hardware in realistic scenarios is still not straightforward. Common challenges of binarization, such as accuracy degradation and efficiency limitation, suggest that its attributes are not fully understood. To close this gap, we present BiBench, a rigorously designed benchmark with in-depth analysis for network binarization. We first carefully scrutinize the requirements of binarization in the actual production and define evaluation tracks and metrics for a comprehensive and fair investigation. Then, we evaluate and analyze a series of milestone binarization algorithms that function at the operator level and with extensive influence. Our benchmark reveals that 1) the binarized operator has a crucial impact on the performance and deployability of binarized networks; 2) the accuracy of binarization varies significantly across different learning tasks and neural architectures; 3) binarization has demonstrated promising efficiency potential on edge devices despite the limited hardware support. The results and analysis also lead to a promising paradigm for accurate and efficient binarization. We believe that BiBench will contribute to the broader adoption of binarization and serve as a foundation for future research. ",

We achieve this by proposing a variance-based sampling technique that effectively discriminates between the free and occupied space. The new representation requires less memory footprint and can be transmitted across limitedbandwidth communication channels. The framework is extensively evaluated in simulation and it is also demonstrated using a real mobile robot equipped with a 3D LiDAR.

However, in a nursing home scenario, common sensors and techniques used to track an elderly living alone are not suitable. In this paper, we design a location-based tracking system for a four-story nursing home - The Salvation Army, Peacehaven Nursing Home in Singapore. The main challenge here is to identify the group activity among the nursing home's residents and to detect if they have any deviated activity behavior. We propose a location-based deviated activity behavior detection system to detect deviated activity behavior by leveraging data fusion technique. In order to compute the features for data fusion, an adaptive method is applied for extracting the group and individual activity time and generate daily hybrid norm for each of the residents. Next, deviated activity behavior detection is executed by considering the difference between daily norm patterns and daily input data for each resident. Lastly, the deviated activity behavior among the residents are classified using a rule-based classification approach. Through the implementation, there are 44.4% of the residents do not have deviated activity behavior , while 37% residents involved in one deviated activity behavior and 18.6% residents have two or more deviated activity behaviors.

We propose a novel cross-input consistency-based self-supervised training strategy based on the idea that tracking can be performed using different inputs. Specifically, we construct two distinct inputs using unlabeled RGB-T video pairs. We then track objects using these two inputs to generate results, based on which we construct our cross-input consistency loss. Meanwhile, we propose a reweighting strategy to make our loss function robust to low-quality training samples. We build our tracker on a Siamese correlation filter network. To the best of our knowledge, our tracker is the first self-supervised RGB-T tracker. Extensive experiments on two public RGB-T tracking benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed training strategy is effective. Remarkably, despite training only with a corpus of unlabeled RGB-T video pairs, our tracker outperforms seven supervised RGB-T trackers on the GTOT dataset. ",

The reason underneath for such a study is the non-negligible importance of analyzing graph networks to partition the vertices by using the topological features of network graphs, solely.

For example, students may use LLMs to complete written assignments, leaving instructors unable to accurately assess student learning. In this paper, we first demonstrate that text sampled from an LLM tends to occupy negative curvature regions of the model's log probability function. Leveraging this observation, we then define a new curvature-based criterion for judging if a passage is generated from a given LLM. This approach, which we call DetectGPT, does not require training a separate classifier, collecting a dataset of real or generated passages, or explicitly watermarking generated text. It uses only log probabilities computed by the model of interest and random perturbations of the passage from another generic pre-trained language model (e.g, T5). We find DetectGPT is more discriminative than existing zero-shot methods for model sample detection, notably improving detection of fake news articles generated by 20B parameter GPT-NeoX from 0.81 AUROC for the strongest zero-shot baseline to 0.95 AUROC for DetectGPT.

NCDSSM employs auxiliary variables to disentangle recognition from dynamics, thus requiring amortized inference only for the auxiliary variables. Leveraging techniques from continuous-discrete filtering theory, we demonstrate how to perform accurate Bayesian inference for the dynamic states. We propose three flexible parameterizations of the latent dynamics and an efficient training objective that marginalizes the dynamic states during inference. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets across various domains show improved imputation and forecasting performance of NCDSSM over existing models. ",

Identifying signatures of new physics out of the enormous amount of data produced at the LHC falls into the class of anomaly detection and constitutes one of the greatest computational challenges.

Specifically, we train an energy-based model on a set of unlabelled protein-ligand complexes using SE(3) denoising score matching and interpret its log-likelihood as binding affinity. Our key contribution is a new equivariant rotation prediction network called Neural Euler's Rotation Equations (NERE) for SE(3) score matching. It predicts a rotation by modeling the force and torque between protein and ligand atoms, where the force is defined as the gradient of an energy function with respect to atom coordinates.

They reveal a node's function in the network, and facilitate our understanding of the network dynamics. For example, they can represent communities in social or citation networks, roles in corporate interactions, or core-periphery structures in transportation networks. We usually detect mesoscale structures under the assumption of independence of interactions. Still, in many cases, the interactions invalidate this assumption by occurring in a specific order. Such patterns emerge in pathway data; to capture them, we have to model the dependencies between interactions using higher-order network models. However, the detection of mesoscale structures in higher-order networks is still under-researched. In this work, we derive a Bayesian approach that simultaneously models the optimal partitioning of nodes in groups and the optimal higher-order network dynamics between the groups. In synthetic data we demonstrate that our method can recover both standard proximity-based communities and role-based groupings of nodes. In synthetic and real world data we show that it can compete with baseline techniques, while additionally providing interpretable abstractions of network dynamics. ",

    "title": "Smoothed Online Learning for Prediction in Piecewise Affine Systems",
    "abstract": "The problem of piecewise affine (PWA) regression and planning is of foundational importance to the study of online learning, control, and robotics, where it provides a theoretically and empirically tractable setting to study systems undergoing sharp changes in the dynamics. Unfortunately, due to the discontinuities that arise when crossing into different ``pieces,'' learning in general sequential settings is impossible and practical algorithms are forced to resort to heuristic approaches. This paper builds on the recently developed smoothed online learning framework and provides the first algorithms for prediction and simulation in PWA systems whose regret is polynomial in all relevant problem parameters under a weak smoothness assumption; moreover, our algorithms are efficient in the number of calls to an optimization oracle. We further apply our results to the problems of one-step prediction and multi-step simulation regret in piecewise affine dynamical systems, where the learner is tasked with simulating trajectories and regret is measured in terms of the Wasserstein distance between simulated and true data. Along the way, we develop several technical tools of more general interest. ",

    "title": "Improving Statistical Fidelity for Neural Image Compression with  Implicit Local Likelihood Models",
    "abstract": "Lossy image compression aims to represent images in as few bits as possible while maintaining fidelity to the original. Theoretical results indicate that optimizing distortion metrics such as PSNR or MS-SSIM necessarily leads to a discrepancy in the statistics of original images from those of reconstructions, in particular at low bitrates, often manifested by the blurring of the compressed images. Previous work has leveraged adversarial discriminators to improve statistical fidelity. Yet these binary discriminators adopted from generative modeling tasks may not be ideal for image compression. In this paper, we introduce a non-binary discriminator that is conditioned on quantized local image representations obtained via VQ-VAE autoencoders. Our evaluations on the CLIC2020, DIV2K and Kodak datasets show that our discriminator is more effective for jointly optimizing distortion (e.g., PSNR) and statistical fidelity (e.g., FID) than the state-of-the-art HiFiC model. On the CLIC2020 test set, we obtain the same FID as HiFiC with 30-40% fewer bits. ",

We show that the independences arising from the presence of collider structures in DAGs provide meaningful inductive biases, which constrain the regression hypothesis space and improve predictive performance. We introduce collider regression, a framework to incorporate probabilistic causal knowledge from a collider in a regression problem. When the hypothesis space is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we prove a strictly positive generalisation benefit under mild assumptions and provide closed-form estimators of the empirical risk minimiser. Experiments on synthetic and climate model data demonstrate performance gains of the proposed methodology. ",

These models tend to be lighter weight and require less training time than traditional RNN-based approaches. However, these models take frequentist approach to weight training. In theory, network weights are drawn from a latent, intractable probability distribution. We introduce BayesSpeech for end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition. BayesSpeech is a Bayesian Transformer Network where these intractable posteriors are learned through variational inference and the local reparameterization trick without recurrence. We show how the introduction of variance in the weights leads to faster training time and near state-of-the-art performance on LibriSpeech-960. ",
