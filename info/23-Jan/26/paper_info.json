    "title": "Lightweight Neural Architecture Search for Temporal Convolutional  Networks at the Edge",
    "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is quickly becoming the go-to approach to optimize the structure of Deep Learning (DL) models for complex tasks such as Image Classification or Object Detection. However, many other relevant applications of DL, especially at the edge, are based on time-series processing and require models with unique features, for which NAS is less explored. This work focuses in particular on Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), a convolutional model for time-series processing that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to more complex recurrent architectures. We propose the first NAS tool that explicitly targets the optimization of the most peculiar architectural parameters of TCNs, namely dilation, receptive-field and number of features in each layer. The proposed approach searches for networks that offer good trade-offs between accuracy and number of parameters/operations, enabling an efficient deployment on embedded platforms. We test the proposed NAS on four real-world, edge-relevant tasks, involving audio and bio-signals. Results show that, starting from a single seed network, our method is capable of obtaining a rich collection of Pareto optimal architectures, among which we obtain models with the same accuracy as the seed, and 15.9-152x fewer parameters. Compared to three state-of-the-art NAS tools, ProxylessNAS, MorphNet and FBNetV2, our method explores a larger search space for TCNs (up to 10^12x) and obtains superior solutions, while requiring low GPU memory and search time. We deploy our NAS outputs on two distinct edge devices, the multicore GreenWaves Technology GAP8 IoT processor and the single-core STMicroelectronics STM32H7 microcontroller. With respect to the state-of-the-art hand-tuned models, we reduce latency and energy of up to 5.5x and 3.8x on the two targets respectively, without any accuracy loss. ",

    "abstract": "Global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) are essential in providing localization and navigation services to most of the world due to their superior coverage. However, due to high pathloss and inevitable atmospheric effect, the positioning performance of any standalone GNSS is still poor in urban areas. To improve the positioning performance of legacy GNSSs in urban areas, a positioning system, which utilizes high altitude platform station (HAPS) and 5G gNodeBs (gNBs), in a futuristic urban vertical heterogeneous network (VHetNet) is proposed. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of gNBs in improving the vertical positioning accuracy for both the GPS-only system and the HAPS-aided GPS system by analyzing the impact of the density of gNBs and the pseudorange error of gNB on the positioning performance of the gNB augmented positioning systems. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) algorithms on the HAPS and/or gNB aided GPS systems in urban areas. ",

    "abstract": "Learning from the interaction is the primary way biological agents know about the environment and themselves. Modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) explores a computational approach to learning from interaction and has significantly progressed in solving various tasks. However, the powerful DRL is still far from biological agents in energy efficiency. Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, we believe that the integration of spiking communication between neurons and biologically-plausible synaptic plasticity plays a prominent role. Following this biological intuition, we optimize a spiking policy network (SPN) by a genetic algorithm as an energy-efficient alternative to DRL. Our SPN mimics the sensorimotor neuron pathway of insects and communicates through event-based spikes. Inspired by biological research that the brain forms memories by forming new synaptic connections and rewires these connections based on new experiences, we tune the synaptic connections instead of weights in SPN to solve given tasks. Experimental results on several robotic control tasks show that our method can achieve the performance level of mainstream DRL methods and exhibit significantly higher energy efficiency. ",

    "abstract": "Recent work on interpretability has focused on concept-based explanations, where deep learning models are explained in terms of high-level units of information, referred to as concepts. Concept learning models, however, have been shown to be prone to encoding impurities in their representations, failing to fully capture meaningful features of their inputs. While concept learning lacks metrics to measure such phenomena, the field of disentanglement learning has explored the related notion of underlying factors of variation in the data, with plenty of metrics to measure the purity of such factors. In this paper, we show that such metrics are not appropriate for concept learning and propose novel metrics for evaluating the purity of concept representations in both approaches. We show the advantage of these metrics over existing ones and demonstrate their utility in evaluating the robustness of concept representations and interventions performed on them. In addition, we show their utility for benchmarking state-of-the-art methods from both families and find that, contrary to common assumptions, supervision alone may not be sufficient for pure concept representations.

    "title": "SGCN: Exploiting Compressed-Sparse Features in Deep Graph Convolutional  Network Accelerators",
    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are becoming increasingly popular as they overcome the limited applicability of prior neural networks. A GCN takes as input an arbitrarily structured graph and executes a series of layers which exploit the graph's structure to calculate their output features. One recent trend in GCNs is the use of deep network architectures. As opposed to the traditional GCNs which only span around two to five layers deep, modern GCNs now incorporate tens to hundreds of layers with the help of residual connections. From such deep GCNs, we find an important characteristic that they exhibit very high intermediate feature sparsity. We observe that with deep layers and residual connections, the number of zeros in the intermediate features sharply increases. This reveals a new opportunity for accelerators to exploit in GCN executions that was previously not present. In this paper, we propose SGCN, a fast and energy-efficient GCN accelerator which fully exploits the sparse intermediate features of modern GCNs. SGCN suggests several techniques to achieve significantly higher performance and energy efficiency than the existing accelerators. First, SGCN employs a GCN-friendly feature compression format. We focus on reducing the off-chip memory traffic, which often is the bottleneck for GCN executions. Second, we propose microarchitectures for seamlessly handling the compressed feature format. Third, to better handle locality in the existence of the varying sparsity, SGCN employs sparsity-aware cooperation. Sparsity-aware cooperation creates a pattern that exhibits multiple reuse windows, such that the cache can capture diverse sizes of working sets and therefore adapt to the varying level of sparsity. We show that SGCN achieves 1.71x speedup and 43.9% higher energy efficiency compared to the existing accelerators. ",

    "abstract": "With the advancements in connected devices, a huge amount of real-time data is being generated. Efficient storage, transmission, and analysation of this real-time big data is important, as it serves a number of purposes ranging from decision making to fault prediction, etc. Alongside this, real-time big data has rigorous utility and privacy requirements, therefore, it is also significantly important to choose the handling strategies meticulously. One of the optimal way to store and transmit data in the form of lossless compression is Huffman coding, which compresses the data into a variable length binary stream. Similarly, in order to protect the privacy of such big data, differential privacy is being used nowadays, which perturbs the data on the basis of privacy budget and sensitivity. Nevertheless, traditional differential privacy mechanisms provide privacy guarantees. However, on the other hand, real-time data cannot be dealt as an ordinary set of records, because it usually has certain underlying patterns and cycles, which can be used for forming a link to a specific individuals private information that can lead to severe privacy leakages (e.g., analysing smart metering data can lead to classification of individuals daily routine). Thus, it is equally important to develop a privacy preservation model, which preserves the privacy on the basis of occurrences and patterns in the data. In this paper, we design a novel Huff-DP mechanism, which selects the optimal privacy budget on the basis of privacy requirement for that specific record. In order to further enhance the budget determination, we propose static, sine, and fuzzy logic based decision algorithms. From the experimental evaluations, it can be concluded that our proposed Huff-DP mechanism provides effective privacy protection alongside reducing the privacy budget computational cost. ",

However, language model-based KG embeddings are usually deployed as static artifacts, which are challenging to modify without re-training after deployment. To address this issue, we propose a new task of editing language model-based KG embeddings in this paper. The proposed task aims to enable data-efficient and fast updates to KG embeddings without damaging the performance of the rest. We build four new datasets: E-FB15k237, A-FB15k237, E-WN18RR, and A-WN18RR, and evaluate several knowledge editing baselines demonstrating the limited ability of previous models to handle the proposed challenging task. We further propose a simple yet strong baseline dubbed KGEditor, which utilizes additional parametric layers of the hyper network to edit/add facts. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that KGEditor can perform better when updating specific facts while not affecting the rest with low training resources.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) and natural language processing (NLP) systems have developed rapidly and have been widely used in various real-world fields. However, they have been shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Specifically, the adversary injects a backdoor into the model during the training phase, so that input samples with backdoor triggers are classified as the target class. Some attacks have achieved high attack success rates on the pre-trained language models (LMs), but there have yet to be effective defense methods. In this work, we propose a defense method based on deep model mutation testing. Our main justification is that backdoor samples are much more robust than clean samples if we impose random mutations on the LMs and that backdoors are generalizable. We first confirm the effectiveness of model mutation testing in detecting backdoor samples and select the most appropriate mutation operators. We then systematically defend against three extensively studied backdoor attack levels (i.e., char-level, word-level, and sentence-level) by detecting backdoor samples. We also make the first attempt to defend against the latest style-level backdoor attacks. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets (i.e., IMDB, Yelp, and AG news) and three style transfer datasets (i.e., SST-2, Hate-speech, and AG news). The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach can detect backdoor samples more efficiently and accurately than the three state-of-the-art defense approaches. ",

    "abstract": "In the surface defect detection, there are some suspicious regions that cannot be uniquely classified as abnormal or normal. The annotating of suspicious regions is easily affected by factors such as workers' emotional fluctuations and judgment standard, resulting in noisy labels, which in turn leads to missing and false detections, and ultimately leads to inconsistent judgments of product quality. Unlike the usual noisy labels, the ones used for surface defect detection appear to be inconsistent rather than mislabeled. The noise occurs in almost every label and is difficult to correct or evaluate. In this paper, we proposed a framework that learns trustworthy models from noisy labels for surface defect defection. At first, to avoid the negative impact of noisy labels on the model, we represent the suspicious regions with consistent and precise elements at the pixel-level and redesign the loss function. Secondly, without changing network structure and adding any extra labels, pluggable spatially correlated Bayesian module is proposed. Finally, the defect discrimination confidence is proposed to measure the uncertainty, with which anomalies can be identified as defects. Our results indicate not only the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning from noisy labels, but also robustness and real-time performance. ",

However, they are also expensive, due to the need to encode a large number of retrieved passages. Some work avoids this cost by pre-encoding a text corpus into a memory and retrieving dense representations directly. However, pre-encoding memory incurs a severe quality penalty as the memory representations are not conditioned on the current input. We propose LUMEN, a hybrid between these two extremes, pre-computing the majority of the retrieval representation and completing the encoding on the fly using a live encoder that is conditioned on the question and fine-tuned for the task. We show that LUMEN significantly outperforms pure memory on multiple question-answering tasks while being much cheaper than FiD, and outperforms both for any given compute budget. Moreover, the advantage of LUMEN over FiD increases with model size. ",

The most effective solution for this problem is adversarial training that trains the model with adversarially perturbed samples instead of original ones. Various methods have been developed over recent years to improve adversarial training such as data augmentation or modifying training attacks. In this work, we examine the same problem from a new data-centric perspective. For this purpose, we first demonstrate that the existing model-based methods can be equivalent to applying smaller perturbation or optimization weights to the hard training examples. By using this finding, we propose detecting and removing these hard samples directly from the training procedure rather than applying complicated algorithms to mitigate their effects. For detection, we use maximum softmax probability as an effective method in out-of-distribution detection since we can consider the hard samples as the out-of-distribution samples for the whole data distribution. Our results on SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets show the effectiveness of this method in improving the adversarial training without adding too much computational cost. ",

Recently, Graph Neural CAs (GNCAs) have been proposed as models built on top of standard GNNs that can be trained to approximate the transition rule of any arbitrary GCA. Existing GNCAs are anisotropic in the sense that their transition rules are not equivariant to translation, rotation, and reflection of the nodes' spatial locations. However, it is desirable for instances related by such transformations to be treated identically by the model. By replacing standard graph convolutions with E(n)-equivariant ones, we avoid anisotropy by design and propose a class of isotropic automata that we call E(n)-GNCAs. These models are lightweight, but can nevertheless handle large graphs, capture complex dynamics and exhibit emergent self-organising behaviours. We showcase the broad and successful applicability of E(n)-GNCAs on three different tasks: (i) pattern formation, (ii) graph auto-encoding, and (iii) simulation of E(n)-equivariant dynamical systems.

    "abstract": "Every attack begins with gathering information about the target. The entry point for network breaches are often vulnerabilities in internet facing websites, which often rely on an off-the-shelf Content Management System (CMS). Bot networks and human attackers alike rely on automated scanners to gather information about the CMS software installed and potential vulnerabilities. To increase the security of websites using a CMS, it is desirable to make the use of CMS scanners less reliable. The aim of this work is to extend the current knowledge about cyber deception in regard to CMS. To demonstrate this, a WordPress Plugin called 'SCANTRAP' was created, which uses simulation and dissimulation in regards to plugins, themes, versions, and users. We found that the resulting plugin is capable of obfuscating real information and to a certain extent inject false information to the output of one of the most popular WordPress scanners, WPScan, without limiting the legitimate functionality of the WordPress installation.

    "abstract": "A temporal graph has an edge set that may change over discrete time steps, and a temporal path (or walk) must traverse edges that appear at increasing time steps. Accordingly, two temporal paths (or walks) are temporally disjoint if they do not visit any vertex at the same time. The study of the computational complexity of finding temporally disjoint paths or walks in temporal graphs has recently been initiated by Klobas et al. [IJCAI '21]. This problem is motivated by applications in multi-agent path finding (MAPF), which include robotics, warehouse management, aircraft management, and traffic routing. We extend Klobas et al.'s research by providing parameterized hardness results for very restricted cases, with a focus on structural parameters of the so-called underlying graph. On the positive side, we identify sufficiently simple cases where we can solve the problem efficiently. Our results reveal some surprising differences between the \"path version\" and the \"walk version\" (where vertices may be visited multiple times) of the problem, and answer several open questions posed by Klobas et al.

Clinicians have to deal with an enormous amount of unstructured textual data to make a conclusion about patients' health in their everyday life. Argument mining helps to provide a structure to such data by detecting argumentative components in the text and classifying the relations between them. However, as it is the case for many tasks in Natural Language Processing in general and in medical text processing in particular, the large majority of the work on computational argumentation has been done only for English. This is also the case with the only dataset available for argumentation in the medical domain, namely, the annotated medical data of abstracts of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) from the MEDLINE database. In order to mitigate the lack of annotated data for other languages, we empirically investigate several strategies to perform argument mining and classification in medical texts for a language for which no annotated data is available. This project shows that automatically translating and project annotations from English to a target language (Spanish) is an effective way to generate annotated data without manual intervention. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the translation and projection approach outperforms zero-shot cross-lingual approaches using a large masked multilingual language model. Finally, we show how the automatically generated data in Spanish can also be used to improve results in the original English evaluation setting. ",

Many of the proposed tooth mesh segmentation algorithms summarize the mesh cell as - the cell center or barycenter, the normal at barycenter, the cell vertices and the normals at the cell vertices. Summarizing of the mesh cell/triangle in this manner imposes an implicit structural constraint and makes it difficult to work with multiple resolutions which is done in many point cloud based deep learning algorithms. We propose a novel segmentation method which utilizes only the barycenter and the normal at the barycenter information of the mesh cell and yet achieves competitive performance.

    "abstract": "Recently, graph-based models designed for downstream tasks have significantly advanced research on graph neural networks (GNNs). GNN baselines based on neural message-passing mechanisms such as GCN and GAT perform worse as the network deepens. Therefore, numerous GNN variants have been proposed to tackle this performance degradation problem, including many deep GNNs. However, a unified framework is still lacking to connect these existing models and interpret their effectiveness at a high level. In this work, we focus on deep GNNs and propose a novel view for understanding them. We establish a theoretical framework via inference on a probabilistic graphical model. Given the fixed point equation (FPE) derived from the variational inference on the Markov random fields, the deep GNNs, including JKNet, GCNII, DGCN, and the classical GNNs, such as GCN, GAT, and APPNP, can be regarded as different approximations of the FPE. Moreover, given this framework, more accurate approximations of FPE are brought, guiding us to design a more powerful GNN: coupling graph neural network (CoGNet). Extensive experiments are carried out on citation networks and natural language processing downstream tasks. The results demonstrate that the CoGNet outperforms the SOTA models. ",

Nevertheless, those models may be brittle when faced to typos, distribution shifts or vulnerable to malicious attacks.

Usual approaches include synonyms replacements or typos injections -- as data-augmentation -- and the use of more robust tokenizers (characterBERT, BPE-dropout). To further complement the literature, we investigate in this paper adversarial training as another possible solution to this robustness issue. Our comparison includes the two main families of BERT-based neural retrievers, i.e. dense and sparse, with and without distillation techniques. We then demonstrate that one of the most simple adversarial training techniques -- the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) -- can improve first stage rankers robustness and effectiveness. In particular, FGSM increases models performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain distributions, and also on queries with typos, for multiple neural retrievers. ",

With the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in the world, SARS-CoV-2 has mutated into various variants. Given the increasingly dangerous conditions of the pandemic, it is crucial to know when the pandemic will stop by predicting confirmed cases of COVID-19. Therefore, many studies have raised COVID-19 as a case study to overcome the ongoing pandemic using the Deep Learning method, namely LSTM, with reasonably accurate results and small error values. LSTM training is used to predict confirmed cases of COVID-19 based on variants that have been identified using ECDC's COVID-19 dataset containing confirmed cases of COVID-19 that have been identified from 30 countries in Europe. Tests were conducted using the LSTM and BiLSTM models with the addition of RNN as comparisons on hidden size and layer size.

We examine an anomaly detection protocol for cyber-attacks that seek to leverage spot prices for financial gain. In this way we outline a methodology for detecting attacks on industrial load smart meters. We first create a feature clustering model of the underlying business, segregated by business type. We then use these clusters to create an incentive-weighted anomaly detection protocol for false data attacks against load profiles. This clustering-based methodology incorporates both the load profile and spot pricing considerations for the detection of injected load profiles. To reduce false positives, we model incentive-based detection, which includes knowledge of spot prices, into the anomaly tracking, enabling the methodology to account for changes in the load profile which are unlikely to be attacks.

Starting from the well-known example of honeypots, many other deception strategies have been developed such as honeytokens and moving target defense, all sharing the objective of creating uncertainty for attackers and increasing the chance for the attacker of making mistakes. In this paper a methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of honeypots and moving target defense in a network is presented. This methodology allows to quantitatively measure the effectiveness in a simulation environment, allowing to make recommendations on how many honeypots to deploy and on how quickly network addresses have to be mutated to effectively disrupt an attack in multiple network and attacker configurations. With this optimum, attacks can be detected and slowed down with a minimal resource and configuration overhead. With the provided methodology, the optimal number of honeypots to be deployed and the optimal network address mutation interval can be determined. Furthermore, this work provides guidance on how to optimally deploy and configure them with respect to the attacker model and several network parameters. ",

To quantify how well an inferred graph can explain a trace, we introduce feasibility, a novel quality criterion, and suggest that it is linked to the result's accuracy. In addition, we propose CEM-*, a network inference method that guarantees 100% feasibility given online social media traces, which is a non-trivial extension of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm developed by Newman (2018). We propose a set of linear optimization updates that incorporate a set of auxiliary variables and a set of feasibility constraints; the latter takes into consideration all the hidden paths that are possible between users based on their timestamps of interaction and guide the inference toward feasibility. We provide two CEM-* variations, that assume either an Erdos Renyi (ER) or a Stochastic Block Model (SBM) prior for the underlying graph's unknown distribution. Extensive experiments on one synthetic and one real-world Twitter dataset show that for both priors CEM-* can generate a posterior distribution of graphs that explains the whole trace while being closer to the ground truth. As an additional benefit, the use of the SBM prior infers and clusters users simultaneously during optimization. CEM-* outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art methods in terms of feasibility, run-time, and precision of the inferred graph and communities. Finally, we propose a heuristic to adapt the inference to lower feasibility requirements and show how it can affect the precision of the result. ",

Recognition is made possible by letting the robot alternately search for objects and assign found objects to scenes. Our scene model \"Implicit Shape Model (ISM) trees\" allows us to solve these two tasks together. For the ISM trees, this article presents novel algorithms for recognizing scenes and predicting the poses of searched objects. We define scenes as sets of objects, where some objects are connected by 3-D spatial relations. In previous work, we recognized scenes using single ISMs. However, these ISMs were prone to false positives. To address this problem, we introduced ISM trees, a hierarchical model that includes multiple ISMs. Through the recognition algorithm it contributes, this article ultimately enables the use of ISM trees in scene recognition. We intend to enable users to generate ISM trees from object arrangements demonstrated by humans. The lack of a suitable algorithm is overcome by the introduction of an ISM tree generation algorithm. In scene recognition, it is usually assumed that image data is already available. However, this is not always the case for robots. For this reason, we combined scene recognition and object search in previous work. However, we did not provide an efficient algorithm to link the two tasks. This article introduces such an algorithm that predicts the poses of searched objects with relations. Experiments show that our overall approach enables robots to find and recognize object arrangements that cannot be perceived from a single viewpoint. ",

For this reason, anomaly detection applied to monitoring data such as logs allows gaining relevant insights to improve IT services steadily and eradicate failures.

Therefore, we propose PULL, an iterative log analysis method for reactive anomaly detection based on estimated failure time windows provided by monitoring systems instead of labeled data. Our attention-based model uses a novel objective function for weak supervision deep learning that accounts for imbalanced data and applies an iterative learning strategy for positive and unknown samples (PU learning) to identify anomalous logs. Our evaluation shows that PULL consistently outperforms ten benchmark baselines across three different datasets and detects anomalous log messages with an F1-score of more than 0.99 even within imprecise failure time windows.

Given the safety requirements associated with operating in proximity to humans and expensive infrastructure, it is important to understand and mitigate the security vulnerabilities of such systems caused by compromised robots who diverge from their assigned plans. We focus on centralized systems, where a *central entity* (CE) is responsible for determining and transmitting the motion plans to the robots, which report their location as they move following the plan. The CE checks that robots follow their assigned plans by comparing their expected location to the location they self-report. We show that this self-reporting monitoring mechanism is vulnerable to *plan-deviation attacks* where compromised robots don't follow their assigned plans while trying to conceal their movement by mis-reporting their location. We propose a two-pronged mitigation for plan-deviation attacks: (1) an attack detection technique leveraging both the robots' local sensing capabilities to report observations of other robots and *co-observation schedules* generated by the CE, and (2) a prevention technique where the CE issues *horizon-limiting announcements* to the robots, reducing their instantaneous knowledge of forward lookahead steps in the global motion plan. On a large-scale automated warehouse benchmark, we show that our solution enables attack prevention guarantees from a stealthy attacker that has compromised multiple robots. ",

    "abstract": "The growth of large, programatically accessible bibliometrics databases presents new opportunities for complex analyses of publication metadata. In addition to providing a wealth of information about authors and institutions, databases such as those provided by Dimensions also provide conceptual information and links to entities such as grants, funders and patents. However, data is not the only challenge in evaluating patterns in scholarly work: These large datasets can be challenging to integrate, particularly for those unfamiliar with the complex schemas necessary for accommodating such heterogeneous information, and those most comfortable with data mining may not be as experienced in data visualisation. Here, we present an open-source Python library that streamlines the process accessing and diagramming subsets of the Dimensions on Google BigQuery database and demonstrate its use on the freely available Dimensions COVID-19 dataset. We are optimistic that this tool will expand access to this valuable information by streamlining what would otherwise be multiple complex technical tasks, enabling more researchers to examine patterns in research focus and collaboration over time.

    "abstract": "We present a convolutional framework which significantly reduces the complexity and thus, the computational effort for distributed reinforcement learning control of dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Exploiting translational invariances, the high-dimensional distributed control problem can be transformed into a multi-agent control problem with many identical, uncoupled agents. Furthermore, using the fact that information is transported with finite velocity in many cases, the dimension of the agents' environment can be drastically reduced using a convolution operation over the state space of the PDE. In this setting, the complexity can be flexibly adjusted via the kernel width or by using a stride greater than one. Moreover, scaling from smaller to larger systems -- or the transfer between different domains -- becomes a straightforward task requiring little effort. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework using several PDE examples with increasing complexity, where stabilization is achieved by training a low-dimensional deep deterministic policy gradient agent using minimal computing resources.

    "abstract": "Machine and deep learning algorithms have increasingly been applied to solve problems in various areas of knowledge. Among these areas, Chemometrics has been benefited from the application of these algorithms in spectral data analysis. Commonly, algorithms such as Support Vector Machines and Partial Least Squares are applied to spectral datasets to perform classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we present a 1D convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) to evaluate the effectiveness on spectral data obtained from spectroscopy. In most cases, the spectrum signals are noisy and present overlap among classes. Firstly, we perform extensive experiments including 1D-CNN compared to machine learning algorithms and standard algorithms used in Chemometrics on spectral data classification for the most known datasets available in the literature. Next, spectral samples of the SARS-COV2 virus, which causes the COVID-19, have recently been collected via spectroscopy was used as a case study. Experimental results indicate superior performance of 1D-CNN over machine learning algorithms and standard algorithms, obtaining an average accuracy of 96.5%, specificity of 98%, and sensitivity of 94%. The promissing obtained results indicate the feasibility to use 1D-CNN in automated systems to diagnose COVID-19 and other viral diseases in the future. ",

However, the robustness of these methods to adversarial attacks has not been thoroughly examined. In this study, we conduct the first comprehensive investigation of the robustness of leading camera-based 3D object detection methods under various adversarial conditions. Our experiments reveal five interesting findings: (a) the use of accurate depth estimation effectively improves robustness; (b) depth-estimation-free approaches do not show superior robustness; (c) bird's-eye-view-based representations exhibit greater robustness against localization attacks; (d) incorporating multi-frame benign inputs can effectively mitigate adversarial attacks; and (e) addressing long-tail problems can enhance robustness. We hope our work can provide guidance for the design of future camera-based object detection modules with improved adversarial robustness. ",

Our proposed method leverages a ray-tracing-based neural rendering for novel view US synthesis. Recent publications demonstrated that INR models could encode a representation of a three-dimensional scene from a set of two-dimensional US frames. However, these models fail to consider the view-dependent changes in appearance and geometry intrinsic to US imaging. In our work, we discuss direction-dependent changes in the scene and show that a physics-inspired rendering improves the fidelity of US image synthesis. In particular, we demonstrate experimentally that our proposed method generates geometrically accurate B-mode images for regions with ambiguous representation owing to view-dependent differences of the US images. We conduct our experiments using simulated B-mode US sweeps of the liver and acquired US sweeps of a spine phantom tracked with a robotic arm. The experiments corroborate that our method generates US frames that enable consistent volume compounding from previously unseen views. To the best of our knowledge, the presented work is the first to address view-dependent US image synthesis using INR. ",

In this work, we investigate the benefits of a curricular Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) pretraining scheme with respect to fully-supervised training regimes for pneumonia recognition on Chest X-Ray images of Covid-19 patients. We show that curricular SSL pretraining, which leverages unlabeled data, outperforms models trained from scratch, or pretrained on ImageNet, indicating the potential of performance gains by SSL pretraining on massive unlabeled datasets. Finally, we demonstrate that top-performing SSLpretrained models show a higher degree of attention in the lung regions, embodying models that may be more robust to possible external confounding factors in the training datasets, identified by previous works.

    "abstract": "The depth of knowledge offered by post-genomic medicine has carried the promise of new drugs, and cures for multiple diseases. To explore the degree to which this capability has materialized, we extract meta-data from 356,403 clinical trials spanning four decades, aiming to offer mechanistic insights into the innovation practices in drug discovery. We find that convention dominates over innovation, as over 96% of the recorded trials focus on previously tested drug targets, and the tested drugs target only 12% of the human interactome. If current patterns persist, it would take 170 years to target all druggable proteins. We uncover two network-based fundamental mechanisms that currently limit target discovery: preferential attachment, leading to the repeated exploration of previously targeted proteins; and local network effects, limiting exploration to proteins interacting with highly explored proteins. We build on these insights to develop a quantitative network-based model of drug discovery. We demonstrate that the model is able to accurately recreate the exploration patterns observed in clinical trials. Most importantly, we show that a network-based search strategy can widen the scope of drug discovery by guiding exploration to novel proteins that are part of under explored regions in the human interactome.
