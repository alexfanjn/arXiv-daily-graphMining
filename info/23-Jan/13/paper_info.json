    "title": "Learning Continuous Mesh Representation with Spherical Implicit Surface",
    "abstract": "As the most common representation for 3D shapes, mesh is often stored discretely with arrays of vertices and faces. However, 3D shapes in the real world are presented continuously. In this paper, we propose to learn a continuous representation for meshes with fixed topology, a common and practical setting in many faces-, hand-, and body-related applications. First, we split the template into multiple closed manifold genus-0 meshes so that each genus-0 mesh can be parameterized onto the unit sphere. Then we learn spherical implicit surface (SIS), which takes a spherical coordinate and a global feature or a set of local features around the coordinate as inputs, predicting the vertex corresponding to the coordinate as an output. Since the spherical coordinates are continuous, SIS can depict a mesh in an arbitrary resolution. SIS representation builds a bridge between discrete and continuous representation in 3D shapes. Specifically, we train SIS networks in a self-supervised manner for two tasks: a reconstruction task and a super-resolution task. Experiments show that our SIS representation is comparable with state-of-the-art methods that are specifically designed for meshes with a fixed resolution and significantly outperforms methods that work in arbitrary resolutions.

    "abstract": "Network slicing is a crucial enabler to support the composition and deployment of virtual network infrastructures required by the dynamic behavior of networks like 5G/6G mobile networks, IoT-aware networks, e-health systems, and industry verticals like the internet of vehicles (IoV) and industry 4.0. The communication slices and their allocated communication resources are essential in slicing architectures for resource orchestration and allocation, virtual network function (VNF) deployment, and slice operation functionalities. The communication slices provide the communications capabilities required to support slice operation, SLA guarantees, and QoS/ QoE application requirements. Therefore, this contribution proposes a networking slicing conceptual model to formulate the optimization problem related to the sharing of communication resources among communication slices. First, we present a conceptual model of network slicing, we then formulate analytically some aspects of the model and the optimization problem to address. Next, we proposed to use a SARSA agent to solve the problem and implement a proof of concept prototype. Finally, we present the obtained results and discuss them. ",

We argue that the theory of causal abstraction provides the mathematical foundations for the desired kinds of model explanations. In causal abstraction analysis, we use interventions on model-internal states to rigorously assess whether an interpretable high-level causal model is a faithful description of an AI model. Our contributions in this area are: (1) We generalize causal abstraction to cyclic causal structures and typed high-level variables. (2) We show how multi-source interchange interventions can be used to conduct causal abstraction analyses. (3) We define a notion of approximate causal abstraction that allows us to assess the degree to which a high-level causal model is a causal abstraction of a lower-level one. (4) We prove constructive causal abstraction can be decomposed into three operations we refer to as marginalization, variable-merge, and value-merge. (5) We formalize the XAI methods of LIME, causal effect estimation, causal mediation analysis, iterated nullspace projection, and circuit-based explanations as special cases of causal abstraction analysis.

    "abstract": "Semantic labeling of coronary arterial segments in invasive coronary angiography (ICA) is important for automated assessment and report generation of coronary artery stenosis in the computer-aided diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Inspired by the training procedure of interventional cardiologists for interpreting the structure of coronary arteries, we propose an association graph-based graph matching network (AGMN) for coronary arterial semantic labeling. We first extract the vascular tree from invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and convert it into multiple individual graphs. Then, an association graph is constructed from two individual graphs where each vertex represents the relationship between two arterial segments. Using the association graph, the AGMN extracts the vertex features by the embedding module, aggregates the features from adjacent vertices and edges by graph convolution network, and decodes the features to generate the semantic mappings between arteries. By learning the mapping of arterial branches between two individual graphs, the unlabeled arterial segments are classified by the labeled segments to achieve semantic labeling. A dataset containing 263 ICAs was employed to train and validate the proposed model, and a five-fold cross-validation scheme was performed. Our AGMN model achieved an average accuracy of 0.8264, an average precision of 0.8276, an average recall of 0.8264, and an average F1-score of 0.8262, which significantly outperformed existing coronary artery semantic labeling methods. In conclusion, we have developed and validated a new algorithm with high accuracy, interpretability, and robustness for coronary artery semantic labeling on ICAs. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial training has been considered an imperative component for safely deploying neural network-based applications to the real world. To achieve stronger robustness, existing methods primarily focus on how to generate strong attacks by increasing the number of update steps, regularizing the models with the smoothed loss function, and injecting the randomness into the attack. Instead, we analyze the behavior of adversarial training through the lens of response frequency. We empirically discover that adversarial training causes neural networks to have low convergence to high-frequency information, resulting in highly oscillated predictions near each data. To learn high-frequency contents efficiently and effectively, we first prove that a universal phenomenon of frequency principle, i.e., \\textit{lower frequencies are learned first}, still holds in adversarial training. Based on that, we propose phase-shifted adversarial training (PhaseAT) in which the model learns high-frequency components by shifting these frequencies to the low-frequency range where the fast convergence occurs. For evaluations, we conduct the experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with the adaptive attack carefully designed for reliable evaluation. Comprehensive results show that PhaseAT significantly improves the convergence for high-frequency information. This results in improved adversarial robustness by enabling the model to have smoothed predictions near each data. ",

However, labeled training data for real-world applications such as healthcare is limited and difficult to access given longstanding privacy, and strict data sharing policies. By manipulating image datasets in the pixel or feature space, existing data augmentation techniques represent one of the effective ways to improve the quantity and diversity of training data. Here, we look to advance augmentation techniques by building upon the emerging success of text-to-image diffusion probabilistic models in augmenting the training samples of our macroscopic skin disease dataset. We do so by enabling fine-grained control of the image generation process via input text prompts. We demonstrate that this generative data augmentation approach successfully maintains a similar classification accuracy of the visual classifier even when trained on a fully synthetic skin disease dataset. Similar to recent applications of generative models, our study suggests that diffusion models are indeed effective in generating high-quality skin images that do not sacrifice the classifier performance, and can improve the augmentation of training datasets after curation.

Traditional structural measures in Network Science focus on the analysis and modelling of complex networks from the perspective of network structure, such as the centrality measures, the clustering coefficient, and motifs and graphlets, and they have become basic tools for studying and understanding graphs. In comparison, graph neural networks, especially graph convolutional networks (GCNs), are particularly effective at integrating node features into graph structures via neighbourhood aggregation and message passing, and have been shown to significantly improve the performances in a variety of learning tasks. These two classes of methods are, however, typically treated separately with limited references to each other. In this work, aiming to establish relationships between them, we provide a network science perspective of GCNs. Our novel taxonomy classifies GCNs from three structural information angles, i.e., the layer-wise message aggregation scope, the message content, and the overall learning scope. Moreover, as a prerequisite for reviewing GCNs via a network science perspective, we also summarise traditional structural measures and propose a new taxonomy for them. Finally and most importantly, we draw connections between traditional structural approaches and graph convolutional networks, and discuss potential directions for future research. ",

    "abstract": "Time series classification is an important data mining task that has received a lot of interest in the past two decades. Due to the label scarcity in practice, semi-supervised time series classification with only a few labeled samples has become popular. Recently, Similarity-aware Time Series Classification (SimTSC) is proposed to address this problem by using a graph neural network classification model on the graph generated from pairwise Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance of batch data. It shows excellent accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in several few-label settings. However, since SimTSC relies on pairwise DTW distances, the quadratic complexity of DTW limits its usability to only reasonably sized datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a new efficient semi-supervised time series classification technique, LB-SimTSC, with a new graph construction module. Instead of using DTW, we propose to utilize a lower bound of DTW, LB_Keogh, to approximate the dissimilarity between instances in linear time, while retaining the relative proximity relationships one would have obtained via computing DTW. We construct the pairwise distance matrix using LB_Keogh and build a graph for the graph neural network. We apply this approach to the ten largest datasets from the well-known UCR time series classification archive. The results demonstrate that this approach can be up to 104x faster than SimTSC when constructing the graph on large datasets without significantly decreasing classification accuracy. ",

This study proposes a novel neural network architecture for early T2DM prediction using multi-headed self-attention and dense layers to extract features from historic diagnoses, patient vitals, and demographics. The proposed technique is called the Self-Attention for Comorbid Disease Net (SACDNet), achieving an accuracy of 89.3% and an F1-Score of 89.1%, having a 1.6% increased accuracy and 1.3% increased f1-score compared to the baseline techniques. Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is applied to the SACEDNet to get a bayesian approximation. A T2DM prediction framework based on the MC Dropout SACDNet is proposed to quantize the uncertainty associated with the predictions. A T2DM prediction dataset is also built as part of this study which is based on real-world routine Electronic Health Record (EHR) data comprising 4,124 diabetic and 181,767 non-diabetic examples, collected from 295 different EHR systems running in different parts of the United States of America. This dataset is further used to evaluate 7 different machine learning and 3 deep learning-based models. Finally, a detailed analysis of the fairness of every technique against different patient demographic groups is performed to validate the unbiased generalization of the techniques and the diversity of the data.

Modeling target distribution at arbitrary quantile levels and at arbitrary input attribute levels are important to offer a comprehensive picture of the data, and requires the quantile function to be expressive enough. The quantile function describing the target distribution using quantile levels is critical for quantile regression. Although various parametric forms for the distributions (that the quantile function specifies) can be adopted, an everlasting problem is selecting the most appropriate one that can properly approximate the data distributions. In this paper, we propose a non-parametric and data-driven approach, Neural Spline Search (NSS), to represent the observed data distribution without parametric assumptions. NSS is flexible and expressive for modeling data distributions by transforming the inputs with a series of monotonic spline regressions guided by symbolic operators. We demonstrate that NSS outperforms previous methods on synthetic, real-world regression and time-series forecasting tasks. ",

Among them, the differential Laplican regularizer can effectively alleviate the implicit surface unsmoothness caused by the point cloud quality deteriorates; Meanwhile, in order to reduce the excessive smoothing at the edge regions of implicit suface, we proposed a dynamic edge extract strategy for sampling near the sharp edge of point cloud, which can effectively avoid the Laplacian regularizer from smoothing all regions. Finally, we combine them with a simple regularization term for robust implicit surface reconstruction. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, experimental results show that our method significantly improves the quality of 3D reconstruction results.

However, existing CNN based methods rely heavily on massive manual annotations, which are very expensive and require huge human resources. In this work, we adopt a coarse-to-fine strategy and propose a self-supervised correction learning paradigm for semi-supervised biomedical image segmentation. Specifically, we design a dual-task network, including a shared encoder and two independent decoders for segmentation and lesion region inpainting, respectively. In the first phase, only the segmentation branch is used to obtain a relatively rough segmentation result. In the second step, we mask the detected lesion regions on the original image based on the initial segmentation map, and send it together with the original image into the network again to simultaneously perform inpainting and segmentation separately. For labeled data, this process is supervised by the segmentation annotations, and for unlabeled data, it is guided by the inpainting loss of masked lesion regions. Since the two tasks rely on similar feature information, the unlabeled data effectively enhances the representation of the network to the lesion regions and further improves the segmentation performance. Moreover, a gated feature fusion (GFF) module is designed to incorporate the complementary features from the two tasks. Experiments on three medical image segmentation datasets for different tasks including polyp, skin lesion and fundus optic disc segmentation well demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method compared with other semi-supervised approaches.

The problem has become challenging as (i) a user typically does not know what datasets exist in an enormous data repository; and (ii) there is usually a lack of a unified data model to capture the interrelationships between heterogeneous datasets from disparate sources. The common practice in production is to provide a keyword search interface over the metadata of datasets but users often have discovery needs that cannot be precisely expressed by keywords. In this work, we address one important class of discovery needs: finding union-able tables. The task is to find tables in the repository (or on the web) that can be unioned with a given query table. The challenge is to recognize union-able columns that may be represented differently. In this paper, we propose a data-driven learning approach: specifically, an unsupervised representation learning and embedding retrieval task. Our key idea is to exploit self-supervised contrastive learning to learn an embedding model that produces close embeddings for columns with semantically similar values while pushing apart columns with semantically dissimilar values. We then find union-able tables based on similarities between their constituent columns in embedding space. On a real-world dataset, we demonstrate that our best-performing model achieves significant improvements in precision ($16\\% \\uparrow$), recall ($17\\% \\uparrow $), and query response time (7x faster) compared to the state-of-the-art.

We establish the convergence of SFP to Quantal Response Equilibria in different classes of games capturing both network competition as well as network coordination. We also prove that the beliefs will eventually homogenize in all network games. Although the initial belief heterogeneity disappears in the limit, we show that it plays a crucial role for equilibrium selection in the case of coordination games as it helps select highly desirable equilibria. Contrary, in the case of network competition, the resulting limit behavior is independent of the initialization of beliefs, even when the underlying game has many distinct Nash equilibria. ",

    "abstract": "Crowd analysis from drones has attracted increasing attention in recent times due to the ease of use and affordable cost of these devices. However, how this technology can provide a solution to crowd flow detection is still an unexplored research question. To this end, we propose a crowd flow detection method for video sequences shot by a drone. The method is based on a fully-convolutional network that learns to perform crowd clustering in order to detect the centroids of crowd-dense areas and track their movement in consecutive frames. The proposed method proved effective and efficient when tested on the Crowd Counting datasets of the VisDrone challenge, characterized by video sequences rather than still images. The encouraging results show that the proposed method could open up new ways of analyzing high-level crowd behavior from drones. ",

    "abstract": "TikTok is a relatively novel and widely popular media platform. In response to its expanding user base and cultural impact, researchers are turning to study the platform; however, TikTok, like many social media platforms, restricts external access to data. Prior works have acquired data from scraping the platform, user self-reports, and from accounts created by researchers for the study's purpose. Existing techniques, while yielding important insights, contain limitations for gathering large-scale quantitative insights on how real TikTok users behave on the platform. We bridge this research gap by implementing a data donation system to collect TikTok data. Our system leverages users' right to access their data enabled by the EU's GDPR regulation. We recruit 347 TikTok users, ask them to request their data from TikTok, and then use our system to customize, anonymize, and donate their data. We collect 4.9M videos viewed 9.2M times by our participants -- and associated engagement metrics -- to analyze how people consume content on TikTok, how prevalent liking behavior is on TikTok, and whether there are substantial differences across our participants' demographics. We conclude our work by discussing the lessons learned and future avenues for implementing data donation systems, which we believe offer a promising avenue for collecting user behavioral traces to understand social phenomena through the lens of the Web.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning is highly useful in common scenarios where labeled data is scarce but unlabeled data is abundant. The graph (or nonlocal) Laplacian is a fundamental smoothing operator for solving various learning tasks. For unsupervised clustering, a spectral embedding is often used, based on graph-Laplacian eigenvectors. For semi-supervised problems, the common approach is to solve a constrained optimization problem, regularized by a Dirichlet energy, based on the graph-Laplacian. However, as supervision decreases, Dirichlet optimization becomes suboptimal. We therefore would like to obtain a smooth transition between unsupervised clustering and low-supervised graph-based classification. In this paper, we propose a new type of graph-Laplacian which is adapted for Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) problems. It is based on both density and contrastive measures and allows the encoding of the labeled data directly in the operator. Thus, we can perform successfully semi-supervised learning using spectral clustering. The benefits of our approach are illustrated for several SSL problems. ",

    "abstract": "Saliency methods generating visual explanatory maps representing the importance of image pixels for model classification is a popular technique for explaining neural network decisions. Hierarchical dynamic masks (HDM), a novel explanatory maps generation method, is proposed in this paper to enhance the granularity and comprehensiveness of saliency maps. First, we suggest the dynamic masks (DM), which enables multiple small-sized benchmark mask vectors to roughly learn the critical information in the image through an optimization method. Then the benchmark mask vectors guide the learning of large-sized auxiliary mask vectors so that their superimposed mask can accurately learn fine-grained pixel importance information and reduce the sensitivity to adversarial perturbations. In addition, we construct the HDM by concatenating DM modules. These DM modules are used to find and fuse the regions of interest in the remaining neural network classification decisions in the mask image in a learning-based way. Since HDM forces DM to perform importance analysis in different areas, it makes the fused saliency map more comprehensive. The proposed method outperformed previous approaches significantly in terms of recognition and localization capabilities when tested on natural and medical datasets. ",

Thus, in this work, we will introduce a novel graph neural network architecture (WGP-NN) employing (weighted) Gaussian processes (GP) to jointly model the temporal evolution of the occurrence probability of events and their time-dependent uncertainty. Especially we employ Gaussian processes to model the uncertainty of future links by their ability to predict predictive variance. This is in contrast to existing works, which are only able to express uncertainties in the learned entity representations. Moreover, WGP-NN can model parameter-free complex temporal and structural dynamics of tKGs in continuous time.

    "abstract": "The development and progress in sensor, communication and computing technologies have led to data rich environments. In such environments, data can easily be acquired not only from the monitored entities but also from the surroundings where the entity is operating. The additional data that are available from the problem domain, which cannot be used independently for learning models, constitute context. Such context, if taken into account while learning, can potentially improve the performance of predictive models. Typically, the data from various sensors are present in the form of time series. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are preferred for such data as it can inherently handle temporal context. However, the conventional RNN models such as Elman RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) in their present form do not provide any mechanism to integrate explicit contexts. In this paper, we propose a Context Integrated RNN (CiRNN) that enables integrating explicit contexts represented in the form of contextual features. In CiRNN, the network weights are influenced by contextual features in such a way that the primary input features which are more relevant to a given context are given more importance. To show the efficacy of CiRNN, we selected an application domain, engine health prognostics, which captures data from various sensors and where contextual information is available. We used the NASA Turbofan Engine Degradation Simulation dataset for estimating Remaining Useful Life (RUL) as it provides contextual information. We compared CiRNN with baseline models as well as the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show an improvement of 39% and 87% respectively, over state-of-the art models, when performance is measured with RMSE and score from an asymmetric scoring function. The latter measure is specific to the task of RUL estimation. ",

The Serenity framework exploits two basic mechanisms: (a) reliance on dynamic dispatch at the core of language translation, and (b) extreme abstraction of libraries, to generate an abstraction of the code. We demonstrate the efficiency and usefulness of Serenity's analysis in two applications: code completion and automated machine learning. In these two applications, we demonstrate that such analysis has a strong signal, and can be leveraged to establish state-of-the-art performance, comparable to neural models and dynamic analysis respectively.

Executing a layer in a BNN on different devices of a heterogeneous multiprocessor platform consisting of CPU and GPU can affect the inference performance, i.e., accuracy and latency. Usually, a heterogeneous HW platform consisting of a CPU and a GPU is available to execute the BNN workloads. However, to use the heterogeneous HW effectively, it is necessary to find an efficient strategy for BNN workload mapping. In this work, we propose a framework that generates efficient BNN layer-to-device mappings (i.e. suitable parallel configuration for each layer of the model) for execution platforms comprised of CPU and CUDA-capable GPU. We evaluate our proposed framework with two BNN architectures using two well-known datasets, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10, on three hardware platforms with different characteristics. The results show that compared to running a fully-parallelized GPU implementation, our framework generates an efficient configuration up to 2x, 2.6x and 11.8x faster on our tested hardware respectively.

Such systems need not be asymptotically stable, since they are merely nonexpansive but not contractive. Thus, we introduce a stricter version of monotonicity, termed \"type-K\" in honor of Kamke, and we prove the asymptotic stability of the equilibrium points, as well as the convergence of all trajectories to such equilibria for type-K monotone and plus-homogeneous systems: we call them \"K-topical\". Since topical maps are the natural nonlinear counterpart of linear maps defined by row-stochastic matrices, which are a cornerstone in the convergence analysis of linear multi-agent systems (MASs), we exploit our results for solving the consensus problem over nonlinear K-topical MASs. We first provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the local interaction rules of the agents ensuring the K-topicality of a MAS. Then, we prove that the agents achieve consensus asymptotically if the graph describing their interactions contains a globally reachable node. Finally, several examples for continuous-time and discrete-time systems are discussed to corroborate the enforceability of our results in different applications. ",

However, motivated by the current technical limitations of distribution networks (e.g., protection schemes), existing literature on ADN flexibility and TSO-DSO coordination mostly focuses on radial networks, overlooking the potential benefits of network reconfiguration. This paper, using a realistic meshed distribution system from the UK and the exact ACOPF model for flexibility estimation, demonstrates that network reconfiguration can increase the limits of ADN aggregated flexibility and improve the economic efficiency of flexibility markets.

Ubiquitous in our daily life, singed-directed graphs are the most complex and tricky to analyze among various graph types. That is why singed-directed graph contrastive learning has not been studied much yet, while there are many contrastive studies for unsigned and undirected. Thus, this paper proposes a novel signed-directed graph contrastive learning, SDGCL. It makes two different structurally perturbed graph views and gets node representations via magnetic Laplacian perturbation. We use a node-level contrastive loss to maximize the mutual information between the two graph views. The model is jointly learned with contrastive and supervised objectives. The graph encoder of SDGCL does not depend on social theories or predefined assumptions. Therefore it does not require finding triads or selecting neighbors to aggregate. It leverages only the edge signs and directions via magnetic Laplacian. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to introduce magnetic Laplacian perturbation and signed spectral graph contrastive learning. The superiority of the proposed model is demonstrated through exhaustive experiments on four real-world datasets. SDGCL shows better performance than other state-of-the-art on four evaluation metrics. ",

Through extensive experiments, we find that models built with the knowledge of disentangled or object-centric representations significantly outperform their distributed counterparts.

While the computational power has increased significantly over the years, detection and prediction of workload failures have lagged far behind and will become increasingly critical as the system scale and complexity further increase. In this study, we analyze workload traces collected from a production cluster and train machine learning models on a large amount of data sets to predict workload failures. Our prediction models consist of a queue-time model that estimates the probability of workload failures before execution and a runtime model that predicts failures at runtime. Evaluation results show that the queue-time model and runtime model can predict workload failures with a maximum precision score of 90.61% and 97.75%, respectively. By integrating the runtime model with the job scheduler, it helps reduce CPU time, and memory usage by up to 16.7% and 14.53%, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently advanced numerous vision-related areas. INR performance depends strongly on the choice of the nonlinear activation function employed in its multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. A wide range of nonlinearities have been explored, but, unfortunately, current INRs designed to have high accuracy also suffer from poor robustness (to signal noise, parameter variation, etc.). Inspired by harmonic analysis, we develop a new, highly accurate and robust INR that does not exhibit this tradeoff. Wavelet Implicit neural REpresentation (WIRE) uses a continuous complex Gabor wavelet activation function that is well-known to be optimally concentrated in space-frequency and to have excellent biases for representing images. A wide range of experiments (image denoising, image inpainting, super-resolution, computed tomography reconstruction, image overfitting, and novel view synthesis with neural radiance fields) demonstrate that WIRE defines the new state of the art in INR accuracy, training time, and robustness.

    "title": "Why is the State of Neural Network Pruning so Confusing? On the  Fairness, Comparison Setup, and Trainability in Network Pruning",
    "abstract": "The state of neural network pruning has been noticed to be unclear and even confusing for a while, largely due to \"a lack of standardized benchmarks and metrics\" [3]. To standardize benchmarks, first, we need to answer: what kind of comparison setup is considered fair? This basic yet crucial question has barely been clarified in the community, unfortunately. Meanwhile, we observe several papers have used (severely) sub-optimal hyper-parameters in pruning experiments, while the reason behind them is also elusive. These sub-optimal hyper-parameters further exacerbate the distorted benchmarks, rendering the state of neural network pruning even more obscure. Two mysteries in pruning represent such a confusing status: the performance-boosting effect of a larger finetuning learning rate, and the no-value argument of inheriting pretrained weights in filter pruning. In this work, we attempt to explain the confusing state of network pruning by demystifying the two mysteries. Specifically, (1) we first clarify the fairness principle in pruning experiments and summarize the widely-used comparison setups; (2) then we unveil the two pruning mysteries and point out the central role of network trainability, which has not been well recognized so far; (3) finally, we conclude the paper and give some concrete suggestions regarding how to calibrate the pruning benchmarks in the future.

NER in French and other relatively limited-resource languages cannot always benefit from approaches proposed for languages like English due to a dearth of large, robust datasets. In this paper, we present our work that aims to mitigate the effects of this dearth of large, labeled datasets. We propose a Transformer-based NER approach for French, using adversarial adaptation to similar domain or general corpora to improve feature extraction and enable better generalization. Our approach allows learning better features using large-scale unlabeled corpora from the same domain or mixed domains to introduce more variations during training and reduce overfitting. Experimental results on three labeled datasets show that our adaptation framework outperforms the corresponding non-adaptive models for various combinations of Transformer models, source datasets, and target corpora. We also show that adversarial adaptation to large-scale unlabeled corpora can help mitigate the performance dip incurred on using Transformer models pre-trained on smaller corpora. ",

    "abstract": "Variational inference has been widely used in machine learning literature to fit various Bayesian models. In network analysis, this method has been successfully applied to solve the community detection problems. Although these results are promising, their theoretical support is only for relatively dense networks, an assumption that may not hold for real networks. In addition, it has been shown recently that the variational loss surface has many saddle points, which may severely affect its performance, especially when applied to sparse networks. This paper proposes a simple way to improve the variational inference method by hard thresholding the posterior of the community assignment after each iteration. Using a random initialization that correlates with the true community assignment, we show that the proposed method converges and can accurately recover the true community labels, even when the average node degree of the network is bounded. Extensive numerical study further confirms the advantage of the proposed method over the classical variational inference and another state-of-the-art algorithm. ",

It is known that the dichromatic number of $D$ is at most $\\Delta_{\\min}(D) + 1$.

Statistical learning theory suggests that generalisation power of neural networks relies on independence and identical distribution (i.i.d.)\\ of training and testing data. Although this assumption together with an appropriate neural architecture and a learning mechanism is sufficient for accurate out-of-sample predictions of dynamics such as, e.g.\\ mass-action kinetics, by studying the out-of-distribution generalisation in the case of diffusion dynamics, we find that the neural network model: (i) has a generalisation capacity that depends on the first moment of the initial value data distribution; (ii) learns the non-dissipative nature of dynamics implicitly; and (iii) the model's accuracy resolution limit is of order $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{n})$ for a system of size $n$.

To this end, the underlying uncertain nonlinear system is decomposed based on a first-order Taylor series expansion into a nominal system and an error (deviation) described as an uncertain linear time-varying system. This decomposition allows us to leverage system level synthesis to optimize an affine error feedback while planning the nominal trajectory and ensuring robust constraint satisfaction for the nonlinear system. The proposed approach thereby results in a less conservative planning compared with state-of-the-art techniques. A tailored sequential quadratic programming strategy is proposed to solve the resulting nonlinear program efficiently.

The measurements and the simulations could be time-consuming and expensive, and machine learning and Big Data approaches can help to predict breakthrough curves at lower costs. Machine learning (ML) methods, such as Gaussian processes and fully-connected neural networks, and a tensor method, cross approximation, are well suited for predicting breakthrough curves.

The offered efficient implementation novel waveform design technique utilizes only a single $\\mathsf{PAPR}$ reduction block for all antennas.
