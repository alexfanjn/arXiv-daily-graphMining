    "title": "Fully Elman Neural Network: A Novel Deep Recurrent Neural Network  Optimized by an Improved Harris Hawks Algorithm for Classification of  Pulmonary Arterial Wedge Pressure",
    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is one of the most prevalent life-threatening cardiovascular diseases in which 6.5 million people are suffering in the USA and more than 23 million worldwide. Mechanical circulatory support of HF patients can be achieved by implanting a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) into HF patients as a bridge to transplant, recovery or destination therapy and can be controlled by measurement of normal and abnormal pulmonary arterial wedge pressure (PAWP). While there are no commercial long-term implantable pressure sensors to measure PAWP, real-time non-invasive estimation of abnormal and normal PAWP becomes vital. In this work, first an improved Harris Hawks optimizer algorithm called HHO+ is presented and tested on 24 unimodal and multimodal benchmark functions. Second, a novel fully Elman neural network (FENN) is proposed to improve the classification performance. Finally, four novel 18-layer deep learning methods of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multi-layer perceptron (CNN-MLP), CNN with Elman neural networks (CNN-ENN), CNN with fully Elman neural networks (CNN-FENN), and CNN with fully Elman neural networks optimized by HHO+ algorithm (CNN-FENN-HHO+) for classification of abnormal and normal PAWP using estimated HVAD pump flow were developed and compared. The estimated pump flow was derived by a non-invasive method embedded into the commercial HVAD controller. The proposed methods are evaluated on an imbalanced clinical dataset using 5-fold cross-validation. The proposed CNN-FENN-HHO+ method outperforms the proposed CNN-MLP, CNN-ENN and CNN-FENN methods and improved the classification performance metrics across 5-fold cross-validation. The proposed methods can reduce the likelihood of hazardous events like pulmonary congestion and ventricular suction for HF patients and notify identified abnormal cases to the hospital, clinician and cardiologist.

This approach brings together the best of modern optimization-based temporal logic planners and older automata-theoretic methods, addressing the limitations of each: paths are represented with continuous Bezier curves, avoiding clipping and pass-through; computational complexity is polynomial (not exponential) in the number of sample points; global optimality can be certified; soundness and completeness are guaranteed under mild assumptions; and most importantly, the method scales to complex specifications and high-dimensional systems, including a 30-DoF humanoid.

Recent ensemble training method explores different training algorithms or settings on multiple sub-models with the same model architecture, which lead to significant burden on memory and computation cost of the ensemble model. Meanwhile, the heurtsically induced diversity may not lead to significant performance gain. We propose a new prespective on exploring the intrinsic diversity within a model architecture to build efficient DNN ensemble. We make an intriguing observation that pruning and quantization, while both leading to efficient model architecture at the cost of small accuracy drop, leads to distinct behavior in the decision boundary. To this end, we propose Heterogeneously Compressed Ensemble (HCE), where we build an efficient ensemble with the pruned and quantized variants from a pretrained DNN model. An diversity-aware training objective is proposed to further boost the performance of the HCE ensemble. Experiemnt result shows that HCE achieves significant improvement in the efficiency-accuracy tradeoff comparing to both traditional DNN ensemble training methods and previous model compression methods.

    "abstract": "Accurate local state measurement is important to ensure the reliable operation of distributed multi-agent systems (MAS). Existing fault-tolerant control strategies generally assume the sensor faults to be bounded and uncorrelated. In this paper, we study the ramifications of allowing the sensor attack injections to be unbounded and correlated. These malicious sensor attacks may bypass the conventional attack-detection methods and compromise the cooperative performance and even stability of the distributed networked MAS. Moreover, the attackers may gain access to the actuation computing channels and manipulate the control input commands. To this end, we consider the resilient containment control problem of general linear heterogeneous MAS in the face of correlated and unbounded sensor attacks, as well as general unbounded actuator attacks. We propose an attack-resilient control framework to guarantee the uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop dynamical systems and preserve the bounded containment performance. Compared with existing literature addressing bounded faults and/or disturbances that are unintentionally caused in the sensor and actuator channels, the proposed control protocols are resilient against unknown unbounded attack signals simultaneously injected into sensor and actuator channels, and hence are more practical in the real-world security applications. A numerical example illustrates the efficacy of the proposed result, by highlighting the resilience improvement over the conventional cooperative control method. ",

    "abstract": "As a representative of public transportation, the fundamental issue of managing bike-sharing systems is bike flow prediction. Recent methods overemphasize the spatio-temporal correlations in the data, ignoring the effects of contextual conditions on the transportation system and the inter-regional timevarying causality. In addition, due to the disturbance of incomplete observations in the data, random contextual conditions lead to spurious correlations between data and features, making the prediction of the model ineffective in special scenarios. To overcome this issue, we propose a Spatio-temporal Neural Structure Causal Model(STNSCM) from the perspective of causality. First, we build a causal graph to describe the traffic prediction, and further analyze the causal relationship between the input data, contextual conditions, spatiotemporal states, and prediction results. Second, we propose to apply the frontdoor criterion to eliminate confounding biases in the feature extraction process. Finally, we propose a counterfactual representation reasoning module to extrapolate the spatio-temporal state under the factual scenario to future counterfactual scenarios to improve the prediction performance. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model, especially its resistance to fluctuations caused by the external environment. The source code and data will be released. ",

For many real-world machine learning applications, the data distribution often shifts gradually along domain indices. For example, a self-driving car with a vision system drives from dawn to dusk, with the sky darkening gradually. Therefore, the system must be able to adapt to changes in ambient illumination and continue to drive safely on the road. In this paper, we formulate such problems as Evolving Domain Generalization, where a model aims to generalize well on a target domain by discovering and leveraging the evolving pattern of the environment. We then propose Directional Domain Augmentation (DDA), which simulates the unseen target features by mapping source data as augmentations through a domain transformer. Specifically, we formulate DDA as a bi-level optimization problem and solve it through a novel meta-learning approach in the representation space. We evaluate the proposed method on both synthetic datasets and realworld datasets, and empirical results show that our approach can outperform other existing methods. ",

To circumvent these problems, this study proposes ClusterLog, a log pre-processing method that clusters the temporal sequence of log keys based on their semantic similarity. By grouping semantically and sentimentally similar logs, this approach aims to represent log sequences with the smallest amount of unique log keys, intending to improve the ability of a downstream sequence-based model to effectively learn the log patterns. The preliminary results of ClusterLog indicate not only its effectiveness in reducing the granularity of log sequences without the loss of important sequence information but also its generalizability to different file systems' logs.

Previous research has shown that deterministically computing an arbitrary function of a multiset of input values given to these processes takes only a linear number of communication rounds. However, fast algorithms for anonymous dynamic networks rely on the construction and communication of large data structures called \"history trees\", whose size is polynomial in the number of processes. This approach is unfeasible if the network is \"congested\", and only messages of logarithmic size can be sent though its links. Observe that sending a large message piece by piece over several rounds is not in itself a solution, due to the anonymity of the processes combined with the dynamic nature of the network. Moreover, it is known that certain basic tasks such as all-to-all token dissemination (by means of single-token forwarding) require $\\Omega(n^2/\\log n)$ rounds in congested networks. In this work, we develop a series of practical and efficient techniques that make it possible to use history trees in congested anonymous dynamic networks. Among other applications, we show how to compute arbitrary functions in such networks in $O(n^3)$ communication rounds, greatly improving upon previous state-of-the-art algorithms for congested networks.

This embedding provides a scalable approach for safety analysis of the neural control loop while preserving the nonlinear structure of the system. We show that one can efficiently compute hyper-rectangular over-approximations of the reachable sets using a single trajectory of the embedding system. We design an algorithm to leverage this computational advantage through partitioning strategies, improving our reachable set estimates while balancing its runtime with tunable parameters. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm through two case studies. First, we demonstrate this method's strength in complex nonlinear environments.

    "abstract": "As a core technology of Intelligent Transportation System, traffic flow prediction has a wide range of applications. The fundamental challenge in traffic flow prediction is to effectively model the complex spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic data. Spatial-temporal Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have emerged as one of the most promising methods to solve this problem. However, GNN-based models have three major limitations for traffic prediction: i) Most methods model spatial dependencies in a static manner, which limits the ability to learn dynamic urban traffic patterns; ii) Most methods only consider short-range spatial information and are unable to capture long-range spatial dependencies; iii) These methods ignore the fact that the propagation of traffic conditions between locations has a time delay in traffic systems. To this end, we propose a novel Propagation Delay-aware dynamic long-range transFormer, namely PDFormer, for accurate traffic flow prediction. Specifically, we design a spatial self-attention module to capture the dynamic spatial dependencies. Then, two graph masking matrices are introduced to highlight spatial dependencies from short- and long-range views. Moreover, a traffic delay-aware feature transformation module is proposed to empower PDFormer with the capability of explicitly modeling the time delay of spatial information propagation. Extensive experimental results on six real-world public traffic datasets show that our method can not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but also exhibit competitive computational efficiency. Moreover, we visualize the learned spatial-temporal attention map to make our model highly interpretable. ",

    "abstract": "One surprising trait of neural networks is the extent to which their connections can be pruned with little to no effect on accuracy. But when we cross a critical level of parameter sparsity, pruning any further leads to a sudden drop in accuracy. This drop plausibly reflects a loss in model complexity, which we aim to avoid. In this work, we explore how sparsity also affects the geometry of the linear regions defined by a neural network, and consequently reduces the expected maximum number of linear regions based on the architecture. We observe that pruning affects accuracy similarly to how sparsity affects the number of linear regions and our proposed bound for the maximum number. Conversely, we find out that selecting the sparsity across layers to maximize our bound very often improves accuracy in comparison to pruning as much with the same sparsity in all layers, thereby providing us guidance on where to prune.

    "title": "On the Effect of Transitivity and Granularity on Vulnerability  Propagation in the Maven Ecosystem",
    "abstract": "Reusing software libraries is a pillar of modern software engineering. In 2022, the average Java application depends on 40 third-party libraries. Relying on such libraries exposes a project to potential vulnerabilities and may put an application and its users at risk. Unfortunately, research on software ecosystems has shown that the number of projects that are affected by such vulnerabilities is rising. Previous investigations usually reason about dependencies on the dependency level, but we believe that this highly inflates the actual number of affected projects. In this work, we study the effect of transitivity and granularity on vulnerability propagation in the Maven ecosystem. In our research methodology, we gather a large dataset of 3M recent Maven packages. We obtain the full transitive set of dependencies for this dataset, construct whole-program call graphs, and perform reachability analysis. This approach allows us to identify Maven packages that are actually affected by using vulnerable dependencies. Our empirical results show that: (1) about 1/3 of packages in our dataset are identified as vulnerable if and only if all the transitive dependencies are considered. (2) less than 1% of packages have a reachable call path to vulnerable code in their dependencies, which is far lower than that of a naive dependency-based analysis. (3) limiting the depth of the resolved dependency tree might be a useful technique to reduce computation time for expensive fine-grained (vulnerability) analysis. We discuss the implications of our work and provide actionable insights for researchers and practitioners. ",

Unfortunately, despite successes of (gold standard) retrospective studies of misinformation that confirmed their harmful effects after the fact, they arrive too late for timely intervention and reduction of such harm. By design, misinformation evades retrospective classifiers by exploiting two properties we call new-normal: (1) never-seen-before novelty that cause inescapable generalization challenges for previous classifiers, and (2) massive but short campaigns that end before they can be manually annotated for new classifier training. To tackle these challenges, we propose UFIT, which combines two techniques: semantic masking of strong signal keywords to reduce overfitting, and intra-proxy smoothness regularization of high-density regions in the latent space to improve reliability and maintain accuracy. Evaluation of UFIT on public new-normal misinformation data shows over 30% improvement over existing approaches on future (and unseen) campaigns. To the best of our knowledge, UFIT is the first successful effort to achieve such high level of generalization on new-normal misinformation data with minimal concession (1 to 5%) of accuracy compared to oracles trained with full knowledge of all campaigns.

In the proposed sequential approach, robust control is implemented after an exploration phase with the main feature that the exploration is optimized w.r.t. the robust control performance. Specifically, we leverage recent results on finite excitation using spectral lines to determine a high probability lower bound on the resultant finite excitation of the exploration data. This provides an a priori upper bound on the remaining model uncertainty after exploration, which can further be leveraged in a gain-scheduling controller design that guarantees robust performance. This leads to a semidefinite program-based design which computes an exploration strategy with finite excitation bounds and minimal energy, and a gain-scheduled controller with probabilistic performance bounds that can be implemented after exploration. The effectiveness of our approach and its benefits over common random exploration strategies are demonstrated with an example of a system which is 'hard to learn'. ",

Due to their deterministic and sequential nature, TADS can, similarly to decision trees, be considered as white-box models and therefore as precise solutions to the model and outcome explanation problem. TADS are linear algebras which allows one to elegantly compare Rectifier Networks for equivalence or similarity, both with precise diagnostic information in case of failure, and to characterize their classification potential by precisely characterizing the set of inputs that are specifically classified or the set of inputs where two network-based classifiers differ.

This is made possible by taking advantage of the programmable and reconfigurable features of MPSoC with an FPGA. A persistent attack that analyzes and exploits the vulnerability of a core will not be able to exploit it as rejuvenation to a different core architecture is made fast enough.

In this paper, infrared lasers referred to as vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) are used as transmitters sending information to multiple users. In OWC, rate-maximization optimization problems are usually complex due to the high number of optical access points (APs) needed to ensure coverage. Therefore, practical solutions with low computational time are essential to cope with frequent updates in user-requirements that might occur. In this context, we formulate an optimization problem to determine the optimal user association and resource allocation in the network, while the serving time is partitioned into a series of time periods. Therefore, cooperative ANN models are designed to estimate and predict the association and resource allocation variables for each user such that sub-optimal solutions can be obtained within a certain period of time prior to its actual starting, which makes the solutions valid and in accordance with the demands of the users at a given time. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed model in maximizing the sum rate of the network compared with counterpart models. Moreover, ANN-based solutions are close to the optimal ones with low computational time. ",

This advanced mobile communication technology has more advancements, such as higher system capacity, higher spectrum efficiency, higher data rates, and so on. In 5G, Ultra- Dense Network (UDN) is deployed for increasing the system capacity and frequency reuse to meet high application requirements. The architecture of 5G UDN is to realize the dense and flexible deployment of smaller general Node B (gNB). However, the increased capacity of applying UDN in 5G is anticipated at the cost of increased signal interference, increased handover times, and increased handover failures. The Time to Trigger (TTT) is one of the most important factors in handover frequency which is deserved to be detected. Moreover, the density of the 5G gNBs influences the handover times and performance as well. In this work, we provide a compendium of 5G handover management. A downlink system-level simulator for 5G handover is built and utilized to evaluate the effect of different TTT values and densities of gNBs on the 5G handover. In addition, different velocities of Traffic Users (TUs) have been applied to the simulation system. From the simulation results, the handover performance has been analyzed and optimized by applying adjustable TTT under different densities of gNBs which will help people have a better understanding of the selection and effect of proper TTT, UDN, and different velocities of TUs on 5G handover performance.

During inference, we can detect and localize anomalies by considering the error of the position estimate of a given patch. We apply our method to 3D CT volumes and evaluate it on patients with intracranial haemorrhages and cranial fractures. The results show that our method performs well in detecting these anomalies. Furthermore, we show that our method requires less memory than comparable approaches that involve image reconstruction.

Supplying that information has two main challenges: how to represent this information in a form that is feedable to the GANs and how to effectively feed the representation to the GAN. To address these issues, we developed a suitable representation of CNN architectures by cumulatively averaging intermediate interpretation maps. We also propose two alternative approaches to feed the representations to the GAN and to choose an effective training strategy. Our approach learned the general aspects of CNNs and was agnostic to datasets and CNN architectures. The study includes both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and compares the proposed GANs with state-of-the-art approaches. We found that the initial layers of CNNs and final layers are equally crucial for interpreting CNNs upon interpreting the proposed GAN. We believe training a GAN to interpret CNNs would open doors for improved interpretations by leveraging fast-paced deep learning advancements.

We aim to maximize the sum rate of all the users by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming at the BSs and the reflection coefficients at the IRS. To address the optimization problem, we propose a fully distributed machine learning algorithm. Compared with the conventional iterative optimization algorithms that require a central processing at the central processing unit and large amount of channel state information and signaling exchange among the BSs, each BS can locally design its beamforming vector in the proposed algorithm. Meanwhile, the IRS reflection coefficients are determined by one of the BSs. Simulation results show that the deployment of IRS can significantly boost the sum user rate and that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmark methods. ",

The problem is formulated under constraints on the FlyBS's flying speed, propulsion power consumption, and transmission power for both of flying and ground base stations. None of the existing solutions maximizing the sum capacity can be applied due to the combination of these practical constraints. This paper pioneers in an inclusion of all these constraints together with backhaul to derive the optimal 3D positions of the FlyBS and to optimize the transmission power allocation for the channels at both backhaul and access links as the users move over time. The proposed solution is geometrical based, and it shows via simulations a significant increase in the sum capacity (up by 19%-47%) compared with baseline schemes where one or more of the aspects of backhaul communication, transmission power allocation, and FlyBS's positioning are not taken into account.

This study investigates methods for Knowledge Distillation (KD) to provide efficient alternatives to large-scale models. In this context, KD means extracting information about language encoded in a Neural Network and Lexical Knowledge Databases. We developed two methods to test our hypothesis that efficient architectures can gain knowledge from LMs and extract valuable information from lexical sources. First, we present a technique to learn confident probability distribution for Masked Language Modeling by prediction weighting of multiple teacher networks. Second, we propose a method for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and lexical KD that is general enough to be adapted to many LMs. Our results show that KD with multiple teachers leads to improved training convergence. When using our lexical pre-training method, LM characteristics are not lost, leading to increased performance in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks over the state-of-the-art while adding no parameters. Moreover, the improved semantic understanding of our model increased the task performance beyond WSD and NLU in a real-problem scenario (Plagiarism Detection). This study suggests that sophisticated training methods and network architectures can be superior over scaling trainable parameters. On this basis, we suggest the research area should encourage the development and use of efficient models and rate impacts resulting from growing LM size equally against task performance. ",

In industry, deep neural network-based models are widely adopted for modeling such problems. Researchers proposed various neural network architectures for searching and modeling the feature interactions in an end-to-end fashion. However, most methods only learn static feature interactions and have not fully leveraged deep CTR models' representation capacity. In this paper, we propose a new model: DynInt. By extending Polynomial-Interaction-Network (PIN), which learns higher-order interactions recursively to be dynamic and data-dependent, DynInt further derived two modes for modeling dynamic higher-order interactions: dynamic activation and dynamic parameter. In dynamic activation mode, we adaptively adjust the strength of learned interactions by instance-aware activation gating networks. In dynamic parameter mode, we re-parameterize the parameters by different formulations and dynamically generate the parameters by instance-aware parameter generation networks. Through instance-aware gating mechanism and dynamic parameter generation, we enable the PIN to model dynamic interaction for potential industry applications. We implement the proposed model and evaluate the model performance on real-world datasets. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of DynInt over state-of-the-art models. ",

Currently, analyzing and quantifying dopaminergic neurons is conducted manually by experts through analysis of digital pathology images which is laborious, time-consuming, and highly subjective.

    "abstract": "Few-shot semantic segmentation is the task of learning to locate each pixel of the novel class in the query image with only a few annotated support images. The current correlation-based methods construct pair-wise feature correlations to establish the many-to-many matching because the typical prototype-based approaches cannot learn fine-grained correspondence relations. However, the existing methods still suffer from the noise contained in naive correlations and the lack of context semantic information in correlations. To alleviate these problems mentioned above, we propose a Feature-Enhanced Context-Aware Network (FECANet). Specifically, a feature enhancement module is proposed to suppress the matching noise caused by inter-class local similarity and enhance the intra-class relevance in the naive correlation. In addition, we propose a novel correlation reconstruction module that encodes extra correspondence relations between foreground and background and multi-scale context semantic features, significantly boosting the encoder to capture a reliable matching pattern. Experiments on PASCAL-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$ datasets demonstrate that our proposed FECANet leads to remarkable improvement compared to previous state-of-the-arts, demonstrating its effectiveness. ",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a popular distributed machine learning paradigm that enables jointly training a global model without sharing clients' data. However, its repetitive server-client communication gives room for backdoor attacks with aim to mislead the global model into a targeted misprediction when a specific trigger pattern is presented. In response to such backdoor threats on federated learning, various defense measures have been proposed. In this paper, we study whether the current defense mechanisms truly neutralize the backdoor threats from federated learning in a practical setting by proposing a new federated backdoor attack method for possible countermeasures. Different from traditional training (on triggered data) and rescaling (the malicious client model) based backdoor injection, the proposed backdoor attack framework (1) directly modifies (a small proportion of) local model weights to inject the backdoor trigger via sign flips; (2) jointly optimize the trigger pattern with the client model, thus is more persistent and stealthy for circumventing existing defenses. In a case study, we examine the strength and weaknesses of recent federated backdoor defenses from three major categories and provide suggestions to the practitioners when training federated models in practice.

On these platforms, the tie formation process depends on two factors: (a) the exposure of users to CCs (decided by, e.g., a recommender system), and (b) the following decision-making process of users. Recent research studies underlined the importance of content quality by showing that under exploratory recommendation strategies, the network eventually converges to a state where the higher the quality of the CC, the higher their expected number of followers. In this paper, we extend prior work by (a) looking beyond averages to assess the fairness of the process and (b) investigating the importance of exploratory recommendations for achieving fair outcomes. Using an analytical approach, we show that non-exploratory recommendations converge fast but usually lead to unfair outcomes. Moreover, even with exploration, we are only guaranteed fair outcomes for the highest (and lowest) quality CCs. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in graph-structured data computation, showing promising performance in various applications such as node classification, link prediction, and network recommendation. Existing works mainly focus on node-wise correlation when doing weighted aggregation of neighboring nodes based on attention, such as dot product by the dense vectors of two nodes. This may cause conflicting noise in nodes to be propagated when doing information propagation. To solve this problem, we propose a General Information Propagation Algorithm (GIPA in short), which exploits more fine-grained information fusion including bit-wise and feature-wise correlations based on edge features in their propagation. Specifically, the bit-wise correlation calculates the element-wise attention weight through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) based on the dense representations of two nodes and their edge; The feature-wise correlation is based on the one-hot representations of node attribute features for feature selection. We evaluate the performance of GIPA on the Open Graph Benchmark proteins (OGBN-proteins for short) dataset and the Alipay dataset of Alibaba. Experimental results reveal that GIPA outperforms the state-of-the-art models in terms of prediction accuracy, e.g., GIPA achieves an average ROC-AUC of $0.8901\\pm 0.0011$, which is better than that of all the existing methods listed in the OGBN-proteins leaderboard.

    "abstract": "Active Speaker Detection (ASD) aims to identify who is speaking in each frame of a video. ASD reasons from audio and visual information from two contexts: long-term intra-speaker context and short-term inter-speaker context. Long-term intra-speaker context models the temporal dependencies of the same speaker, while short-term inter-speaker context models the interactions of speakers in the same scene. These two contexts are complementary to each other and can help infer the active speaker. Motivated by these observations, we propose LoCoNet, a simple yet effective Long-Short Context Network that models the long-term intra-speaker context and short-term inter-speaker context. We use self-attention to model long-term intra-speaker context due to its effectiveness in modeling long-range dependencies, and convolutional blocks that capture local patterns to model short-term inter-speaker context. Extensive experiments show that LoCoNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets, achieving an mAP of 95.2%(+1.1%) on AVA-ActiveSpeaker, 68.1%(+22%) on Columbia dataset, 97.2%(+2.8%) on Talkies dataset and 59.7%(+8.0%) on Ego4D dataset. Moreover, in challenging cases where multiple speakers are present, or face of active speaker is much smaller than other faces in the same scene, LoCoNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 3.4% on the AVA-ActiveSpeaker dataset.

    "abstract": "This paper demonstrates an approach for learning highly semantic image representations without relying on hand-crafted data-augmentations. We introduce the Image-based Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (I-JEPA), a non-generative approach for self-supervised learning from images. The idea behind I-JEPA is simple: from a single context block, predict the representations of various target blocks in the same image. A core design choice to guide I-JEPA towards producing semantic representations is the masking strategy; specifically, it is crucial to (a) predict several target blocks in the image, (b) sample target blocks with sufficiently large scale (occupying 15%-20% of the image), and (c) use a sufficiently informative (spatially distributed) context block. Empirically, when combined with Vision Transformers, we find I-JEPA to be highly scalable. For instance, we train a ViT-Huge/16 on ImageNet using 32 A100 GPUs in under 38 hours to achieve strong downstream performance across a wide range of tasks requiring various levels of abstraction, from linear classification to object counting and depth prediction.

In this paper, we compare PINNs trained with different amounts of governing equation evaluation points and known solution points. Comparing models that were trained purely with known solution points to those that have also used the governing equations, we observe an improvement in the overall observance of the underlying physics in the latter. We also investigate how changing the number of each type of point affects the resulting models differently. Finally, we argue that the addition of the governing equations during training may provide a way to improve the overall performance of the model without relying on additional data, which is especially important for situations where the number of known solution points is limited.

Existing approaches focus either on the temporal structure of the observations by relying on conditional expectations, discarding thereby information ingrained in the geometry of the system's invariant density; or employ geometric approximations of the invariant density, which are nevertheless restricted to systems with conservative forces. Here we propose a method that reconciles these two paradigms. We introduce a new data-driven path augmentation scheme that takes the local observation geometry into account. By employing non-parametric inference on the augmented paths, we can efficiently identify the deterministic driving forces of the underlying system for systems observed at low sampling rates. ",

Here we aim to understand how the rocky morphology of minor bodies react to the well known space erosion agents on the Moon. We deploy a neural network and map a total of ~130,000 fragmented boulders scattered across the lunar surface and visually identify a dozen different desintegration morphologies corresponding to different failure modes. We find that several fragmented boulder morphologies are equivalent to morphologies observed on asteroid Bennu, suggesting that these morphologies on the Moon and on asteroids are likely not diagnostic of their formation mechanism. Our findings suggest that the boulder fragmentation process is characterized by an internal weakening period with limited morphological signs of damage at rock scale until a sudden highly efficient impact shattering event occurs. In addition, we identify new morphologies such as breccia boulders with an advection-like erosion style. We publicly release the produced fractured boulder catalog along with this paper. ",

A quantum training algorithm is proposed and classical simulations for the case of product outputs with the fidelity as cost function are carried out. We thereby demonstrate the potential of these algorithms to learn complex quantum processes with memory in terms of the exemplary delay channel, the time evolution of quantum states governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian, and high- and low-frequency noise mitigation.

The objectives are: (i) recovering the unknown linear transformation (up to scaling and ordering), and (ii) determining the directed acyclic graph (DAG) underlying the latent variables. Since identifiable representation learning is impossible based on only observational data, this paper uses both observational and interventional data. The interventional data is generated under distinct single-node randomized hard and soft interventions. These interventions are assumed to cover all nodes in the latent space. It is established that the latent DAG structure can be recovered under soft randomized interventions via the following two steps. First, a set of transformation candidates is formed by including all inverting transformations corresponding to which the \\emph{score} function of the transformed variables has the minimal number of coordinates that change between an interventional and the observational environment summed over all pairs. Subsequently, this set is distilled using a simple constraint to recover the latent DAG structure. For the special case of hard randomized interventions, with an additional hypothesis testing step, one can also uniquely recover the linear transformation, up to scaling and a valid causal ordering. These results generalize the recent results that either assume deterministic hard interventions or linear causal relationships in the latent space. ",
