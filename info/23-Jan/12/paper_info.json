    "abstract": "Face morphing attacks seek to deceive a Face Recognition (FR) system by presenting a morphed image consisting of the biometric qualities from two different identities with the aim of triggering a false acceptance with one of the two identities, thereby presenting a significant threat to biometric systems. The success of a morphing attack is dependent on the ability of the morphed image to represent the biometric characteristics of both identities that were used to create the image. We present a novel morphing attack that uses a Diffusion-based architecture to improve the visual fidelity of the image and improve the ability of the morphing attack to represent characteristics from both identities. We demonstrate the high fidelity of the proposed attack by evaluating its visual fidelity via the Frechet Inception Distance. Extensive experiments are conducted to measure the vulnerability of FR systems to the proposed attack. The proposed attack is compared to two state-of-the-art GAN-based morphing attacks along with two Landmark-based attacks. The ability of a morphing attack detector to detect the proposed attack is measured and compared against the other attacks. Additionally, a novel metric to measure the relative strength between morphing attacks is introduced and evaluated. ",

    "abstract": "mm-Wave communication systems use narrow directional beams due to the spectrum's characteristic nature: high path and penetration losses. The mobile and the base station primarily employ beams in line of sight (LoS) direction and when needed in non-line of sight direction. Beam management protocol adapts the base station and mobile side beam direction during user mobility and to sustain the link during blockages. To avoid outage in transient pedestrian blockage of the LoS path, the mobile uses reflected or NLoS path available in indoor environments. Reflected paths can sustain time synchronization and maintain connectivity during temporary blockages. In outdoor environments, such reflections may not be available and prior work relied on dense base station deployment or co-ordinated multi-point access to address outage problem. Instead of dense and hence cost-intensive network deployments, we found experimentally that the mobile can capitalize on ground reflection. We developed TERRA protocol to effectively handle mobile side beam direction during transient blockage events. TERRA avoids outage during pedestrian blockages 84.5 $\\%$ of the time in outdoor environments on concrete and gravel surfaces. TERRA also enables the mobile to perform a soft handover to a reserve neighbor base station in the event of a permanent blockage, without requiring any side information, unlike the existing works. Evaluations show that TERRA maintains received signal strength close to the optimal solution while keeping track of the neighbor base station. ",

    "abstract": "Cell-free massive MIMO is a promising technology for beyond-5G networks. Through the deployment of many cooperating access points (AP), the technology can significantly enhance user coverage and spectral efficiency compared to traditional cellular systems. Since the APs are distributed over a large area, the level of favorable propagation in cell-free massive MIMO is less than the one in colocated massive MIMO. As a result, the current linear processing schemes are not close to the optimal ones when the number of AP antennas is not very large. The aim of this paper is to develop nonlinear variational Bayes (VB) methods for data detection in cell-free massive MIMO systems. Contrary to existing work in the literature, which only attained point estimates of the transmit data symbols, the proposed methods aim to obtain the posterior distribution and the Bayes estimate of the data symbols. We develop the VB methods accordingly to the levels of cooperation among the APs. Simulation results show significant performance advantages of the developed VB methods over the linear processing techniques. ",

While most existing SFOD methods generate pseudo labels via a source-pretrained model to guide training, these pseudo labels usually contain high noises due to heavy domain discrepancy. In order to obtain better pseudo supervisions, we divide the target domain into source-similar and source-dissimilar parts and align them in the feature space by adversarial learning. Specifically, we design a detection variance-based criterion to divide the target domain. This criterion is motivated by a finding that larger detection variances denote higher recall and larger similarity to the source domain. Then we incorporate an adversarial module into a mean teacher framework to drive the feature spaces of these two subsets indistinguishable. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain object detection datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms the compared SFOD methods. ",

    "abstract": "Illegal intelligent reflecting surfaces (I-IRSs), i.e., the illegal deployment and utilization of IRSs, impose serious harmful impacts on wireless networks. The existing I-IRS-based illegal jammer (IJ) requires channel state information (CSI) or extra power or both, and therefore, the I-IRS-based IJ seems to be difficult to implement in practical wireless networks. To raise concerns about significant potential threats posed by I-IRSs, we propose an alternative method to jam legitimate users (LUs) without relying on the CSI. By using an I-IRS to actively change wireless channels, the orthogonality of multi-user beamforming vectors and the co-user channels is destroyed, and significant inter-user interference is then caused, which is referred to as active channel aging. Such a fully-passive jammer (FPJ) can launch jamming attacks on multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems via inter-user interference caused by active channel aging, where the IJ requires no additional transmit power and instantaneous CSI. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed FPJ scheme. Moreover, we also investigate how the transmit power and the number of quantization phase shift bits influence the jamming performance. ",

The features at multiple spatial dimensions of a pre-trained ResNet-50 are exploited with different views in the temporal dimension to form a temporal pyramid feature map. Based on that, the similarity between neighbor frames is calculated and projected to build a temporal pyramid similarity feature vector. A decoder with 1D convolution operations is used to decode these similarities to a new representation that incorporates their temporal relationship for later boundary score estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on the GEBD benchmark dataset show the effectiveness of our system and its variations, in which we outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches.

We posit that because of the stable vocabulary, relative idioms, and fixed expressions in English, the size and density of the word co-occurrence graph change slightly with the increase in the training corpus. So that Word-Graph2vec has stable runtime on the large scale data set, and its performance advantage becomes more and more obvious with the growth of the training corpus.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML)-based methods have recently become attractive for detecting security vulnerability exploits. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art ML models like long short-term memories (LSTMs) and transformers incur significant computation overheads. This overhead makes it infeasible to deploy them in real-time environments. We propose a novel ML-based exploit detection model, ML-FEED, that enables highly efficient inference without sacrificing performance. We develop a novel automated technique to extract vulnerability patterns from the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases. This feature enables ML-FEED to be aware of the latest cyber weaknesses. Second, it is not based on the traditional approach of classifying sequences of application programming interface (API) calls into exploit categories. Such traditional methods that process entire sequences incur huge computational overheads. Instead, ML-FEED operates at a finer granularity and predicts the exploits triggered by every API call of the program trace. Then, it uses a state table to update the states of these potential exploits and track the progress of potential exploit chains. ML-FEED also employs a feature engineering approach that uses natural language processing-based word embeddings, frequency vectors, and one-hot encoding to detect semantically-similar instruction calls. Then, it updates the states of the predicted exploit categories and triggers an alarm when a vulnerability fingerprint executes. Our experiments show that ML-FEED is 72.9x and 75,828.9x faster than state-of-the-art lightweight LSTM and transformer models, respectively. We trained and tested ML-FEED on 79 real-world exploit categories. It predicts categories of exploit in real-time with 98.2% precision, 97.4% recall, and 97.8% F1 score. These results also outperform the LSTM and transformer baselines. ",

Further, under the proposed framework, we devise a dual-regularizer graph convolutional network (dubbed tsGCN) to capture topological and semantic structures from graph data. Since the derived learning rule for tsGCN contains an inverse of a large matrix and thus is time-consuming, we leverage the Woodbury matrix identity and low-rank approximation tricks to successfully decrease the high computational complexity of computing infinite-order graph convolutions. Extensive experiments on eight public datasets demonstrate that tsGCN achieves superior performance against quite a few state-of-the-art competitors w.r.t. classification tasks. ",

This work is devoted to presenting a critical assessment by systematically examining complex-valued DNNs against their real-valued counterparts. Specifically, we investigate complex-valued DNN atomic units, including linear layers, convolutional layers, long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated linear units. By comparing complex- and real-valued versions of fundamental building blocks in the recently developed gated convolutional recurrent network (GCRN), we show how different mechanisms for basic blocks affect the performance. We also find that the use of complex-valued operations hinders the model capacity when the model size is small. In addition, we examine two recent complex-valued DNNs, i.e. deep complex convolutional recurrent network (DCCRN) and deep complex U-Net (DCUNET). Evaluation results show that both DNNs produce identical performance to their real-valued counterparts while requiring much more computation. Based on these comprehensive comparisons, we conclude that complex-valued DNNs do not provide a performance gain over their real-valued counterparts for monaural speech enhancement, and thus are less desirable due to their higher computational costs.

However, when dynamic motions under constraints are needed and computation time is limited, fast kinodynamic planning on the constraint manifold is indispensable. In recent years, learning-based solutions have become alternatives to classical approaches, but they still lack comprehensive handling of complex constraints, such as planning on a lower-dimensional manifold of the task space while considering the robot's dynamics. This paper introduces a novel learning-to-plan framework that exploits the concept of constraint manifold, including dynamics, and neural planning methods. Our approach generates plans satisfying an arbitrary set of constraints and computes them in a short constant time, namely the inference time of a neural network. This allows the robot to plan and replan reactively, making our approach suitable for dynamic environments. We validate our approach on two simulated tasks and in a demanding real-world scenario, where we use a Kuka LBR Iiwa 14 robotic arm to perform the hitting movement in robotic Air Hockey. ",

It is the continuous path which makes NCDEs be analogues to continuous RNNs. However, NCDEs use existing interpolation algorithms to create the path, which is unclear whether they can create an optimal path. To this end, we present a method to generate another latent path (rather than relying on existing interpolation algorithms), which is identical to learning an appropriate interpolation method.

Existing methods of knowledge distillation are mostly applicable for classification tasks. Many of them also require access to the data used to train the teacher model. To address the problem of knowledge distillation for regression tasks under the absence of original training data, previous work has proposed a data-free knowledge distillation method where synthetic data are generated using a generator model trained adversarially against the student model. These synthetic data and their labels predicted by the teacher model are then used to train the student model. In this study, we investigate the behavior of various synthetic data generation methods and propose a new synthetic data generation strategy that directly optimizes for a large but bounded difference between the student and teacher model. Our results on benchmark and case study experiments demonstrate that the proposed strategy allows the student model to learn better and emulate the performance of the teacher model more closely. ",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of finding an input to a stochastic black box function such that the scalar output of the black box function is as close as possible to a target value in the sense of the expected squared error. While the optimization of stochastic black boxes is classic in (robust) Bayesian optimization, the current approaches based on Gaussian processes predominantly focus either on i) maximization/minimization rather than target value optimization or ii) on the expectation, but not the variance of the output, ignoring output variations due to stochasticity in uncontrollable environmental variables. In this work, we fill this gap and derive acquisition functions for common criteria such as the expected improvement, the probability of improvement, and the lower confidence bound, assuming that aleatoric effects are Gaussian with known variance. Our experiments illustrate that this setting is compatible with certain extensions of Gaussian processes, and show that the thus derived acquisition functions can outperform classical Bayesian optimization even if the latter assumptions are violated. An industrial use case in billet forging is presented. ",

    "abstract": "Language models have demonstrated strong performance on various natural language understanding tasks. Similar to humans, language models could also have their own bias that is learned from the training data. As more and more downstream tasks integrate language models as part of the pipeline, it is necessary to understand the internal stereotypical representation and the methods to mitigate the negative effects. In this paper, we proposed a simple method to test the internal stereotypical representation in pre-trained language models using counterexamples. We mainly focused on gender bias, but the method can be extended to other types of bias. We evaluated models on 9 different cloze-style prompts consisting of knowledge and base prompts. Our results indicate that pre-trained language models show a certain amount of robustness when using unrelated knowledge, and prefer shallow linguistic cues, such as word position and syntactic structure, to alter the internal stereotypical representation. Such findings shed light on how to manipulate language models in a neutral approach for both finetuning and evaluation. ",

    "abstract": "Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) is a navigation task that requires an agent to follow a language instruction in a realistic environment. The understanding of environments is a crucial part of the VLN-CE task, but existing methods are relatively simple and direct in understanding the environment, without delving into the relationship between language instructions and visual environments. Therefore, we propose a new environment representation in order to solve the above problems. First, we propose an Environment Representation Graph (ERG) through object detection to express the environment in semantic level. This operation enhances the relationship between language and environment. Then, the relational representations of object-object, object-agent in ERG are learned through GCN, so as to obtain a continuous expression about ERG. Sequentially, we combine the ERG expression with object label embeddings to obtain the environment representation. Finally, a new cross-modal attention navigation framework is proposed, incorporating our environment representation and a special loss function dedicated to training ERG. Experimental result shows that our method achieves satisfactory performance in terms of success rate on VLN-CE tasks. Further analysis explains that our method attains better cross-modal matching and strong generalization ability. ",

These labeled nodes are selected by exploring the structure of the graph and determining the ability of the nodes to represent the distribution of data within the graph. The DNS algorithm can be applied quite simply on a wide range of semi-supervised graph neural network models for node classification tasks. Through extensive experimentation, we have demonstrated that the incorporation of the DNS algorithm leads to a remarkable improvement in the average accuracy of the model and a significant decrease in the standard deviation, as compared to the original method.

    "abstract": "Logic locking has been a promising solution to many hardware security threats, such as intellectual property infringement and overproduction. Due to the increased attention that threats have received, many efficient specialized attacks against logic locking have been introduced over the years. However, the ability of an adversary to manipulate a locked netlist prior to mounting an attack has not been investigated thoroughly. This paper introduces a resynthesis-based strategy that utilizes the strength of a commercial electronic design automation (EDA) tool to reveal the vulnerabilities of a locked circuit. To do so, in a pre-attack step, a locked netlist is resynthesized using different synthesis parameters in a systematic way, leading to a large number of functionally equivalent but structurally different locked circuits. Then, under the oracle-less threat model, where it is assumed that the adversary only possesses the locked circuit, not the original circuit to query, a prominent attack is applied to these generated netlists collectively, from which a large number of key bits are deciphered. Nevertheless, this paper also describes how the proposed oracle-less attack can be integrated with an oracle-guided attack. The feasibility of the proposed approach is demonstrated for several benchmarks, including remarkable results for breaking a recently proposed provably secure logic locking method and deciphering values of a large number of key bits of the CSAW'19 circuits with very high accuracy.

The answer to this question goes beyond simple predictive performance, and is instead a balance of many factors, including behavioural interpretability and explainability, computational complexity, and data efficiency. There is a growing body of research which attempts to compare the predictive performance of different ML classifiers with classical random utility models. However, existing studies typically analyse only the disaggregate predictive performance, ignoring other aspects affecting model choice. Furthermore, many studies are affected by technical limitations, such as the use of inappropriate validation schemes, incorrect sampling for hierarchical data, lack of external validation, and the exclusive use of discrete metrics. We address these limitations by conducting a systematic comparison of different modelling approaches, across multiple modelling problems, in terms of the key factors likely to affect model choice (out-of-sample predictive performance, accuracy of predicted market shares, extraction of behavioural indicators, and computational efficiency). We combine several real world datasets with synthetic datasets, where the data generation function is known. The results indicate that the models with the highest disaggregate predictive performance (namely extreme gradient boosting and random forests) provide poorer estimates of behavioural indicators and aggregate mode shares, and are more expensive to estimate, than other models, including deep neural networks and Multinomial Logit (MNL). It is further observed that the MNL model performs robustly in a variety of situations, though ML techniques can improve the estimates of behavioural indices such as Willingness to Pay. ",

Uncertainty estimates can be used to quantify the degree of confidence a model has in its predictions and may be valuable for failure detection. We propose a framework of failure detection for motion prediction from the uncertainty perspective, considering both motion uncertainty and model uncertainty, and formulate various uncertainty scores according to different prediction stages. The proposed approach is evaluated based on different motion prediction algorithms, uncertainty estimation methods, uncertainty scores, etc., and the results show that uncertainty is promising for failure detection for motion prediction but should be used with caution.

As such FL systems are exposed to, or indeed the cause of, congestion across a wide set of network resources. Lossy compression can be used to reduce the size of exchanged files and associated delays, at the cost of adding noise to model updates. By judiciously adapting clients' compression to varying network congestion, an FL application can reduce wall clock training time. To that end, we propose a Network Adaptive Compression (NAC-FL) policy, which dynamically varies the client's lossy compression choices to network congestion variations. We prove, under appropriate assumptions, that NAC-FL is asymptotically optimal in terms of directly minimizing the expected wall clock training time. Further, we show via simulation that NAC-FL achieves robust performance improvements with higher gains in settings with positively correlated delays across time. ",

Moreover, most of the previous techniques demand high computational resources, which limits the usage of such systems in resource-constrained settings. To handle these issues, we propose VS-Net, which captures multi-scale spatiotemporal information with the help of dilated depth-wise separable convolution and Approximation Rank Pooling. VS-Net extracts the key features locally from each frame across embedding sub-spaces and forwards the features between adjacent and parallel nodes, enhancing model performance globally. Our model generates saliency maps considering both the background and foreground simultaneously, making it perform better in challenging scenarios. The immense experiments regulated on the benchmark MIDV-500 dataset show that the VS-Net model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both time and robustness measures. ",

Despite the rapid progress, previous works mostly require both positive and negative sample pairs for contrastive clustering, which rely on a relative large batch-size. Moreover, they typically adopt a two-stream architecture with two augmented views, which overlook the possibility and potential benefits of multi-stream architectures (especially with heterogeneous or hybrid networks). In light of this, this paper presents a new end-to-end deep clustering approach termed Heterogeneous Tri-stream Clustering Network (HTCN). The tri-stream architecture in HTCN consists of three main components, including two weight-sharing online networks and a target network, where the parameters of the target network are the exponential moving average of that of the online networks. Notably, the two online networks are trained by simultaneously (i) predicting the instance representations of the target network and (ii) enforcing the consistency between the cluster representations of the target network and that of the two online networks. Experimental results on four challenging image datasets demonstrate the superiority of HTCN over the state-of-the-art deep clustering approaches.

In this work, we propose a novel framework to make long-term predictions by representing the traffic scene in a fixed frame, referred as allo-centric occupancy grid. This allows for the static scene to remain fixed and to represent motion of the ego-vehicle on the grid like other agents'. We study the allo-centric grid prediction with different video prediction networks and validate the approach on the real-world Nuscenes dataset.

Recent approaches mainly focus on the design of view transformation, either pixel-wisely lifting perspective view features into 3D space with estimated depth or grid-wisely constructing BEV features via 3D projection, treating all pixels or grids equally. However, choosing what to transform is also important but has rarely been discussed before. The pixels of a moving car are more informative than the pixels of the sky. To fully utilize the information contained in images, the view transformation should be able to adapt to different image regions according to their contents. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named FrustumFormer, which pays more attention to the features in instance regions via adaptive instance-aware resampling. Specifically, the model obtains instance frustums on the bird's eye view by leveraging image view object proposals. An adaptive occupancy mask within the instance frustum is learned to refine the instance location. Moreover, the temporal frustum intersection could further reduce the localization uncertainty of objects. Comprehensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of FrustumFormer, and we achieve a new state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark. Codes will be released soon. ",

To automatically generate such type of map from a set of images captured by a vehicle, most works formulate this mapping as a segmentation problem, which implies heavy post-processing to obtain the final vectorized representation. Alternative techniques have the ability to generate an HD map in an end-to-end manner but rely on computationally expensive auto-regressive models. To bring camera-based to an applicable level, we propose InstaGraM, a fast end-to-end network generating a vectorized HD map via instance-level graph modeling of the map elements. Our strategy consists of three main stages: top-view feature extraction, road elements' vertices and edges detection, and conversion to a semantic vector representation. After top-down feature extraction, an encoder-decoder architecture is utilized to predict a set of vertices and edge maps of the road elements. Finally, these vertices along with edge maps are associated through an attentional graph neural network generating a semantic vectorized map. Instead of relying on a common segmentation approach, we propose to regress distance transform maps as they provide strong spatial relations and directional information between vertices. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes dataset show that our proposed network outperforms HDMapNet by 13.7 mAP and achieves comparable accuracy with VectorMapNet 5x faster inference speed. ",

This work plans to explore whether the learning process of imputation and prediction could benefit from each other to achieve better outcomes. And the question will be answered by studying the coexistence patterns between missing points and observed ones in incomplete trajectories. More specifically, the proposed model develops an imputation component based on the self-attention mechanism to capture the coexistence patterns between observations and missing points among encoder-decoder layers. Meanwhile, a recurrent unit is integrated to extract the sequential embeddings from newly imputed sequences for predicting the following location. Furthermore, a new implementation called Imputation Cycle is introduced to enable gradual imputation with prediction enhancement at multiple levels, which helps to accelerate the speed of convergence. The experimental results on three different real-world mobility datasets show that the proposed approach has significant advantages over the competitive baselines across both imputation and prediction tasks in terms of accuracy and stability.

BR takes advantage of Vision Transformers in reconstructing missing patches and adopts a grid masking strategy with a masking ratio of 50\\% to reconstruct clean backgrounds without targets. To avoid dividing one target into two neighboring patches, resulting in reconstructing failure, DSW is performed before input embedding. DSW calculates offsets, according to which infrared images dynamically shift. To reduce False Positive (FP) cases caused by regarding reconstruction errors as targets, DH utilizes a structure of densely connected Transformer to further improve the detection performance. Experimental results show that DBR achieves the best F1-score on the two ISTD datasets, MFIRST (64.10\\%) and SIRST (75.01\\%). ",

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing popularity of the stance detection task, existing approaches are predominantly limited to using the textual content of social media posts for the classification, overlooking the social nature of the task. The stance detection task becomes particularly challenging in cross-target classification scenarios, where even in few-shot training settings the model needs to predict the stance towards new targets for which the model has only seen few relevant samples during training. To address the cross-target stance detection in social media by leveraging the social nature of the task, we introduce CT-TN, a novel model that aggregates multimodal embeddings derived from both textual and network features of the data. We conduct experiments in a few-shot cross-target scenario on six different combinations of source-destination target pairs. By comparing CT-TN with state-of-the-art cross-target stance detection models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by achieving average performance improvements ranging from 11% to 21% across different baseline models. Experiments with different numbers of shots show that CT-TN can outperform other models after seeing 300 instances of the destination target. Further, ablation experiments demonstrate the positive contribution of each of the components of CT-TN towards the final performance. We further analyse the network interactions between social media users, which reveal the potential of using social features for cross-target stance detection. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a Universal Defence based on Clustering and Centroids Analysis (CCA-UD) against backdoor attacks. The goal of the proposed defence is to reveal whether a Deep Neural Network model is subject to a backdoor attack by inspecting the training dataset. CCA-UD first clusters the samples of the training set by means of density-based clustering. Then, it applies a novel strategy to detect the presence of poisoned clusters. The proposed strategy is based on a general misclassification behaviour obtained when the features of a representative example of the analysed cluster are added to benign samples. The capability of inducing a misclassification error is a general characteristic of poisoned samples, hence the proposed defence is attack-agnostic. This mask a significant difference with respect to existing defences, that, either can defend against only some types of backdoor attacks, e.g., when the attacker corrupts the label of the poisoned samples, or are effective only when some conditions on the poisoning ratios adopted by the attacker or the kind of triggering pattern used by the attacker are satisfied. Experiments carried out on several classification tasks, considering different types of backdoor attacks and triggering patterns, including both local and global triggers, reveal that the proposed method is very effective to defend against backdoor attacks in all the cases, always outperforming the state of the art techniques.

TrustZone is a hardware-protected Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for ARM processors specifically designed for IoT handheld systems.

In this work, we focus on identifying different vulnerabilities of the TrustZone extension of ARM Cortex-M processors. Then design and implement a threat model to execute those attacks. We have found that TrustZone is vulnerable to buffer overflow-based attacks. We have used this to create an attack called MOFlow and successfully leaked the data of another trusted app. This is done by intentionally overflowing the memory of one app to access the encrypted memory of other apps inside the secure world. We have also found that, by not validating the input parameters in the entry function, TrustZone has exposed a security weakness. We call this Achilles heel and present an attack model showing how to exploit this weakness too. Our proposed novel attacks are implemented and successfully tested on two recent ARM Cortex-M processors available on the market (M23 and M33). ",

Our results demonstrate that multiplicative neural networks can approximate these functions with significantly fewer layers and neurons compared to standard ReLU neural networks, with respect to both input dimension and approximation error. These findings suggest that multiplicative gates can outperform standard feed-forward layers and have potential for improving neural network design. ",

However, investigating the importance and effects of learnable padding methods in deep learning remains relatively open. To mitigate the gap, this paper proposes a novel trainable Padding Module that can be placed in a deep learning model. The Padding Module can optimize itself without requiring or influencing the model's entire loss function. To train itself, the Padding Module constructs a ground truth and a predictor from the inputs by leveraging the underlying structure in the input data for supervision. As a result, the Padding Module can learn automatically to pad pixels to the border of its input images or feature maps. The padding contents are realistic extensions to its input data and simultaneously facilitate the deep learning model's downstream task. Experiments have shown that the proposed Padding Module outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors and the baseline methods. For example, the Padding Module has 1.23% and 0.44% more classification accuracy than the zero padding when tested on the VGG16 and ResNet50. ",

The architecture uses two encoder branches for voxel grids and multi-view images from the same underlying shape. The main idea is to combine a contrastive loss between the resulting latent representations with an additional reconstruction loss. That helps to avoid collapsing the latent representations as a trivial solution for minimizing the contrastive loss. A novel switching scheme is used to cross-train two encoders with a shared decoder. The switching scheme also enables the stop gradient operation on a random branch. Further classification experiments show that the latent representations learned with our self-supervised method integrate more useful information from the additional input data implicitly, thus leading to better reconstruction and classification performance.

Inspired by this intuition, we propose a lightweight model that employs multiple simple heterogeneous decoders and adopts several practical approaches to improve accuracy while keeping computational costs low, such as hierarchical multi-map knowledge distillation, multi-output saliency prediction, unlabeled auxiliary datasets and channel reduction with teacher assistant supervision. Our approach achieves saliency prediction accuracy on par or better than state-of-the-art methods on DFH1K, UCF-Sports and Hollywood2 benchmarks, while enhancing significantly the efficiency of the model.

Recent works make it possible to improve representational capabilities by using hypercomplex-inspired networks which consume high computational costs.

Also, we use 5D parameterized hypercomplex multiplication based fully connected layers. Incorporating both yields our proposed hypercomplex network, a novel architecture that can be assembled to construct deep axial-hypercomplex networks (DANs) for image classifications.

FL algorithms (like FedAvg) iteratively aggregate model updates computed by clients on their own datasets. Clients may exhibit different levels of participation, often correlated over time and with other clients. This paper presents the first convergence analysis for a FedAvg-like FL algorithm under heterogeneous and correlated client availability. Our analysis highlights how correlation adversely affects the algorithm's convergence rate and how the aggregation strategy can alleviate this effect at the cost of steering training toward a biased model. Guided by the theoretical analysis, we propose CA-Fed, a new FL algorithm that tries to balance the conflicting goals of maximizing convergence speed and minimizing model bias. To this purpose, CA-Fed dynamically adapts the weight given to each client and may ignore clients with low availability and large correlation. Our experimental results show that CA-Fed achieves higher time-average accuracy and a lower standard deviation than state-of-the-art AdaFed and F3AST, both on synthetic and real datasets. ",

In this study, we extract a sub-network of \\textit{Pseudomonas aeruginosa} GRN that is associated with one virulence factor: pyocyanin production as a use case to investigate the GRNN behaviors. Further, using Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture, we model a single species biofilm to reveal the role of GRNN dynamics on ecosystem-wide decision-making. Varying environmental conditions, we prove that the extracted GRNN computes input signals similar to natural decision-making process of the cell. Identifying of neural network behaviors in GRNs may lead to more accurate bacterial cell activity predictive models for many applications, including human health-related problems and agricultural applications.
