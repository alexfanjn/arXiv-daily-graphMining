    "abstract": "An effective framework for learning 3D representations for perception tasks is distilling rich self-supervised image features via contrastive learning. However, image-to point representation learning for autonomous driving datasets faces two main challenges: 1) the abundance of self-similarity, which results in the contrastive losses pushing away semantically similar point and image regions and thus disturbing the local semantic structure of the learned representations, and 2) severe class imbalance as pretraining gets dominated by over-represented classes. We propose to alleviate the self-similarity problem through a novel semantically tolerant image-to-point contrastive loss that takes into consideration the semantic distance between positive and negative image regions to minimize contrasting semantically similar point and image regions. Additionally, we address class imbalance by designing a class-agnostic balanced loss that approximates the degree of class imbalance through an aggregate sample-to-samples semantic similarity measure. We demonstrate that our semantically-tolerant contrastive loss with class balancing improves state-of-the art 2D-to-3D representation learning in all evaluation settings on 3D semantic segmentation. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D representation learning frameworks across a wide range of 2D self-supervised pretrained models. ",

    "abstract": "The recent trend for multi-camera 3D object detection is through the unified bird's-eye view (BEV) representation. However, directly transforming features extracted from the image-plane view to BEV inevitably results in feature distortion, especially around the objects of interest, making the objects blur into the background. To this end, we propose OA-BEV, a network that can be plugged into the BEV-based 3D object detection framework to bring out the objects by incorporating object-aware pseudo-3D features and depth features. Such features contain information about the object's position and 3D structures. First, we explicitly guide the network to learn the depth distribution by object-level supervision from each 3D object's center. Then, we select the foreground pixels by a 2D object detector and project them into 3D space for pseudo-voxel feature encoding. Finally, the object-aware depth features and pseudo-voxel features are incorporated into the BEV representation with a deformable attention mechanism. We conduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset to validate the merits of our proposed OA-BEV. Our method achieves consistent improvements over the BEV-based baselines in terms of both average precision and nuScenes detection score. Our codes will be published. ",

    "abstract": "Deep supervised learning algorithms generally require large numbers of labeled examples to attain satisfactory performance. To avoid the expensive cost incurred by collecting and labeling too many examples, as a subset of unsupervised learning, self-supervised learning (SSL) was proposed to learn good features from many unlabeled examples without any human-annotated labels. SSL has recently become a hot research topic, and many related algorithms have been proposed. However, few comprehensive studies have explained the connections among different SSL variants and how they have evolved. In this paper, we attempt to provide a review of the various SSL methods from the perspectives of algorithms, theory, applications, three main trends, and open questions. First, the motivations of most SSL algorithms are introduced in detail, and their commonalities and differences are compared. Second, the theoretical issues associated with SSL are investigated. Third, typical applications of SSL in areas such as image processing and computer vision (CV), as well as natural language processing (NLP), are discussed. Finally, the three main trends of SSL and the open research questions are discussed. A collection of useful materials is available at https://github.com/guijiejie/SSL. ",

    "abstract": "The eco-toll estimation problem quantifies the expected environmental cost (e.g., energy consumption, exhaust emissions) for a vehicle to travel along a path. This problem is important for societal applications such as eco-routing, which aims to find paths with the lowest exhaust emissions or energy need. The challenges of this problem are three-fold: (1) the dependence of a vehicle's eco-toll on its physical parameters; (2) the lack of access to data with eco-toll information; and (3) the influence of contextual information (i.e. the connections of adjacent segments in the path) on the eco-toll of road segments. Prior work on eco-toll estimation has mostly relied on pure data-driven approaches and has high estimation errors given the limited training data. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Eco-toll estimation Physics-informed Neural Network framework (Eco-PiNN) using three novel ideas, namely, (1) a physics-informed decoder that integrates the physical laws of the vehicle engine into the network, (2) an attention-based contextual information encoder, and (3) a physics-informed regularization to reduce overfitting. Experiments on real-world heavy-duty truck data show that the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy of eco-toll estimation compared with state-of-the-art methods. ",

Examples come from internet graphs, social networks, genomics and proteomics, and other sources. The typically large size of such data motivates seeking efficient ways for its compression and decompression. The current compression methods are usually tailored to specific models, or do not provide theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we introduce a low-complexity lossless compression algorithm for sparse marked graphs, i.e. graphical data indexed by sparse graphs, which is capable of universally achieving the optimal compression rate in a precisely defined sense. In order to define universality, we employ the framework of local weak convergence, which allows one to make sense of a notion of stochastic processes for sparse graphs. Moreover, we investigate the performance of our algorithm through some experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data. ",

Here, we present a network-growth method that searches for explainable error in the network's residuals and grows the network if sufficient error is detected. We demonstrate this method using examples from classification, imitation learning, and reinforcement learning. Within these tasks, the growing network can often achieve better performance than small networks that do not grow, and similar performance to networks that begin much larger. ",

These datacenters rely on optical switches which can be reconfigured to provide direct connectivity between racks, in the form of edge-disjoint matchings. While state-of-the-art optical switches in principle support microsecond reconfigurations, the demand-aware topology optimization constitutes a bottleneck. This paper proposes a dynamic algorithms approach to improve the performance of reconfigurable datacenter networks, by supporting faster reactions to changes in the traffic demand. This approach leverages the temporal locality of traffic patterns in order to update the interconnecting matchings incrementally, rather than recomputing them from scratch. In particular, we present six (batch-)dynamic algorithms and compare them to static ones. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on 176 synthetic and 39 real-world traces, and find that dynamic algorithms can both significantly improve the running time and reduce the number of changes to the configuration, especially in networks with high temporal locality, while retaining matching weight.

However, various traffic signs in a driving scene have an unequal impact on the driver's decisions, making detecting the salient traffic signs a more important task. Our research addresses this issue, constructing a traffic sign detection model which emphasizes performance on salient signs, or signs that influence the decisions of a driver. We define a traffic sign salience property and use it to construct the LAVA Salient Signs Dataset, the first traffic sign dataset that includes an annotated salience property. Next, we use a custom salience loss function, Salience-Sensitive Focal Loss, to train a Deformable DETR object detection model in order to emphasize stronger performance on salient signs. Results show that a model trained with Salience-Sensitive Focal Loss outperforms a model trained without, with regards to recall of both salient signs and all signs combined. Further, the performance margin on salient signs compared to all signs is largest for the model trained with Salience-Sensitive Focal Loss. ",

Our approach is fully unsupervised and can lead to high-quality correspondences even in challenging cases such as sparse point clouds or non-isometric meshes, where current methods fail. Our first key observation is that, in line with neural priors observed in other domains, recent network architectures on 3D data, even without training, tend to produce pointwise features that induce plausible maps between rigid or non-rigid shapes. Secondly, we show that given a noisy map as input, training a feature extraction network with the input map as supervision tends to remove artifacts from the input and can act as a powerful correspondence denoising mechanism, both between individual pairs and within a collection. With these observations in hand, we propose a two-stage unsupervised paradigm for shape matching by (i) performing unsupervised training by adapting an existing approach to obtain an initial set of noisy matches, and (ii) using these matches to train a network in a supervised manner. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the accuracy of the maps, especially when trained within a collection.

These models are often supervised in nature and using the property-specific training data, learn relationship between crystal structure and different properties like formation energy, bandgap, bulk modulus, etc. Most of these methods require a huge amount of property-tagged data to train the system which may not be available for different properties. However, there is an availability of a huge amount of crystal data with its chemical composition and structural bonds. To leverage these untapped data, this paper presents CrysGNN, a new pre-trained GNN framework for crystalline materials, which captures both node and graph level structural information of crystal graphs using a huge amount of unlabelled material data. Further, we extract distilled knowledge from CrysGNN and inject into different state of the art property predictors to enhance their property prediction accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments to show that with distilled knowledge from the pre-trained model, all the SOTA algorithms are able to outperform their own vanilla version with good margins. We also observe that the distillation process provides a significant improvement over the conventional approach of finetuning the pre-trained model. We have released the pre-trained model along with the large dataset of 800K crystal graph which we carefully curated; so that the pretrained model can be plugged into any existing and upcoming models to enhance their prediction accuracy.

    "abstract": "Label assignment is often employed in recent convolutional neural network (CNN) based detectors to determine positive or negative samples during training process. However, we note that current label assignment strategies barely consider the characteristics of targets in remote sensing images thoroughly, such as large variations in orientations, aspect ratios and scales, which lead to insufficient sampling. In this paper, an Elliptical Distribution aided Adaptive Rotation Label Assignment (EARL) is proposed to select positive samples with higher quality in orientation detectors, and yields better performance. Concretely, to avoid inadequate sampling of targets with extreme scales, an adaptive scale sampling (ADS) strategy is proposed to dynamically select samples on different feature levels according to the scales of targets. To enhance ADS, positive samples are selected following a dynamic elliptical distribution (DED), which can further exploit the orientation and shape properties of targets. Moreover, a spatial distance weighting (SDW) module is introduced to mitigate the influence from low-quality samples on detection performance. Extensive experiments on popular remote sensing datasets, such as DOTA and HRSC2016, demonstrate the effectiveness and the superiority of our proposed EARL, where without bells and whistles, it achieves 72.87 of mAP on DOTA dataset by being integrated with simple structure, which outperforms current state-of-the-art anchor-free detectors and provides comparable performance as anchor-based methods.

Specifically, we remove and correct errors in the labels progressively by iterative multi-view voting and entropy ranking. At each time step, we first divide the training data into disjoint parts for separate training and voting. The unanimity in the voting reveals the correctness of the labels, so that we can train a strong model with only the images with unanimous votes. In addition, we adopt entropy as an effective measure for prediction uncertainty, in order to partially recover labeling errors by ranking and selection. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on the WHU-RS19 dataset and the AID dataset. ",

However, relying solely on rotation as a self-supervised transformation can limit the ability of the model to learn rich features from the data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to self-supervised learning for image classification using several localizable augmentations with the combination of the gating method. Our approach uses flip and shuffle channel augmentations in addition to the rotation, allowing the model to learn rich features from the data. Furthermore, the gated mixture network is used to weigh the effects of each self-supervised learning on the loss function, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant transformations for classification.

However, previous methods estimate the target depth map and camera ego-motion simultaneously, underusing multi-frame correlation information and ignoring the motion of dynamic objects. In this paper, we propose a novel Dyna-Depthformer framework, which predicts scene depth and 3D motion field jointly and aggregates multi-frame information with transformer. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we leverage multi-view correlation through a series of self- and cross-attention layers in order to obtain enhanced depth feature representation. Specifically, we use the perspective transformation to acquire the initial reference point, and use deformable attention to reduce the computational cost. Second, we propose a warping-based Motion Network to estimate the motion field of dynamic objects without using semantic prior. To improve the motion field predictions, we propose an iterative optimization strategy, together with a sparsity-regularized loss. The entire pipeline achieves end-to-end self-supervised training by constructing a minimum reprojection loss. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Cityscapes benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. ",

There are fewer studies about the resilience of these models when they are trained on image datasets that suffer modifications altering their original quality. Yet this is a common problem that is often encountered in the industry. A good example of that is with earth observation satellites that are capturing many images. The energy and time of connection to the earth of an orbiting satellite are limited and must be carefully used. An approach to mitigate that is to compress the images on board before downloading. The compression can be regulated depending on the intended usage of the image and the requirements of this application. We present a new software tool with the name iquaflow that is designed to study image quality and model performance variation given an alteration of the image dataset. Furthermore, we do a showcase study about oriented object detection models adoption on a public image dataset DOTA Xia_2018_CVPR given different compression levels. The optimal compression point is found and the usefulness of iquaflow becomes evident. ",

First, the mathematical models of the static and eigenproblems are formulated in great detail. The FG material properties are assumed to vary smoothly and continuously throughout three directions of the plate according to a Mori-Tanaka micromechanics model distribution of volume fraction of constituents. Then, finite element analysis (FEA) with mixed interpolation of tensorial components of 4-nodes (MITC4) is implemented in order to eliminate theoretically a shear locking phenomenon existing. Next, influences of the variable thickness functions (uniform, non-uniform linear, and non-uniform non-linear), material properties, length-to-thickness ratio, boundary conditions, and elastic parameters on the plate response are investigated and discussed in detail through several numerical examples. Finally, a deep neural network (DNN) technique using batch normalization (BN) is learned to predict the non-dimensional values of multi-directional FG plates. The DNN model also shows that it is a powerful technique capable of handling an extensive database and different vital parameters in engineering applications. ",

In this paper, we comprehensively survey these EEMs published up to date, and provide a detailed analysis to motivate the further development of this research direction. Specifically, we divide the existing EEMs into four categories based on the number of DNNs trained for constructing these EEMs. The categorization can reflect the degree of efficiency in principle, which can in turn help quickly grasp the methodological features. In surveying each category, we further discuss the design principles and analyze the strength and weaknesses to clarify the landscape of existing EEMs, thus making easily understanding the research trends of EEMs. Furthermore, we also discuss the current challenges and issues to identify future research directions in this emerging topic.

    "abstract": "Drug combination therapy is a well-established strategy for disease treatment with better effectiveness and less safety degradation. However, identifying novel drug combinations through wet-lab experiments is resource intensive due to the vast combinatorial search space. Recently, computational approaches, specifically deep learning models have emerged as an efficient way to discover synergistic combinations. While previous methods reported fair performance, their models usually do not take advantage of multi-modal data and they are unable to handle new drugs or cell lines. In this study, we collected data from various datasets covering various drug-related aspects. Then, we take advantage of large-scale pre-training models to generate informative representations and features for drugs, proteins, and diseases. Based on that, a message-passing graph is built on top to propagate information together with graph structure learning flexibility. This is first introduced in the biological networks and enables us to generate pseudo-relations in the graph. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results in comparison with other deep learning-based methods on synergistic prediction benchmark datasets. We are also capable of inferencing new drug combination data in a test on an independent set released by AstraZeneca, where 10% of improvement over previous methods is observed. In addition, we're robust against unseen drugs and surpass almost 15% AU ROC compared to the second-best model. We believe our framework contributes to both the future wet-lab discovery of novel drugs and the building of promising guidance for precise combination medicine. ",

On the other hand, we have yet to see VR parallels for many privacy-preserving tools aimed at mitigating threats on conventional platforms. This paper aims to systematize knowledge on the landscape of VR privacy threats and countermeasures by proposing a comprehensive taxonomy of data attributes, protections, and adversaries based on the study of 68 collected publications. We complement our qualitative discussion with a statistical analysis of the risk associated with various data sources inherent to VR in consideration of the known attacks and defenses.

In this paper, we study the spatial disequilibrium problem of modern object detectors and propose to quantify this ``spatial bias'' by measuring the detection performance over zones. Our analysis surprisingly shows that the spatial imbalance of objects has a great impact on the detection performance, limiting the robustness of detection applications. This motivates us to design a more generalized measurement, termed Spatial equilibrium Precision (SP), to better characterize the detection performance of object detectors. Furthermore, we also present a spatial equilibrium label assignment (SELA) to alleviate the spatial disequilibrium problem by injecting the prior spatial weight into the optimization process of detectors. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC, MS COCO, and 3 application datasets on face mask/fruit/helmet images demonstrate the advantages of our method. Our findings challenge the conventional sense of object detectors and show the indispensability of spatial equilibrium.

We adapted an experimental paradigm designed for studying complex choices in such contexts. We show that framing and anchoring effects impact how people work with an AI helper and are predictive of choice outcomes. The evidence suggests that some participants, particularly those in a loss frame, put too much faith in the AI helper and experienced worse choice outcomes by doing so. The paradigm also generates computational modeling-friendly data allowing future studies of human-AI decision making. ",

So far, the detection of sperms and impurities still largely relies on the traditional image processing and detection techniques which only yield limited performance and often require manual intervention in the detection process, therefore unfavorably escalating the time cost and injecting the subjective bias into the analysis. Encouraged by the successes of deep learning methods in numerous object detection tasks, here we report a deep learning model based on Double Branch Feature Extraction Network (DBFEN) and Cross-conjugate Feature Pyramid Networks (CCFPN).DBFEN is designed to extract visual features from tiny objects with a double branch structure, and CCFPN is further introduced to fuse the features extracted by DBFEN to enhance the description of position and high-level semantic information. Our work is the pioneer of introducing deep learning approaches to the detection of sperms and impurities. Experiments show that the highest AP50 of the sperm and impurity detection is 91.13% and 59.64%, which lead its competitors by a substantial margin and establish new state-of-the-art results in this problem.

    "title": "Rationalizing Predictions by Adversarial Information Calibration",
    "abstract": "Explaining the predictions of AI models is paramount in safety-critical applications, such as in legal or medical domains. One form of explanation for a prediction is an extractive rationale, i.e., a subset of features of an instance that lead the model to give its prediction on that instance. For example, the subphrase ``he stole the mobile phone'' can be an extractive rationale for the prediction of ``Theft''. Previous works on generating extractive rationales usually employ a two-phase model: a selector that selects the most important features (i.e., the rationale) followed by a predictor that makes the prediction based exclusively on the selected features. One disadvantage of these works is that the main signal for learning to select features comes from the comparison of the answers given by the predictor to the ground-truth answers. In this work, we propose to squeeze more information from the predictor via an information calibration method. More precisely, we train two models jointly: one is a typical neural model that solves the task at hand in an accurate but black-box manner, and the other is a selector-predictor model that additionally produces a rationale for its prediction. The first model is used as a guide for the second model. We use an adversarial technique to calibrate the information extracted by the two models such that the difference between them is an indicator of the missed or over-selected features. In addition, for natural language tasks, we propose a language-model-based regularizer to encourage the extraction of fluent rationales. Experimental results on a sentiment analysis task, a hate speech recognition task as well as on three tasks from the legal domain show the effectiveness of our approach to rationale extraction. ",

We target two research areas of interest: Gaussian graphical models for tensor-variate data and summarization of complex time-varying texts using topic models. This work advances the state-of-the-art in several directions. First, it introduces a new class of tensor-variate Gaussian graphical models via the Sylvester tensor equation. Second, it develops an optimization technique based on a fast-converging proximal alternating linearized minimization method, which scales tensor-variate Gaussian graphical model estimations to modern big-data settings. Third, it connects Kronecker-structured (inverse) covariance models with spatio-temporal partial differential equations (PDEs) and introduces a new framework for ensemble Kalman filtering that is capable of tracking chaotic physical systems. Fourth, it proposes a modular and interpretable framework for unsupervised and weakly-supervised probabilistic topic modeling of time-varying data that combines generative statistical models with computational geometric methods. Throughout, practical applications of the methodology are considered using real datasets. This includes brain-connectivity analysis using EEG data, space weather forecasting using solar imaging data, longitudinal analysis of public opinions using Twitter data, and mining of mental health related issues using TalkLife data. We show in each case that the graphical modeling framework introduced here leads to improved interpretability, accuracy, and scalability. ",

This trend is anticipated to continue in the next few years. Given their high share of generation in power systems, detecting malfunctions and abnormalities in rooftop PV systems is essential for ensuring their high efficiency and safety. In this paper, we present a novel anomaly detection method for a large number of rooftop PV systems installed in a region using big data and a time series complexity measure called weighted permutation entropy (WPE). This efficient method only uses the historical PV generation data in a given region to identify anomalous PV systems and requires no new sensor or smart device. Using a real-world PV generation dataset, we discuss how the hyperparameters of WPE should be tuned for the purpose. The proposed PV anomaly detection method is then tested on rooftop PV generation data from over 100 South Australian households. The results demonstrate that anomalous systems detected by our method have indeed encountered problems and require a close inspection. The detection and resolution of potential faults would result in better rooftop PV systems, longer lifetimes, and higher returns on investment. ",

    "abstract": "It is critical for infrastructure manager to keep the status high-quality for providing the service to users at daily activities. Using surveillance cameras and drone inspection toward the damage feature, there has been progress to automate its inspection toward the grade of health condition whether the deterioration has been changed or not. When we prepare a pair of raw images and damage class labels, it is possible to train supervised learning toward the predefined damage grade, displacement. However, such a damage representation does not always match the predefined classes of damage grade, so there may be some detailed clusters from unseen damage space, or more complex clusters from overlapped space between two damage grades. The damage representation has fundamentally complex feature, so all the damage classes could not be perfectly predefined. Our proposed MN-pair contrastive learning method enable to explore the embedding damage representation beyond the predefined classes including more detailed clusters. This method intends to maximize the similarity of M-1 positive images close to the anchor, and simultaneously to maximize the dissimilarity N-1 negative ones far apart, using both weighting loss function. This MN-pair method has been faster learning than the N-pair algorithm, instead of using one positive image. We propose a pipeline to learn the damage representation and to automate to discriminate more detailed clusters using the density based clustering on the embedding 2-D reduction space. We also visualize the explanation of damage feature using Grad-CAM for MN-pair damage metric learning. We demonstrate our method to three experimental studies such as steel product defect, concrete crack of deck and pavement, and sewer pipe defect. Furthermore, we mention the usefulness of our method and future works to tackle. ",

What is even more interesting is that humans tend to remember and forget the same things, suggesting that there might be some general internal characteristics of an image to encode and discard similar types of information. Research suggests that some pictures tend to be memorized more than others. The ability of an image to be remembered by different viewers is one of its intrinsic properties. In visualization and photography, creating memorable images is a difficult task. Hence, to solve the problem, various techniques predict visual memorability and manipulate images' memorability. We present a comprehensive literature survey to assess the deep learning techniques used to predict and modify memorability. In particular, we analyze the use of Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Generative Adversarial Networks for image memorability prediction and modification. ",

    "abstract": "Classical adversarial attacks for Face Recognition (FR) models typically generate discrete examples for target identity with a single state image. However, such paradigm of point-wise attack exhibits poor generalization against numerous unknown states of identity and can be easily defended. In this paper, by rethinking the inherent relationship between the face of target identity and its variants, we introduce a new pipeline of Generalized Manifold Adversarial Attack (GMAA) to achieve a better attack performance by expanding the attack range. Specifically, this expansion lies on two aspects - GMAA not only expands the target to be attacked from one to many to encourage a good generalization ability for the generated adversarial examples, but it also expands the latter from discrete points to manifold by leveraging the domain knowledge that face expression change can be continuous, which enhances the attack effect as a data augmentation mechanism did. Moreover, we further design a dual supervision with local and global constraints as a minor contribution to improve the visual quality of the generated adversarial examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method based on extensive experiments, and reveal that GMAA promises a semantic continuous adversarial space with a higher generalization ability and visual quality ",

    "abstract": "With the rapid acceleration of transportation electrification, public charging stations are becoming vital infrastructure in a smart sustainable city to provide on-demand electric vehicle (EV) charging services. As more consumers seek to utilize public charging services, the pricing and scheduling of such services will become vital, complementary tools to mediate competition for charging resources. However, determining the right prices to charge is difficult due to the online nature of EV arrivals. This paper studies a joint pricing and scheduling problem for the operator of EV charging networks with limited charging capacity and time-varying energy cost. Upon receiving a charging request, the operator offers a price, and the EV decides whether to admit the offer based on its own value and the posted price. The operator then schedules the real-time charging process to satisfy the charging request if the EV admits the offer. We propose an online pricing algorithm that can determine the posted price and EV charging schedule to maximize social welfare, i.e., the total value of EVs minus the energy cost of charging stations. Theoretically, we prove the devised algorithm can achieve the order-optimal competitive ratio under the competitive analysis framework. Practically, we show the empirical performance of our algorithm outperforms other benchmark algorithms in experiments using real EV charging data. ",

Typically, a learnable transformation (i.e. the classifier) is placed at the end of such models returning class scores that are further normalized into probabilities by Softmax.

In this work we show how to extract from CNNs features with the properties of \\emph{maximum} inter-class separability and \\emph{maximum} intra-class compactness by setting the parameters of the classifier transformation as not trainable (i.e. fixed). We obtain features similar to what can be obtained with the well-known ``Center Loss'' \\cite{wen2016discriminative} and other similar approaches but with several practical advantages including maximal exploitation of the available feature space representation, reduction in the number of network parameters, no need to use other auxiliary losses besides the Softmax. Our approach unifies and generalizes into a common approach two apparently different classes of methods regarding: discriminative features, pioneered by the Center Loss \\cite{wen2016discriminative} and fixed classifiers, firstly evaluated in \\cite{hoffer2018fix}.

To be specific, based on the theoretical formulation that feature diversity is correlated with the rank of the unfolded kernel matrix, we rectify 3D convolution by modifying its topology to boost the rank upper-bound, yielding a rank-enhanced spatial-spectral symmetrical convolution set (ReS$^3$-ConvSet), which is able to not only learn diverse and powerful feature representations but also save network parameters. In addition, we also propose a novel diversity-aware regularization (DA-Reg) term, which acts directly on the feature maps to maximize the independence among elements. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ReS$^3$-ConvSet and DA-Reg, we apply them to various HS image processing and analysis tasks, including denoising, spatial super-resolution, and classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches outperform state-of-the-art methods to a significant extent both quantitatively and qualitatively.

We investigate the quantitative reachability analysis of probabilistic programs and stochastic systems, which is the problem of computing the probability of hitting in finite time a given target set of states. This general problem subsumes a wide variety of other quantitative verification problems, from the invariant and the safety analysis of discrete-time stochastic systems to the assertion-violation and the termination analysis of single-loop probabilistic programs. We exploit the expressive power of neural networks as novel templates for indicating supermartingale functions, which provide general certificates of reachability that are both tight and sound. Our method uses machine learning to train a neural certificate that minimises an upper bound for the probability of reachability over sampled observations of the state space. Then, it uses satisfiability modulo theories to verify that the obtained neural certificate is valid over every possible state of the program and conversely, upon receiving a counterexample, it refines neural training in a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis loop, until the solver confirms the certificate. We experimentally demonstrate on a diverse set of benchmark probabilistic programs and stochastic dynamical models that neural indicating supermartingales yield smaller or comparable probability bounds than existing state-of-the-art methods in all cases, and further that the approach succeeds on models that are entirely beyond the reach of such alternative techniques.

Despite the large number of methods that have been put forth to extract the main topics of texts, a limited number of studies have probed the impact of the text length on the performance of keyword extraction (KE) methods. In this study, we adopted a network-based approach to evaluate whether keywords extracted from paper abstracts are compatible with keywords extracted from full papers. We employed a community detection method to identify groups of related papers in citation networks. These paper clusters were then employed to extract keywords from abstracts. Our results indicate that while the various community detection methods employed in our KE approach yielded similar levels of accuracy, a correlation analysis revealed that these methods produced distinct keyword lists for each abstract. We also observed that all considered approaches, however, reach low values of accuracy. Surprisingly, text clustering approaches outperformed all citation-based methods. The findings suggest that using different sources of information to extract keywords can lead to significant differences in performance. This effect can play an important role in applications relying upon the identification of relevant concepts. ",

IIoT brings the physical and digital environment together with minimal human intervention and profoundly transforms the economy and modern business. Data flowing through IIoT feed artificial intelligence tools, which perform intelligent functions such as performance tuning of interconnected machines, error correction, and preventive maintenance. However, IIoT deployments are vulnerable to sophisticated security threats at various levels of the connectivity and communications infrastructure they incorporate. The complex and often heterogeneous nature of chaotic IIoT infrastructures means that availability, confidentiality and integrity are difficult to guarantee. This can lead to potential mistrust of network operations, concerns about privacy breaches or loss of vital personal data and sensitive information of network end-users. This paper examines the privacy requirements of an IIoT ecosystem in industry standards. Specifically, it describes the industry privacy dimensions of the protection of natural persons through the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties. In addition, it presents an overview of the state-of-the-art methodologies and solutions for industrial privacy threats.

    "abstract": "Hyperledger Fabric is a popular permissioned blockchain system that features a highly modular and extensible system for deploying permissioned blockchains which are expected to have a major effect on a wide range of sectors. Unlike traditional blockchain systems such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric uses the EOV model for transaction processing: the submitted transactions are executed by the endorsing peer, ordered and batched by the ordering services, and validated by the validating peers. Due to this EOV workflow, a well-documented issue that arises is the multi-version concurrency control conflict. This happens when two transactions try to writes and read the same key in the ledger at the same time. Existing solutions to address this problem includes eliminating blocks in favor of streaming transactions, repairing conflicts during the ordering phase, and automatically merging the conflicting transactions using CRDT (Conflict Free Replicated Data) techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel solution called Early Detection for MVCC Conflicts. Our solution detects the conflicting transactions at an early stage of the transaction execution instead of processing them until the validation phase to be aborted. The advantage of our solution is that it detects conflict as soon as possible to minimize the overhead of conflicting transaction on the network resulting in the reduction of the end-to-end transaction latency and the increase of the system's effective throughput. We have successfully implemented our solution in Hyperledger Fabric. We propose three different implementations which realize early detection. Our results show that our solutions all perform better than the baseline Fabric, with our best solution SyncMap which improves the goodput by up to 23% and reduces the latency by up to 80%. ",

    "abstract": "Improving the predictive capability and computational cost of dynamical models is often at the heart of augmenting computational physics with machine learning (ML). However, most learning results are limited in interpretability and generalization over different computational grid resolutions, initial and boundary conditions, domain geometries, and physical or problem-specific parameters. In the present study, we simultaneously address all these challenges by developing the novel and versatile methodology of unified neural partial delay differential equations. We augment existing/low-fidelity dynamical models directly in their partial differential equation (PDE) forms with both Markovian and non-Markovian neural network (NN) closure parameterizations. The melding of the existing models with NNs in the continuous spatiotemporal space followed by numerical discretization automatically allows for the desired generalizability. The Markovian term is designed to enable extraction of its analytical form and thus provides interpretability. The non-Markovian terms allow accounting for inherently missing time delays needed to represent the real world. We obtain adjoint PDEs in the continuous form, thus enabling direct implementation across differentiable and non-differentiable computational physics codes, different ML frameworks, and treatment of nonuniformly-spaced spatiotemporal training data. We demonstrate the new generalized neural closure models (gnCMs) framework using four sets of experiments based on advecting nonlinear waves, shocks, and ocean acidification models. Our learned gnCMs discover missing physics, find leading numerical error terms, discriminate among candidate functional forms in an interpretable fashion, achieve generalization, and compensate for the lack of complexity in simpler models. Finally, we analyze the computational advantages of our new framework. ",

It binds a data entry with a membership configuration profile that describes responsible vehicles for achieving consensus for the data entry. As such, V-Guard produces chained consensus results of both data entries and their residing membership profiles, which enables consensus to be achieved seamlessly under changing memberships. In addition, V-Guard separates the ordering of transactions from consensus, allowing concurrent ordering instances and periodic consensus instances to order and commit data entries.

Several solutions employ Searchable Encryption (SE) to achieve secure alerts directly on encrypted locations. While doing so preserves privacy, the performance overhead incurred is high. We focus on a prominent SE technique in the public-key setting -- Hidden Vector Encryption (HVE), and propose a graph embedding technique to encode location data in a way that significantly boosts the performance of processing on ciphertexts. We show that finding the optimal encoding is NP-hard, and provide several heuristics that are fast and obtain significant performance gains. Furthermore, we investigate the more challenging case of dynamic alert zones, where the area of interest changes over time.

In this paper, we propose a novel model backdoor forensics technique. Given a few attack samples such as inputs with backdoor triggers, which may represent different types of backdoors, our technique automatically decomposes them to clean inputs and the corresponding triggers. It then clusters the triggers based on their properties to allow automatic attack categorization and summarization. Backdoor scanners can then be automatically synthesized to find other instances of the same type of backdoor in other models. Our evaluation on 2,532 pre-trained models, 10 popular attacks, and comparison with 9 baselines show that our technique is highly effective. The decomposed clean inputs and triggers closely resemble the ground truth. The synthesized scanners substantially outperform the vanilla versions of existing scanners that can hardly generalize to different kinds of attacks. ",

    "abstract": "The last few decades have witnessed an emerging trend of wearable soft sensors; however, there are important signal-processing challenges for soft sensors that still limit their practical deployment. They are error-prone when displaced, resulting in significant deviations from their ideal sensor output. In this work, we propose a novel prototype that integrates an elbow pad with a sparse network of soft sensors. Our prototype is fully bio-compatible, stretchable, and wearable. We develop a learning-based method to predict the elbow orientation angle and achieve an average tracking error of 9.82 degrees for single-user multi-motion experiments. With transfer learning, our method achieves the average tracking errors of 10.98 degrees and 11.81 degrees across different motion types and users, respectively. Our core contributions lie in a solution that realizes robust and stable human joint motion tracking across different device displacements. ",

    "abstract": "Graph entity dependencies (GEDs) are novel graph constraints, unifying keys and functional dependencies, for property graphs. They have been found useful in many real-world data quality and data management tasks, including fact checking on social media networks and entity resolution. In this paper, we study the discovery problem of GEDs -- finding a minimal cover of valid GEDs in a given graph data. We formalise the problem, and propose an effective and efficient approach to overcome major bottlenecks in GED discovery. In particular, we leverage existing graph partitioning algorithms to enable fast GED-scope discovery, and employ effective pruning strategies over the prohibitively large space of candidate dependencies. Furthermore, we define an interestingness measure for GEDs based on the minimum description length principle, to score and rank the mined cover set of GEDs. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our GED discovery approach through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark graph data sets; and present the usefulness of the discovered rules in different downstream data quality management applications.

    "abstract": "As one of the most popular GNN architectures, the graph attention networks (GAT) is considered the most advanced learning architecture for graph representation and has been widely used in various graph mining tasks with impressive results. However, since GAT was proposed, none of the existing studies have provided systematic insight into the relationship between the performance of GAT and the number of layers, which is a critical issue in guiding model performance improvement. In this paper, we perform a systematic experimental evaluation and based on the experimental results, we find two important facts: (1) the main factor limiting the accuracy of the GAT model as the number of layers increases is the oversquashing phenomenon; (2) among the previous improvements applied to the GNN model, only the residual connection can significantly improve the GAT model performance. We combine these two important findings to provide a theoretical explanation that it is the residual connection that mitigates the loss of original feature information due to oversquashing and thus improves the deep GAT model performance. This provides empirical insights and guidelines for researchers to design the GAT variant model with appropriate depth and well performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidelines, we propose a GAT variant model-ADGAT that adaptively selects the number of layers based on the sparsity of the graph, and experimentally demonstrate that the effectiveness of our model is significantly improved over the original GAT.

While RGNNs have been increasingly adopted in many real-world applications due to their versatility and accuracy, they pose performance and system design challenges due to their inherent computation patterns, gap between the programming interface and kernel APIs, and heavy programming efforts in optimizing kernels caused by their coupling with data layout and heterogeneity. To systematically address these challenges, we propose Pigeon, a novel two-level intermediate representation (IR) and its code generator framework, that (a) represents the key properties of the RGNN models to bridge the gap between the programming interface and kernel APIs, (b) decouples model semantics, data layout, and operators-specific optimization from each other to reduce programming efforts, (c) expresses and leverages optimization opportunities in inter-operator transforms, data layout, and operator-specific schedules. By building on one general matrix multiply (GEMM) template and a node/edge traversal template, Pigeon achieves up to 7.8x speed-up in inference and 5.6x speed-up in training compared with the state-of-the-art public systems in select models, i.e., RGCN, RGAT, HGT, when running heterogeneous graphs provided by Deep Graph Library (DGL) and Open Graph Benchmark (OGB). Pigeon also triggers fewer out-of-memory (OOM) errors. In addition, we propose linear operator fusion and compact materialization to further accelerate the system by up to 2.2x. ",

    "abstract": "The performance of a machine learning model degrades when it is applied to data from a similar but different domain than the data it has initially been trained on. The goal of domain adaptation (DA) is to mitigate this domain shift problem by searching for an optimal feature transformation to learn a domain-invariant representation. Such a domain shift can appear in handwriting recognition (HWR) applications where the motion pattern of the hand and with that the motion pattern of the pen is different for writing on paper and on tablet. This becomes visible in the sensor data for online handwriting (OnHW) from pens with integrated inertial measurement units. This paper proposes a supervised DA approach to enhance learning for OnHW recognition between tablet and paper data. Our method exploits loss functions such as maximum mean discrepancy and correlation alignment to learn a domain-invariant feature representation (i.e., similar covariances between tablet and paper features). We use a triplet loss that takes negative samples of the auxiliary domain (i.e., paper samples) to increase the amount of samples of the tablet dataset. We conduct an evaluation on novel sequence-based OnHW datasets (i.e., words) and show an improvement on the paper domain with an early fusion strategy by using pairwise learning. ",

In multi-hop UAV networks, the successful transmission of these tasks to the edge is severely challenged due to severe bandwidth constraints. For this reason, we propose a novel A$^2$-UAV framework to optimize the number of correctly executed tasks at the edge. In stark contrast with existing art, we take an application-aware approach and formulate a novel pplication-Aware Task Planning Problem (A$^2$-TPP) that takes into account (i) the relationship between deep neural network (DNN) accuracy and image compression for the classes of interest based on the available dataset, (ii) the target positions, (iii) the current energy/position of the UAVs to optimize routing, data pre-processing and target assignment for each UAV. We demonstrate A$^2$-TPP is NP-Hard and propose a polynomial-time algorithm to solve it efficiently. We extensively evaluate A$^2$-UAV through real-world experiments with a testbed composed by four DJI Mavic Air 2 UAVs. We consider state-of-the-art image classification tasks with four different DNN models (i.e., DenseNet, ResNet152, ResNet50 and MobileNet-V2) and object detection tasks using YoloV4 trained on the ImageNet dataset. Results show that A$^2$-UAV attains on average around 38% more accomplished tasks than the state-of-the-art, with 400% more accomplished tasks when the number of targets increases significantly.

Typically, such a kernel is given as a matrix function of the graph Laplacian. Its direct calculation leads to a high computational burden if the size of the graph is very large. In this work, we investigate five different block Krylov subspace methods to obtain cheaper iterative approximations of these kernels. We will investigate convergence properties of these Krylov subspace methods and study to what extent these methods are able to preserve the symmetry and positive definiteness of the original kernels they are approximating. We will further discuss the computational complexity and the memory requirements of these methods, as well as possible implications for the kernel predictors in machine learning. ",

Moreover, contrary to most earlier studies, the gradient of the risks is not assumed to be bounded (a condition that rarely holds in practice; e.g., quadratic risk). We avoid this condition and still devise a differentially private scheme with high probability.

We test the model with a dataset collected in the Linux Kernel developer community, using structural equation modeling techniques. Our results for this case study show that intrinsic motivations - social or hedonic motives - are positively associated with a sense of virtual community, but living in an authoritative country and being paid to contribute can reduce the sense of virtual community.

    "abstract": "Though deep neural networks have achieved impressive success on various vision tasks, obvious performance degradation still exists when models are tested in out-of-distribution scenarios. In addressing this limitation, we ponder that the feature statistics (mean and standard deviation), which carry the domain characteristics of the training data, can be properly manipulated to improve the generalization ability of deep learning models. Existing methods commonly consider feature statistics as deterministic values measured from the learned features and do not explicitly model the uncertain statistics discrepancy caused by potential domain shifts during testing. In this paper, we improve the network generalization ability by modeling domain shifts with uncertainty (DSU), i.e., characterizing the feature statistics as uncertain distributions during training. Specifically, we hypothesize that the feature statistic, after considering the potential uncertainties, follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. During inference, we propose an instance-wise adaptation strategy that can adaptively deal with the unforeseeable shift and further enhance the generalization ability of the trained model with negligible additional cost. We also conduct theoretical analysis on the aspects of generalization error bound and the implicit regularization effect, showing the efficacy of our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently improves the network generalization ability on multiple vision tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, instance retrieval, and pose estimation. Our methods are simple yet effective and can be readily integrated into networks without additional trainable parameters or loss constraints.

In particular, two different configurations were explored and compared: the virtual character was displayed either on a tablet strapped onto the base of the cobot or on a large TV screen positioned at the back of the workcell. The results imply that participants showed no clear preference based on the constructs, and both configurations fulfill these basic criteria. In terms of the relations between the constructs, there were strong correlations between perception of Social Presence, Unity and Social Role (Collegiality). This gives a valuable insight into the role of these constructs in the perception of cobots as embodied social entities, and towards building cobots that support well-being at the workplace. ",

The framework assigns seeds to nodes and propagates them in a BFS-like fashion, computing the neighbors set until we obtain either the whole vertex set (the diameter) or a given percentage (the effective diameter). At each iteration, we derive compressed Boolean representations of the neighborhood sets discovered so far. The PROPAGATE framework yields two algorithms: PROPAGATE-P, which propagates all the $s$ seeds in parallel, and PROPAGATE-s which propagates the seeds sequentially. For each node, the compressed representation of the PROPAGATE-P algorithm requires $s$ bits while that of PROPAGATE-S only $1$ bit. Both algorithms compute the average distance, the effective diameter, the diameter, and the connectivity rate within a small error with high probability: for any $\\varepsilon>0$ and using $s=\\Theta\\left(\\frac{\\log n}{\\varepsilon^2}\\right)$ sample nodes, the error for the average distance is bounded by $\\xi = \\frac{\\varepsilon \\Delta}{\\alpha}$, the error for the effective diameter and the diameter are bounded by $\\xi = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\alpha}$, and the error for the connectivity rate is bounded by $\\varepsilon$ where $\\Delta$ is the diameter and $\\alpha$ is a measure of connectivity of the graph. The time complexity is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(m\\Delta \\frac{\\log n}{\\varepsilon^2}\\right)$, where $m$ is the number of edges of the graph. The experimental results show that the PROPAGATE framework improves the current state of the art both in accuracy and speed.

Through interviews with 19 app developers and a survey of 309 Android and iOS end-users, we found that both groups shared similar concerns about unnecessary permissions breaking trust, damaging the app's reputation, and potentially allowing access to sensitive data. We also found that developer participants sometimes requested multiple permissions due to confusion about the scope of certain permissions or third-party library requirements. Additionally, most end-user participants believed they were responsible for granting a permission request, and it was their choice to do so, a belief shared by many developer participants.

Materials and Methods: We developed multiple text mining models on different combinations of within-institution and external-institution data to extract social factors from discharge reports of intensive care patients. Subsequently, we assessed the associations between social factors and having a do-not-resuscitate/intubate code. Results: Important differences were found between associations based on manually labeled data compared to text-mined social factors in three out of five cases. Adopting external-institution text mining models using manually labeled within-institution data resulted in models with higher F1-scores, but not in meaningfully different associations. Discussion: While text mining facilitated scaling analyses to larger samples leading to discovering a larger number of associations, the estimates may be unreliable. Confirmation is needed with better text mining models, ideally on a larger manually labeled dataset. Conclusion: The currently used text mining models were not sufficiently accurate to be used reliably in an association study. Model adaptation using within-institution data did not improve the estimates. Further research is needed to set conditions for reliable use of text mining in medical research. ",

    "abstract": "We propose causal recurrent variational autoencoder (CR-VAE), a novel generative model that is able to learn a Granger causal graph from a multivariate time series x and incorporates the underlying causal mechanism into its data generation process. Distinct to the classical recurrent VAEs, our CR-VAE uses a multi-head decoder, in which the $p$-th head is responsible for generating the $p$-th dimension of $\\mathbf{x}$ (i.e., $\\mathbf{x}^p$). By imposing a sparsity-inducing penalty on the weights (of the decoder) and encouraging specific sets of weights to be zero, our CR-VAE learns a sparse adjacency matrix that encodes causal relations between all pairs of variables. Thanks to this causal matrix, our decoder strictly obeys the underlying principles of Granger causality, thereby making the data generating process transparent. We develop a two-stage approach to train the overall objective. Empirically, we evaluate the behavior of our model in synthetic data and two real-world human brain datasets involving, respectively, the electroencephalography (EEG) signals and the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art time series generative models both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, it also discovers a faithful causal graph with similar or improved accuracy over existing Granger causality-based causal inference methods.

    "abstract": "When learning from very small data sets, the resulting models can make many mistakes. For example, consider learning predictors for open source project health. The training data for this task may be very small (e.g. five years of data, collected every month means just 60 rows of training data). Using this data, prior work had unacceptably large errors in their learned predictors. We show that these high errors rates can be tamed by better configuration of the control parameters of the machine learners. For example, we present here a {\\em landscape analytics} method (called SNEAK) that (a)~clusters the data to find the general landscape of the hyperparameters; then (b)~explores a few representatives from each part of that landscape. SNEAK is both faster and and more effective than prior state-of-the-art hyperparameter optimization algorithms (FLASH, HYPEROPT, OPTUNA, and differential evolution). More importantly, the configurations found by SNEAK had far less error that other methods. We conjecture that SNEAK works so well since it finds the most informative regions of the hyperparameters, then jumps to those regions. Other methods (that do not reflect over the landscape) can waste time exploring less informative options. From this, we make the following conclusions. Firstly, for predicting open source project health, we recommend landscape analytics (e.g.SNEAK). Secondly, and more generally, when learning from very small data sets, using hyperparameter optimization (e.g. SNEAK) to select learning control parameters. Due to its speed and implementation simplicity, we suggest SNEAK might also be useful in other ``data-light'' SE domains.

    "abstract": "Estimating how a treatment affects different individuals, known as heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, is an important problem in empirical sciences. In the last few years, there has been a considerable interest in adapting machine learning algorithms to the problem of estimating heterogeneous effects from observational and experimental data. However, these algorithms often make strong assumptions about the observed features in the data and ignore the structure of the underlying causal model, which can lead to biased estimation. At the same time, the underlying causal mechanism is rarely known in real-world datasets, making it hard to take it into consideration. In this work, we provide a survey of state-of-the-art data-driven methods for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation using machine learning, broadly categorizing them as methods that focus on counterfactual prediction and methods that directly estimate the causal effect. We also provide an overview of a third category of methods which rely on structural causal models and learn the model structure from data. Our empirical evaluation under various underlying structural model mechanisms shows the advantages and deficiencies of existing estimators and of the metrics for measuring their performance. ",

Especially when funding is limited, it is imperative to optimise spending without sacrificing positive outcomes, a challenge which has often been approached within several areas of social, life and engineering sciences. These studies often neglect the availability of information, cost restraints, or the underlying complex network structures, which define real-world populations. Here, we have extended these models, including the aforementioned concerns, but also tested the robustness of their findings to stochastic social learning paradigms. Akin to real-world decisions on how best to distribute endowments, we study several incentive schemes, which consider information about the overall population, local neighbourhoods, or the level of influence which a cooperative node has in the network, selectively rewarding cooperative behaviour if certain criteria are met. Following a transition towards a more realistic network setting and stochastic behavioural update rule, we found that carelessly promoting cooperators can often lead to their downfall in socially diverse settings. These emergent cyclic patterns not only damage cooperation, but also decimate the budgets of external investors. Our findings highlight the complexity of designing effective and cogent investment policies in socially diverse populations. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning methods typically depend on the availability of labeled data, which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Active learning addresses such effort by prioritizing which samples are best to annotate in order to maximize the performance of the task model. While frameworks for active learning have been widely explored in the context of classification of natural images, they have been only sparsely used in medical image segmentation. The challenge resides in obtaining an uncertainty measure that reveals the best candidate data for annotation. This paper proposes Test-time Augmentation for Active Learning (TAAL), a novel semi-supervised active learning approach for segmentation that exploits the uncertainty information offered by data transformations. Our method applies cross-augmentation consistency during training and inference to both improve model learning in a semi-supervised fashion and identify the most relevant unlabeled samples to annotate next. In addition, our consistency loss uses a modified version of the JSD to further improve model performance. By relying on data transformations rather than on external modules or simple heuristics typically used in uncertainty-based strategies, TAAL emerges as a simple, yet powerful task-agnostic semi-supervised active learning approach applicable to the medical domain. Our results on a publicly-available dataset of cardiac images show that TAAL outperforms existing baseline methods in both fully-supervised and semi-supervised settings. Our implementation is publicly available on https://github.com/melinphd/TAAL. ",

    "abstract": "Activation functions play critical roles in neural networks, yet current off-the-shelf neural networks pay little attention to the specific choice of activation functions used. Here we show that data-aware customization of activation functions can result in striking reductions in neural network error. We first give a simple linear algebraic explanation of the role of activation functions in neural networks; then, through connection with the Diaconis-Shahshahani Approximation Theorem, we propose a set of criteria for good activation functions. As a case study, we consider regression tasks with a partially exchangeable target function, \\emph{i.e.} $f(u,v,w)=f(v,u,w)$ for $u,v\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and $w\\in \\mathbb{R}^k$, and prove that for such a target function, using an even activation function in at least one of the layers guarantees that the prediction preserves partial exchangeability for best performance. Since even activation functions are seldom used in practice, we designed the ``seagull'' even activation function $\\log(1+x^2)$ according to our criteria. Empirical testing on over two dozen 9-25 dimensional examples with different local smoothness, curvature, and degree of exchangeability revealed that a simple substitution with the ``seagull'' activation function in an already-refined neural network can lead to an order-of-magnitude reduction in error. This improvement was most pronounced when the activation function substitution was applied to the layer in which the exchangeable variables are connected for the first time. While the improvement is greatest for low-dimensional data, experiments on the CIFAR10 image classification dataset showed that use of ``seagull'' can reduce error even for high-dimensional cases. These results collectively highlight the potential of customizing activation functions as a general approach to improve neural network performance. ",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has gained increasing interest in recent years as a distributed on-device learning paradigm. However, multiple challenges remain to be addressed for deploying FL in real-world Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks with hierarchies. Although existing works have proposed various approaches to account data heterogeneity, system heterogeneity, unexpected stragglers and scalibility, none of them provides a systematic solution to address all of the challenges in a hierarchical and unreliable IoT network. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous and hierarchical framework (Async-HFL) for performing FL in a common three-tier IoT network architecture. In response to the largely varied delays, Async-HFL employs asynchronous aggregations at both the gateway and the cloud levels thus avoids long waiting time. To fully unleash the potential of Async-HFL in converging speed under system heterogeneities and stragglers, we design device selection at the gateway level and device-gateway association at the cloud level. Device selection chooses edge devices to trigger local training in real-time while device-gateway association determines the network topology periodically after several cloud epochs, both satisfying bandwidth limitation. We evaluate Async-HFL's convergence speedup using large-scale simulations based on ns-3 and a network topology from NYCMesh. Our results show that Async-HFL converges 1.08-1.31x faster in wall-clock time and saves up to 21.6% total communication cost compared to state-of-the-art asynchronous FL algorithms (with client selection). We further validate Async-HFL on a physical deployment and observe robust convergence under unexpected stragglers. ",

However, given the diversity of SE platforms, SE-specific sentiment detection tools may suffer in performance in cross-platform settings. Recently deep learning (DL)-based SE-specific sentiment detection tools are found to offer superior performance than shallow machine learning (ML) based/rule-based tools. However, it is not known how the DL tools perform in cross-platform settings. In this paper, we study whether SE-specific DL sentiment detectors are more effective than shallow ML-based/rule-based sentiment detectors in cross-platform settings. In three datasets, we study three DL tools (SEntiMoji, BERT4SEntiSE, RNN4SentiSE) and compare those against three baselines: two shallow learning tools (Senti4SD, SentiCR) and one rule-based tool (SentistrengthSE). We find that (1) The deep learning SD tools for SE, BERT4SentiSE outperform other supervised tools in cross-platform settings in most cases, but then the tool is outperformed by the rule-based tool SentistrengthSE in most cases. (2) BERT4SentiSE outperforms SentistrengthSE by large margin in within-platform settings across the three datasets and is only narrowly outperformed by SentiStrengthSE in four out of the six cross-platform settings. This finding offers hope for the feasibility to further improve a pre-trained transformer model like BERT4SentiSE in cross-platform settings. (3) The two best-performing deep learning tools (BERT4SentiSE and SentiMoji) show varying level performance drop across the three datasets. We find that this inconsistency is mainly due to the \"subjectivity in annotation\" and performance improvement for the studied supervised tools in cross-platform settings may require the fixing of the datasets.

    "abstract": "Graph learning, which aims to infer the underlying topology behind high dimension data, has attracted intense attention. In this study, we shed a new light on graph learning by considering a pragmatic scenario where data are privacy sensitive and located in separated clients (devices or organizations). The main difficulty in learning graphs in this scenario is that we cannot process all the data in a central server, because the data are not allowed to leave the local clients due to privacy concerns. The problem becomes more challenging when data of different clients are non-IID, since it is unreasonable to learn a global graph for heterogeneous data. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework in which a personalized graph for each client and a consensus graph are jointly learned in a federated fashion. Specifically, we commute model updates instead of raw data to the central server in the proposed federated algorithm. A provable convergence analysis shows that the algorithm enjoys $\\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ convergence rate. To further enhance privacy, we design a deferentially privacy algorithm to prevent the information of the raw data from being leaked when transferring model updates. A theoretical guidance is provided on how to ensure that the algorithm satisfies differential privacy. We also analyze the impact of differential privacy on the convergence of our algorithm. Finally, extensive experiments on both synthetic and real world data are carried out to validate the proposed models and algorithms. Experimental results illustrate that our framework is able to learn graphs effectively in the target scenario. ",

    "abstract": "Temperature field prediction is of great importance in the thermal design of systems engineering, and building the surrogate model is an effective way for the task. Generally, large amounts of labeled data are required to guarantee a good prediction performance of the surrogate model, especially the deep learning model, which have more parameters and better representational ability. However, labeled data, especially high-fidelity labeled data, are usually expensive to obtain and sometimes even impossible. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a pithy deep multi-fidelity model (DMFM) for temperature field prediction, which takes advantage of low-fidelity data to boost the performance with less high-fidelity data. First, a pre-train and fine-tune paradigm are developed in DMFM to train the low-fidelity and high-fidelity data, which significantly reduces the complexity of the deep surrogate model. Then, a self-supervised learning method for training the physics-driven deep multi-fidelity model (PD-DMFM) is proposed, which fully utilizes the physics characteristics of the engineering systems and reduces the dependence on large amounts of labeled low-fidelity data in the training process. Two diverse temperature field prediction problems are constructed to validate the effectiveness of DMFM and PD-DMFM, and the result shows that the proposed method can greatly reduce the dependence of the model on high-fidelity data.

    "abstract": "Existing salient object detection methods often adopt deeper and wider networks for better performance, resulting in heavy computational burden and slow inference speed. This inspires us to rethink saliency detection to achieve a favorable balance between efficiency and accuracy. To this end, we design a lightweight framework while maintaining satisfying competitive accuracy. Specifically, we propose a novel trilateral decoder framework by decoupling the U-shape structure into three complementary branches, which are devised to confront the dilution of semantic context, loss of spatial structure and absence of boundary detail, respectively. Along with the fusion of three branches, the coarse segmentation results are gradually refined in structure details and boundary quality. Without adding additional learnable parameters, we further propose Scale-Adaptive Pooling Module to obtain multi-scale receptive filed. In particular, on the premise of inheriting this framework, we rethink the relationship among accuracy, parameters and speed via network depth-width tradeoff. With these insightful considerations, we comprehensively design shallower and narrower models to explore the maximum potential of lightweight SOD. Our models are purposed for different application environments: 1) a tiny version CTD-S (1.7M, 125FPS) for resource constrained devices, 2) a fast version CTD-M (12.6M, 158FPS) for speed-demanding scenarios, 3) a standard version CTD-L (26.5M, 84FPS) for high-performance platforms.

Internet service providers (ISPs) are best poised to play key roles in mitigating risks by automatically inferring active IoT devices per household and notifying users of vulnerable ones. Developing a scalable inference method that can perform robustly across thousands of home networks is a non-trivial task. This paper focuses on the challenges of developing and applying data-driven inference models when labeled data of device behaviors is limited and the distribution of data changes (concept drift) across time and space domains. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We collect and analyze network traffic of 24 types of consumer IoT devices from 12 real homes over six weeks to highlight the challenge of temporal and spatial concept drifts in network behavior of IoT devices; (2) We analyze the performance of two inference strategies, namely \"global inference\" (a model trained on a combined set of all labeled data from training homes) and \"contextualized inference\" (several models each trained on the labeled data from a training home) in the presence of concept drifts; and (3) To manage concept drifts, we develop a method that dynamically applies the ``closest'' model (from a set) to network traffic of unseen homes during the testing phase, yielding better performance in 20% of scenarios.

    "abstract": "With modern computational advancements and statistical analysis methods, machine learning algorithms have become a vital part of engineering modeling. Neural Operator Networks (ONets) is an emerging machine learning algorithm as a \"faster surrogate\" for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their ability to approximate mathematical operators versus the direct approximation of Neural Networks (NN). ONets use the Universal Approximation Theorem to map finite-dimensional inputs to infinite-dimensional space using the branch-trunk architecture, which encodes domain and feature information separately before using a dot product to combine the information. ONets are expected to occupy a vital niche for surrogate modeling in physical systems and Digital Twin (DT) development. Three test cases are evaluated using ONets for operator approximation, including a 1-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODE), general diffusion system, and convection-diffusion (Burger) system. Solutions for ODE and diffusion systems yield accurate and reliable results (R2>0.95), while solutions for Burger systems need further refinement in the ONet algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation plays a critical role in various computer vision and robotics applications such as localization, mapping, and 3D object detection. Recently, learning-based algorithms achieve huge success in depth estimation by training models with a large amount of data in a supervised manner. However, it is challenging to acquire dense ground truth depth labels for supervised training, and the unsupervised depth estimation using monocular sequences emerges as a promising alternative. Unfortunately, most studies on unsupervised depth estimation explore loss functions or occlusion masks, and there is little change in model architecture in that ConvNet-based encoder-decoder structure becomes a de-facto standard for depth estimation. In this paper, we employ a convolution-free Swin Transformer as an image feature extractor so that the network can capture both local geometric features and global semantic features for depth estimation. Also, we propose a Densely Cascaded Multi-scale Network (DCMNet) that connects every feature map directly with another from different scales via a top-down cascade pathway. This densely cascaded connectivity reinforces the interconnection between decoding layers and produces high-quality multi-scale depth outputs. The experiments on two different datasets, KITTI and Make3D, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "Efficient detectors for edge devices are often optimized for metrics like parameters or speed counts, which remain weak correlation with the energy of detectors. However, among vision applications of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), some, such as always-on surveillance cameras, are critical for energy constraints. This paper aims to serve as a baseline by designing detectors to reach tradeoffs between energy and performance from two perspectives: 1) We extensively analyze various CNNs to identify low-energy architectures, including the selection of activation functions, convolutions operators, and feature fusion structures on necks. These underappreciated details in past works seriously affect the energy consumption of detectors; 2) To break through the dilemmatic energy-performance problem, we propose a balanced detector driven by energy using discovered low-energy components named \\textit{FemtoDet}. In addition to the novel construction, we further improve FemtoDet by considering convolutions and training strategy optimizations. Specifically, we develop a new instance boundary enhancement (IBE) module for convolution optimization to overcome the contradiction between the limited capacity of CNNs and detection tasks in diverse spatial representations, and propose a recursive warm-restart (RecWR) for optimizing training strategy to escape the sub-optimization of light-weight detectors, considering the data shift produced in popular augmentations. As a result, FemtoDet with only 68.77k parameters achieves a competitive score of 46.3 AP50 on PASCAL VOC and power of 7.83W on RTX 3090. Extensive experiments on COCO and TJU-DHD datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves competitive results in diverse scenes. ",

Previous research has shown that information about intermediate values of these inputs can be extracted from the activations of the models, but it is unclear where that information is encoded and whether that information is indeed used during inference. We introduce a method for analyzing how a Transformer model processes these inputs by focusing on simple arithmetic problems and their intermediate values. To trace where information about intermediate values is encoded, we measure the correlation between intermediate values and the activations of the model using principal component analysis (PCA). Then, we perform a causal intervention by manipulating model weights. This intervention shows that the weights identified via tracing are not merely correlated with intermediate values, but causally related to model predictions. Our findings show that the model has a locality to certain intermediate values, and this is useful for enhancing the interpretability of the models. ",

Despite their successes, existing detectors have at least two of the three weaknesses: (a) high computational cost which limits them to small-scale networks only; (b) existing treatment of subgraphs produces suboptimal detection accuracy; and (c) unable to provide an explanation as to why a node is anomalous, once it is identified. We identify that the root cause of these weaknesses is a lack of a proper treatment for subgraphs. A treatment called Subgraph Centralization for graph anomaly detection is proposed to address all the above weaknesses. Its importance is shown in two ways. First, we present a simple yet effective new framework called Graph-Centric Anomaly Detection (GCAD). The key advantages of GCAD over existing detectors including deep-learning detectors are: (i) better anomaly detection accuracy; (ii) linear time complexity with respect to the number of nodes; and (iii) it is a generic framework that admits an existing point anomaly detector to be used to detect node anomalies in a network. Second, we show that Subgraph Centralization can be incorporated into two existing detectors to overcome the above-mentioned weaknesses. ",

Though EVs are mostly charged at the residence, public charging stations are also required for the ease-of-use. The public electric vehicle charging infrastructures (EVCIs) must be equipped with a good number of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) with fast charging capability to accommodate the EV traffic demand, or else it would lead to congestion at the charging stations. The location of these fast-charging infrastructures significantly impacts the distribution system (DS). We propose the optimal placement of fast-charging EVCIs at different locations in the distribution system so that the power loss and voltage deviations are kept at a minimum using multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). Time-series analysis of the distribution and EV load variations are performed using MATLAB and OpenDSS. We further analyze the cost benefits of the EVCIs for a real-time pricing condition and use an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to predict the dynamic price. This allows the charging station operator to make promotional offers for maximizing utilization and increasing profits. Using the proposed methods, the results obtained validate the optimal location of EVCIs, cost benefits, and dynamic price predictions. ",

As a step toward developing such networks, we hand-code and learn models for Breadth-First Search (BFS), i.e. shortest path finding, using the unified architectural framework of Neural Cellular Automata, which are iterative neural networks with equal-size inputs and outputs. Similarly, we present a neural implementation of Depth-First Search (DFS), and outline how it can be combined with neural BFS to produce an NCA for computing diameter of a graph. We experiment with architectural modifications inspired by these hand-coded NCAs, training networks from scratch to solve the diameter problem on grid mazes while exhibiting strong generalization ability. Finally, we introduce a scheme in which data points are mutated adversarially during training. We find that adversarially evolving mazes leads to increased generalization on out-of-distribution examples, while at the same time generating data-sets with significantly more complex solutions for reasoning tasks.

Furthermore, the existing approaches are not able to incrementally build up their knowledge base, which is very important when robots have to deal with dynamic contexts. To this end, we propose an architecture to gather data from users and environments in long-runs of continual learning. We adopt Knowledge Graph Embedding techniques to generalize the acquired information with the goal of incrementally extending the robot's inner representation of the environment.

However, these models face a fundamental challenge that the syntactic distribution of training data is partially observable in comparison to the real world. In this paper, we propose a syntactically robust training framework that enables models to be trained on a syntactic-abundant distribution based on diverse paraphrase generation. To tackle the intrinsic problem of knowledge deformation of paraphrasing, two algorithms based on semantic similarity matching and syntactic tree walking are used to restore the expressionally transformed knowledge. The training framework can be generally applied to other syntactic partial observable domains. Based on the proposed framework, we build a new evaluation set called CaRB-AutoPara, a syntactically diverse dataset consistent with the real-world setting for validating the robustness of the models. Experiments including a thorough analysis show that the performance of the model degrades with the increase of the difference in syntactic distribution, while our framework gives a robust boundary.

This cannot be done in standard causal models, because we can intervene simultaneously on all three variables. The goal of this paper is to extend standard causal models to allow for constraints on settings of variables.

We use patches of reduced spatial dimension and a complete spectral depth extracted from the remote sensing images. Additionally, we investigate three training schemes for our network: Iterative, Joint, and Cascade. Experiments suggest that the Joint scheme is the best-performing scheme; however, its application requires an expensive search for the best weight combination of the loss constituents. The Iterative scheme enables the sharing of features between the two parts of the network at the early stages of training. It performs better on complex data with multi-labels. Further experiments showed that methods designed with different architectures performed well when trained on patches extracted and labeled according to our sampling method. ",

From the estimation results, it is revealed that there is a strong linear relationship between the applied force or torque and the estimated disturbances. The proposed prediction algorithm has two phases: the identification & the prediction. During the identification phase, the linear relationship is identified from the observer output using a recursive least-square algorithm. In the prediction phase, the identified linear relationship is used with a force plan, which would be provided by a mission planner, to predict the position and the orientation of an object.

The globality of lane representation is the ability to complete invisible parts of lanes with visible parts. The locality of lane representation is the ability to modify lanes locally which can simplify parameter optimization. Specifically, we first propose to exploit the b-spline curve to fit lane lines since it meets the locality and globality. Second, we design a simple yet efficient network BSNet to ensure the acquisition of global and local features. Third, we propose a new curve distance to make the lane detection optimization objective more reasonable and alleviate ill-conditioned problems.

This versatility benefits large-scale space-frame structures, as the individual design of each structural node can be tailored to meet specific mechanical and other functional requirements. To this end, however, the design and analysis of such space-frames with distinct structural nodes needs to be highly automated. A critical aspect in this context is automated integration of the local 3D features into the 1D large-scale models. In the present work, a two-scale modeling approach is developed to improve the design and linear-elastic analysis of space frames with complex additively manufactured nodes. The mechanical characteristics of the 3D nodes are numerically reduced through an automated dimensional reduction process based on the Finite Cell Method (FCM) and substructuring. The reduced stiffness quantities are assembled in the large-scale 1D model which, in turn, enables efficient structural analysis. The response of the 1D model is passed on to the local model, enabling fully resolved 3D linear-elastic analysis. The proposed approach is numerically verified on a simplified beam example. Furthermore, the workflow is demonstrated on a tree canopy structure with additively manufactured nodes with bolted connections. The form of the large-scale structure is found based on the Combinatorial Equilibrium Modeling framework, and the different designs of the local structural nodes are based on generative exploration of the design space. It is demonstrated that the proposed methodology effectively automates the design and analysis of space-frame structures with complex, distinct structural nodes. ",

    "abstract": "The major aim of this paper is to explain the data poisoning attacks using label-flipping during the training stage of the electroencephalogram (EEG) signal-based human emotion evaluation systems deploying Machine Learning models from the attackers' perspective. Human emotion evaluation using EEG signals has consistently attracted a lot of research attention. The identification of human emotional states based on EEG signals is effective to detect potential internal threats caused by insider individuals. Nevertheless, EEG signal-based human emotion evaluation systems have shown several vulnerabilities to data poison attacks. The findings of the experiments demonstrate that the suggested data poison assaults are model-independently successful, although various models exhibit varying levels of resilience to the attacks. In addition, the data poison attacks on the EEG signal-based human emotion evaluation systems are explained with several Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, including Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) values, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), and Generated Decision Trees. And the codes of this paper are publicly available on GitHub. ",

    "abstract": "Social reasoning necessitates the capacity of theory of mind (ToM), the ability to contextualise and attribute mental states to others without having access to their internal cognitive structure. Recent machine learning approaches to ToM have demonstrated that we can train the observer to read the past and present behaviours of other agents and infer their beliefs (including false beliefs about things that no longer exist), goals, intentions and future actions. The challenges arise when the behavioural space is complex, demanding skilful space navigation for rapidly changing contexts for an extended period. We tackle the challenges by equipping the observer with novel neural memory mechanisms to encode, and hierarchical attention to selectively retrieve information about others. The memories allow rapid, selective querying of distal related past behaviours of others to deliberatively reason about their current mental state, beliefs and future behaviours. This results in ToMMY, a theory of mind model that learns to reason while making little assumptions about the underlying mental processes. We also construct a new suite of experiments to demonstrate that memories facilitate the learning process and achieve better theory of mind performance, especially for high-demand false-belief tasks that require inferring through multiple steps of changes.

Existing object detection and pose estimation methods mostly adopt the same-dimensional data for training. For example, 2D object detection usually requires a large amount of 2D annotation data with high cost. Using high-dimensional information to supervise lower-dimensional tasks is a feasible way to reduce datasets size. In this work, the DR-WLC, a dimensionality reduction cognitive model, which can perform both object detection and pose estimation tasks at the same time is proposed. The model only requires 3D model of objects and unlabeled environment images (with or without objects) to finish the training. In addition, a bounding boxes generation strategy is also proposed to build the relationship between 3D model and 2D object detection task. Experiments show that our method can qualify the work without any manual annotations and it is easy to deploy for practical applications. Source code is at https://github.com/IN2-ViAUn/DR-WLC. ",

Such techniques require large amounts of training data, resulting in computationally expensive algorithms. We propose Few Shot anomaly detection (FewSOME), a deep One-Class Anomaly Detection algorithm with the ability to accurately detect anomalies having trained on 'few' examples of the normal class and no examples of the anomalous class. We describe FewSOME to be of low complexity given its low data requirement and short training time. FewSOME is aided by pretrained weights with an architecture based on Siamese Networks. By means of an ablation study, we demonstrate how our proposed loss, 'Stop Loss', improves the robustness of FewSOME. Our experiments demonstrate that FewSOME performs at state-of-the-art level on benchmark datasets MNIST, CIFAR-10, F-MNIST and MVTec AD while training on only 30 normal samples, a minute fraction of the data that existing methods are trained on. Most notably, we found that FewSOME outperforms even highly complex models in the setting where only few examples of the normal class exist. Moreover, our extensive experiments show FewSOME to be robust to contaminated datasets. We also report F1 score and Balanced Accuracy in addition to AUC as a benchmark for future techniques to be compared against. ",

Most of existing XIR approaches focus exclusively on the retrieval model with little consideration on using existing knowledge graphs for providing an explanation. In this paper, we propose a general architecture to incorporate knowledge graphs for XIR in various steps of the retrieval process. Furthermore, we create two instances of the architecture for different types of explanation.

Hence, smartphones have become valuable for HAR as they allow large, and diversified data collection. Although previous work in HAR managed to detect simple activities (i.e., sitting, walking, running) with good accuracy using inertial sensors (i.e., accelerometer), the recognition of complex daily activities remains an open problem, specially in remote work/study settings when people are more sedentary. Moreover, understanding the everyday activities of a person can support the creation of applications that aim to support their well-being. This paper investigates the recognition of complex activities exclusively using smartphone accelerometer data. We used a large smartphone sensing dataset collected from over 600 users in five countries during the pandemic and showed that deep learning-based, binary classification of eight complex activities (sleeping, eating, watching videos, online communication, attending a lecture, sports, shopping, studying) can be achieved with AUROC scores up to 0.76 with partially personalized models.

The output is an assignment that maps each client to one of its adjacent servers, and the load of a server is then the sum of the weights of the clients assigned to it. The goal is to find an assignment that is well-balanced, typically captured by (approximately) minimizing either the $\\ell_\\infty$- or $\\ell_2$-norm of the server loads. Generalizing both of these objectives, the all-norm load balancing problem asks for an assignment that approximately minimizes all $\\ell_p$-norm objectives for $p \\ge 1$, including $p = \\infty$, simultaneously. Our main result is a deterministic $O(\\log{n})$-pass $O(1)$-approximation semi-streaming algorithm for the all-norm load balancing problem. Prior to our work, only an $O(\\log{n})$-pass $O(\\log{n})$-approximation algorithm for the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm objective was known in the semi-streaming setting.

It is also crucial for research on the influence of bots in elections, the spread of misinformation, and financial market manipulation. Platforms deploy infrastructure to flag or remove automated accounts, but their tools and data are not publicly available. Thus, the public must rely on third-party bot detection. These tools employ machine learning and often achieve near perfect performance for classification on existing datasets, suggesting bot detection is accurate, reliable and fit for use in downstream applications. We provide evidence that this is not the case and show that high performance is attributable to limitations in dataset collection and labeling rather than sophistication of the tools. Specifically, we show that simple decision rules -- shallow decision trees trained on a small number of features -- achieve near-state-of-the-art performance on most available datasets and that bot detection datasets, even when combined together, do not generalize well to out-of-sample datasets. Our findings reveal that predictions are highly dependent on each dataset's collection and labeling procedures rather than fundamental differences between bots and humans. These results have important implications for both transparency in sampling and labeling procedures and potential biases in research using existing bot detection tools for pre-processing. ",

    "abstract": "Objective: To develop and validate a deep learning model for the identification of out-of-body images in endoscopic videos. Background: Surgical video analysis facilitates education and research. However, video recordings of endoscopic surgeries can contain privacy-sensitive information, especially if out-of-body scenes are recorded. Therefore, identification of out-of-body scenes in endoscopic videos is of major importance to preserve the privacy of patients and operating room staff. Methods: A deep learning model was trained and evaluated on an internal dataset of 12 different types of laparoscopic and robotic surgeries. External validation was performed on two independent multicentric test datasets of laparoscopic gastric bypass and cholecystectomy surgeries. All images extracted from the video datasets were annotated as inside or out-of-body. Model performance was evaluated compared to human ground truth annotations measuring the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC). Results: The internal dataset consisting of 356,267 images from 48 videos and the two multicentric test datasets consisting of 54,385 and 58,349 images from 10 and 20 videos, respectively, were annotated. Compared to ground truth annotations, the model identified out-of-body images with 99.97% ROC AUC on the internal test dataset. Mean $\\pm$ standard deviation ROC AUC on the multicentric gastric bypass dataset was 99.94$\\pm$0.07% and 99.71$\\pm$0.40% on the multicentric cholecystectomy dataset, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed deep learning model can reliably identify out-of-body images in endoscopic videos. The trained model is publicly shared. This facilitates privacy preservation in surgical video analysis. ",

    "abstract": "Algorithm fairness in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) is essential for a better society. As the foundational axiom of social mechanisms, fairness consists of multiple facets. Although the machine learning (ML) community has focused on intersectionality as a matter of statistical parity, especially in discrimination issues, an emerging body of literature addresses another facet -- monotonicity. Based on domain expertise, monotonicity plays a vital role in numerous fairness-related areas, where violations could misguide human decisions and lead to disastrous consequences. In this paper, we first systematically evaluate the significance of applying monotonic neural additive models (MNAMs), which use a fairness-aware ML algorithm to enforce both individual and pairwise monotonicity principles, for the fairness of AI ethics and society. We have found, through a hybrid method of theoretical reasoning, simulation, and extensive empirical analysis, that considering monotonicity axioms is essential in all areas of fairness, including criminology, education, health care, and finance. Our research contributes to the interdisciplinary research at the interface of AI ethics, explainable AI (XAI), and human-computer interactions (HCIs). By evidencing the catastrophic consequences if monotonicity is not met, we address the significance of monotonicity requirements in AI applications. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MNAMs are an effective fairness-aware ML approach by imposing monotonicity restrictions integrating human intelligence. ",

In this paper, we introduce the #DNN-Verification problem, which involves counting the number of input configurations of a DNN that result in a violation of a particular safety property. We analyze the complexity of this problem and propose a novel approach that returns the exact count of violations. Due to the #P-completeness of the problem, we also propose a randomized, approximate method that provides a provable probabilistic bound of the correct count while significantly reducing computational requirements. We present experimental results on a set of safety-critical benchmarks that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approximate method and evaluate the tightness of the bound. ",

    "abstract": "This paper assesses the equity impacts of for-hire autonomous vehicles (AVs) and investigates regulatory policies that promote the spatial and social equity in future autonomous mobility ecosystems. To this end, we consider a multimodal transportation network, where a ride-hailing platform operates a fleet of AVs to offer mobility-on-demand services in competition with a public transit agency that offers transit services on a transportation network. A game-theoretic model is developed to characterize the intimate interactions between the ride-hailing platform, the transit agency, and multiclass passengers with distinct income levels. An algorithm is proposed to compute the Nash equilibrium of the game and conduct an ex-post evaluation of the performance of the obtained solution. Based on the proposed framework, we evaluate the spatial and social equity in transport accessibility using Theil index, and find that although the proliferation of for-hire AVs in the ride-hailing network improves overall accessibility, the benefits are not fairly distributed among distinct locations or population groups, implying that the deployment of AVs will enlarge the existing spatial and social inequity gaps in the transportation network if no regulatory intervention is in place. To address this concern, we investigate two regulatory policies that can improve transport equity: (a) a minimum service-level requirement on ride-hailing service, which improves the spatial equity in the transport network; (b) a subsidy on ride-hailing trips that serve as first/last-mile connection to public transit, which promotes the use of public transit and improves the social equity of the transport network. We show that the minimum service-level requirement entails a trade-off: as a higher minimum service level is imposed, the spatial inequity reduces, but the social inequity will be exacerbated.

The human perception and analysis of sound comprise of two important cognitive parts: early auditory analysis and cortex-based processing. The early auditory analysis considers spectrogram-based representation whereas cortex-based analysis includes extraction of temporal modulations from the spectrogram. This temporal modulation representation of spectrogram is called modulation spectral feature (MSF). As the constant-Q transform (CQT) provides higher resolution at emotion salient low-frequency regions of speech, we find that CQT-based spectrogram, together with its temporal modulations, provides a representation enriched with emotion-specific information. We argue that CQT-MSF when used with a 2-dimensional convolutional network can provide a time-shift invariant and deformation insensitive representation for SER. Our results show that CQT-MSF outperforms standard mel-scale based spectrogram and its modulation features on two popular SER databases, Berlin EmoDB and RAVDESS. We also show that our proposed feature outperforms the shift and deformation invariant scattering transform coefficients, hence, showing the importance of joint hand-crafted and self-learned feature extraction instead of reliance on complete hand-crafted features. Finally, we perform Grad-CAM analysis to visually inspect the contribution of constant-Q modulation features over SER. ",

To enhance the noise adaptation capability of current methods, we first resort to the weighted HSI denoising model since its weight is capable of characterizing the noise in different positions of the image. However, the weight in these weighted models is always determined by an empirical updating formula, which does not fully utilize the noise information contained in noisy images and thus limits their performance improvement. In this work, we propose an automatic weighting scheme to alleviate this issue. Specifically, the weight in the weighted model is predicted by a hyper-weight network (i.e., HWnet), which can be learned in a bi-level optimization framework based on the data-driven methodology. The learned HWnet can be explicitly plugged into other weighted denoising models, and help adjust weights for different noisy HSIs and different weighted models. Extensive experiments verify that the proposed HWnet can help improve the generalization ability of a weighted model to adapt to more complex noise, and can also strengthen the weighted model by transferring the knowledge from another weighted model. Additionally, to explain the experimental results, we also theoretically prove the training error and generalization error upper bound of the proposed HWnet, which should be the first generalization error analysis in the low-level vision field as far as we know.

At present, machine learning-based methodologies are gaining popularity as a means of predicting binding affinity due to their efficiency and accuracy, as well as the increasing availability of structural and binding affinity data for protein-ligand complexes. In biomolecular studies, graph theory has been widely applied since graphs can be used to model molecules or molecular complexes in a natural manner. In the present work, we upgrade the graph-based learners for the study of protein-ligand interactions by integrating extensive atom types such as SYBYL and extended connectivity interactive features (ECIF) into multiscale weighted colored graphs (MWCG).

    "abstract": "According to the Lancet report on the global burden of disease published in October 2020, air pollution is among the five highest risk factors for global health, reducing life expectancy on average by 20 months. This paper describes a data-driven method for establishing causal relationships within and between two multivariate time series data streams derived from wearable sensors: personal exposure to airborne particulate matter of aerodynamic sizes less than 2.5um (PM2.5) gathered from the Airspeck monitor worn on the person and continuous respiratory rate (breaths per minute) measured by the Respeck monitor worn as a plaster on the chest. Results are presented for a cohort of 113 asthmatic adolescents using the PCMCI+ algorithm to learn the short-term causal relationships between lags of \\pm exposure and respiratory rate. We consider causal effects up to a maximum delay of 8 hours, using data at both a 1 minute and 15 minute resolution in different experiments. For the first time a personalised exposure-response relationship between PM2.5 exposure and respiratory rate has been demonstrated to exist for short-term effects in asthmatic adolescents during their everyday lives. Our results lead to recommendations for work on specific open problems in causal discovery, to increase the feasibility of this approach for similar epidemiology studies in the future. ",

    "abstract": "One of the main challenges in drug discovery is to find molecules that bind specifically and strongly to their target protein while having minimal binding to other proteins. By predicting binding affinity, it is possible to identify the most promising candidates from a large pool of potential compounds, reducing the number of compounds that need to be tested experimentally. Recently, deep learning methods have shown superior performance than traditional computational methods for making accurate predictions on large datasets. However, the complexity and time-consuming nature of these methods have limited their usage and development. Quantum machine learning is an emerging technology that has the potential to improve many classical machine learning algorithms. In this work we present a hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural network, which is able to reduce by 20\\% the complexity of the classical network while maintaining optimal performance in the predictions. Additionally, it results in a significant time savings of up to 40\\% in the training process, which means a meaningful speed up of the drug discovery process. ",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Machine learning methods can be used to support scientific discovery in healthcare-related research fields. However, these methods can only be reliably used if they can be trained on high-quality and curated datasets. Currently, no such dataset for the exploration of Plasmodium falciparum protein antigen candidates exists. The parasite Plasmodium falciparum causes the infectious disease malaria. Thus, identifying potential antigens is of utmost importance for the development of antimalarial drugs and vaccines. Since exploring antigen candidates experimentally is an expensive and time-consuming process, applying machine learning methods to support this process has the potential to accelerate the development of drugs and vaccines which are needed for fighting and controlling malaria. Results: We developed PlasmoFAB, a curated benchmark that can be used to train machine learning methods for the exploration of Plasmodium falciparum protein antigen candidates. We combined an extensive literature search with domain expertise to create high-quality labels for Plasmodium falciparum specific proteins that distinguish between antigen candidates and intracellular proteins. Additionally, we used our benchmark to compare different well-known prediction models and available protein localization prediction services on the task of identifying protein antigen candidates. We show that available general-purpose services are unable to provide sufficient performance on identifying protein antigen candidates and are outperformed by models that were trained on specialized data.

In a practical application, recent pilot observations at the base station (BS) can be utilized for training. This is in sharp contrast to state-of-theart machine learning (ML) techniques where a reference dataset consisting of perfect channel state information (CSI) labels is a prerequisite, which is generally unaffordable. In particular, we propose an adapted training procedure for fitting the GMM which is a generative model that represents the distribution of all potential channels associated with a specific BS cell. To this end, the necessary modifications of the underlying expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm are derived. Numerical results show that the proposed estimator performs close to the case where perfect CSI is available for the training and exhibits a higher robustness against imperfections in the training data as compared to state-of-the-art ML techniques.

    "abstract": "Neural network-based survival methods can model data-driven covariate interactions. While these methods have led to better predictive performance than regression-based approaches, they cannot model both time-varying interactions and complex baseline hazards. To address this, we propose Case-Base Neural Networks (CBNN) as a new approach that combines the case-base sampling framework with flexible architectures. Our method naturally accounts for censoring and does not require method specific hyperparameters. Using a novel sampling scheme and data augmentation, we incorporate time directly into a feed-forward neural network. CBNN predicts the probability of an event occurring at a given moment and estimates the hazard function. We compare the performance of CBNN to survival methods based on regression and neural networks in two simulations and two real data applications. We report two time-dependent metrics for each model. In the simulations and real data applications, CBNN provides a more consistent predictive performance across time and outperforms the competing neural network approaches. For a simple simulation with an exponential hazard model, CBNN outperforms the other neural network methods. For a complex simulation, which highlights the ability of CBNN to model both a complex baseline hazard and time-varying interactions, CBNN outperforms all competitors. The first real data application shows CBNN outperforming all neural network competitors, while a second real data application shows competitive performance. We highlight the benefit of combining case-base sampling with deep learning to provide a simple and flexible modeling framework for data-driven, time-varying interaction modeling of survival outcomes.

Specifically, with the increase in cases, the diagnosis and identification need to be faster and more accurate for many patients; in endoscopic images, the segmentation task has been vital to helping the doctor identify the position of the polyps or the ache in the system correctly. As a result, many efforts have been made to apply deep learning to automate polyp segmentation, mostly to ameliorate the U-shape structure. However, the simple skip connection scheme in UNet leads to deficient context information and the semantic gap between feature maps from the encoder and decoder. To deal with this problem, we propose a novel framework composed of ConvNeXt backbone and Multi Kernel Positional Embedding block. Thanks to the suggested module, our method can attain better accuracy and generalization in the polyps segmentation task. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves the Dice coefficient of 0.8818 and the IOU score of 0.8163 on the Kvasir-SEG dataset.

Echo State Networks (ESN) are a class of recurrent neural networks that are computationally effective, since they avoid backpropagation and require only cross-validation. Furthermore, they have been proven to be universal approximants of dynamical systems. In this paper, we present the performance reached by ESN based on an ensemble approach for the prediction of the phase-space stability region and compare it with analytical scaling laws based on the stability-time estimate of the Nekhoroshev theorem for Hamiltonian systems. We observe that the proposed ESN approach is capable of effectively predicting the time evolution of the extent of the dynamic aperture, improving the predictions by analytical scaling laws, thus providing an efficient surrogate model.

Tools to assist in making a diagnosis are required to manage the increasing workload. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) and deep-learning based tools may be used in daily pathology practice. However, it is challenging to develop fast and reliable algorithms that can be trusted by practitioners, whatever the medical center. We describe a patch-based algorithm that incorporates a convolutional neural network to detect and locate invasive carcinoma on breast whole-slide images. The network was trained on a dataset extracted from a reference acquisition center. We then performed a calibration step based on transfer learning to maintain the performance when translating on a new target acquisition center by using a limited amount of additional training data. Performance was evaluated using classical binary measures (accuracy, recall, precision) for both centers (referred to as test reference dataset and test target dataset) and at two levels: patch and slide level. At patch level, accuracy, recall, and precision of the model on the reference and target test sets were 92.1\\% and 96.3\\%, 95\\% and 87.8\\%, and 73.9\\% and 70.6\\%, respectively.

The high performance of the algorithm at both centers shows that the calibration process is efficient.

However, they are mainly used on fixed graphs although many networks grow in practice, with nodes continually attaching to the topology. Re-training the filter every time a new node attaches is computationally demanding; hence an online learning solution that adapts to the evolving graph is needed. We propose an online update of the filter, based on the principles of online machine learning. To update the filter, we perform online gradient descent, which has a provable regret bound with respect to the filter computed offline. We show the performance of our method for signal interpolation at the incoming nodes. Numerical results on synthetic and graph-based recommender systems show that the proposed approach compares well to the offline baseline filter while outperforming competitive approaches.

However, both low-quality fundus images and style inconsistency potentially increase uncertainty in the diagnosis of fundus disease and even lead to misdiagnosis by ophthalmologists. Most of the existing image enhancement methods mainly focus on improving the image quality by leveraging the guidance of high-quality images, which is difficult to be collected in medical applications. In this paper, we tackle image quality enhancement in a fully unsupervised setting, i.e., neither paired images nor high-quality images. To this end, we explore the potential of the self-supervised task for improving the quality of fundus images without the requirement of high-quality reference images. Specifically, we construct multiple patch-wise domains via an auxiliary pre-trained quality assessment network and a style clustering. To achieve robust low-quality image enhancement and address style inconsistency, we formulate two self-supervised domain adaptation tasks to disentangle the features of image content, low-quality factor and style information by exploring intrinsic supervision signals within the low-quality images. Extensive experiments are conducted on EyeQ and Messidor datasets, and results show that our DASQE method achieves new state-of-the-art performance when only low-quality images are available. ",
