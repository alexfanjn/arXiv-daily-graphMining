    "abstract": "Human long duration exploration missions (LDEMs) raise a number of technological challenges. This paper addresses the question of the crew autonomy: as the distances increase, the communication delays and constraints tend to prevent the astronauts from being monitored and supported by a real time ground control. Eventually, future planetary missions will necessarily require a form of astronaut self-scheduling. We study the usage of a computer decision-support tool by a crew of analog astronauts, during a Mars simulation mission conducted at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS, Mars Society) in Utah. The proposed tool, called Romie, belongs to the new category of Robust Advanced Modelling and Scheduling (RAMS) systems. It allows the crew members (i) to visually model their scientific objectives and constraints, (ii) to compute near-optimal operational schedules while taking uncertainty into account, (iii) to monitor the execution of past and current activities, and (iv) to modify scientific objectives/constraints w.r.t. unforeseen events and opportunistic science. In this study, we empirically measure how the astronauts, who are novice planners, perform at using such a tool when self-scheduling under the realistic assumptions of a simulated Martian planetary habitat.

    "title": "Causal conditional hidden Markov model for multimodal traffic prediction",
    "abstract": "Multimodal traffic flow can reflect the health of the transportation system, and its prediction is crucial to urban traffic management. Recent works overemphasize spatio-temporal correlations of traffic flow, ignoring the physical concepts that lead to the generation of observations and their causal relationship. Spatio-temporal correlations are considered unstable under the influence of different conditions, and spurious correlations may exist in observations. In this paper, we analyze the physical concepts affecting the generation of multimode traffic flow from the perspective of the observation generation principle and propose a Causal Conditional Hidden Markov Model (CCHMM) to predict multimodal traffic flow. In the latent variables inference stage, a posterior network disentangles the causal representations of the concepts of interest from conditional information and observations, and a causal propagation module mines their causal relationship. In the data generation stage, a prior network samples the causal latent variables from the prior distribution and feeds them into the generator to generate multimodal traffic flow. We use a mutually supervised training method for the prior and posterior to enhance the identifiability of the model. Experiments on real-world datasets show that CCHMM can effectively disentangle causal representations of concepts of interest and identify causality, and accurately predict multimodal traffic flow.

Previous works have used LDPC and 2-D Reed Solomon (2DRS) codes with Merkle trees to mitigate DA attacks. These codes perform well across various metrics such as DA detection probability and communication cost. However, these codes are difficult to apply to blockchains with large blocks due to large decoding complexity and coding fraud proof size (2D-RS codes), and intractable code guarantees for large code lengths (LDPC codes). In this paper, we focus on large block size applications and address the above challenges by proposing the novel Polar Coded Merkle Tree (PCMT): a Merkle tree encoded using the encoding graph of polar codes. We provide a specialized polar code design algorithm called Sampling Efficient Freezing and an algorithm to prune the polar encoding graph. We demonstrate that the PCMT built using the above techniques results in a better DA detection probability and communication cost compared to LDPC codes, has a lower coding fraud proof size compared to LDPC and 2D-RS codes, provides tractable code guarantees at large code lengths (similar to 2D-RS codes), and has comparable decoding complexity to 2D-RS and LDPC codes.

Researchers and practitioners extensively proposed various neural network architectures for searching and modeling feature interactions. However, we observe that different datasets favor different neural network architectures and feature interaction types, suggesting that different feature interaction learning methods may have their own unique advantages. Inspired by this observation, we propose AdaEnsemble: a Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts (SparseMoE) architecture that can leverage the strengths of heterogeneous feature interaction experts and adaptively learns the routing to a sparse combination of experts for each example, allowing us to build a dynamic hierarchy of the feature interactions of different types and orders. To further improve the prediction accuracy and inference efficiency, we incorporate the dynamic early exiting mechanism for feature interaction depth selection. The AdaEnsemble can adaptively choose the feature interaction depth and find the corresponding SparseMoE stacking layer to exit and compute prediction from. Therefore, our proposed architecture inherits the advantages of the exponential combinations of sparsely gated experts within SparseMoE layers and further dynamically selects the optimal feature interaction depth without executing deeper layers. We implement the proposed AdaEnsemble and evaluate its performance on real-world datasets. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of AdaEnsemble over state-of-the-art models. ",

To address this issue, the proposed methodology employs a sorting algorithm to rearrange the elements of the adjacency matrix of a complex graph in a specific order. The resulting sorted adjacency matrix is then used as input for feature extraction and machine learning algorithms to classify the networks.

    "abstract": "Objective Kalman filtering has previously been applied to track neural model states and parameters, particularly at the scale relevant to EEG. However, this approach lacks a reliable method to determine the initial filter conditions and assumes that the distribution of states remains Gaussian. This study presents an alternative, data-driven method to track the states and parameters of neural mass models (NMMs) from EEG recordings using deep learning techniques, specifically an LSTM neural network. Approach An LSTM filter was trained on simulated EEG data generated by a neural mass model using a wide range of parameters. With an appropriately customised loss function, the LSTM filter can learn the behaviour of NMMs. As a result, it can output the state vector and parameters of NMMs given observation data as the input. Main Results Test results using simulated data yielded correlations with R squared of around 0.99 and verified that the method is robust to noise and can be more accurate than a nonlinear Kalman filter when the initial conditions of the Kalman filter are not accurate. As an example of real-world application, the LSTM filter was also applied to real EEG data that included epileptic seizures, and revealed changes in connectivity strength parameters at the beginnings of seizures. Significance Tracking the state vector and parameters of mathematical brain models is of great importance in the area of brain modelling, monitoring, imaging and control. This approach has no need to specify the initial state vector and parameters, which is very difficult to do in practice because many of the variables being estimated cannot be measured directly in physiological experiments. This method may be applied using any neural mass model and, therefore, provides a general, novel, efficient approach to estimate brain model variables that are often difficult to measure. ",

However, their operational interpretations in the privacy context are unclear. In this paper, we relate the notion of probabilistic information privacy (IP) to several IT privacy metrics based on $f$-divergences. We interpret probabilistic IP under both the detection and estimation frameworks and link it to differential privacy, thus allowing a precise operational interpretation of these IT privacy metrics. We show that the $\\chi^2$-divergence privacy metric is stronger than those based on total variation distance and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Therefore, we further develop a data-driven empirical risk framework based on the $\\chi^2$-divergence privacy metric and realized using deep neural networks.

To address that, we propose Hode, an offloaded video analytic framework that utilizes multiple edge nodes in proximity to expedite pedestrian detection with high-resolution inputs. Specifically, Hode can intelligently split high-resolution images into respective regions and then offload them to distributed edge nodes to perform pedestrian detection in parallel. A spatio-temporal flow filtering method is designed to enable context-aware region partitioning, as well as a DRL-based scheduling algorithm to allow accuracy-aware load balance among heterogeneous edge nodes.

In these attacks, the attacker injects malicious packets into the SDN network to affect the services and performance of the SDN controller and overflow the capacity of the SDN switches. Such attacks have been shown to ultimately stop the network functioning in real-time, leading to network breakdowns. There have been significant works on detecting and defending against similar DoS attacks in non-SDN networks, but detection and protection techniques for SDN against packet injection attacks are still in their infancy. Furthermore, many of the proposed solutions have been shown to be easily by-passed by simple modifications to the attacking packets or by altering the attacking profile. In this paper, we develop novel Graph Convolutional Neural Network models and algorithms for grouping network nodes/users into security classes by learning from network data. We start with two simple classes - nodes that engage in suspicious packet injection attacks and nodes that are not. From these classes, we then partition the network into separate segments with different security policies using distributed Ryu controllers in an SDN network. We show in experiments on an emulated SDN that our detection solution outperforms alternative approaches with above 99\\% detection accuracy on various types (both old and new) of injection attacks. More importantly, our mitigation solution maintains continuous functions of non-compromised nodes while isolating compromised/suspicious nodes in real-time.

First, we design a disparity estimation network (DispNet) with a coarse-to-fine structure to predict disparity maps from different view combinations by performing multi-view feature matching to learn the correspondences more effectively. As occlusions may cause the violation of photo-consistency, we design an occlusion prediction network (OccNet) to predict the occlusion maps, which are used as the element-wise weights of photometric loss to solve the occlusion issue and assist the disparity learning. With the disparity maps estimated by multiple input combinations, we propose a disparity fusion strategy based on the estimated errors with effective occlusion handling to obtain the final disparity map. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both the dense and sparse LF images, and also has better generalization ability to the real-world LF images. ",

    "abstract": "To prevent implicit privacy disclosure in sharing gradients among data owners (DOs) under federated learning (FL), differential privacy (DP) and its variants have become a common practice to offer formal privacy guarantees with low overheads. However, individual DOs generally tend to inject larger DP noises for stronger privacy provisions (which entails severe degradation of model utility), while the curator (i.e., aggregation server) aims to minimize the overall effect of added random noises for satisfactory model performance. To address this conflicting goal, we propose a novel dynamic privacy pricing (DyPP) game which allows DOs to sell individual privacy (by lowering the scale of locally added DP noise) for differentiated economic compensations (offered by the curator), thereby enhancing FL model utility. Considering multi-dimensional information asymmetry among players (e.g., DO's data distribution and privacy preference, and curator's maximum affordable payment) as well as their varying private information in distinct FL tasks, it is hard to directly attain the Nash equilibrium of the mixed-strategy DyPP game. Alternatively, we devise a fast reinforcement learning algorithm with two layers to quickly learn the optimal mixed noise-saving strategy of DOs and the optimal mixed pricing strategy of the curator without prior knowledge of players' private information. Experiments on real datasets validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme in terms of faster convergence speed and enhanced FL model utility with lower payment costs. ",

Although XR users require stringent throughput and latency performance, operators do not lose significant additional network capacity when adding XR users to an eMBB dominated network. For instance, adding an XR service at 45 Mbps with 10 ms packet delay budget, yields close to a 45 Mbps drop in eMBB capacity. In an XR only network layer, we show how the capacity in number of supported XR users depends significantly on the rate but also the latency budget. We show also how the XR service capacity is significantly reduced in the mixed service setting as the system goes into full load and other-cell interference becomes significant. The presented results can be used by cellular service providers to assess their networks performance of XR traffic based on their current eMBB performance, or as input to dimensioning to be able to serve certain XR traffic loads.

    "abstract": "This paper describes a novel Python package, named causalgraph, for modeling and saving causal graphs embedded in knowledge graphs. The package has been designed to provide an interface between causal disciplines such as causal discovery and causal inference. With this package, users can create and save causal graphs and export the generated graphs for use in other graph-based packages. The main advantage of the proposed package is its ability to facilitate the linking of additional information and metadata to causal structures. In addition, the package offers a variety of functions for graph modeling and plotting, such as editing, adding, and deleting nodes and edges. It is also compatible with widely used graph data science libraries such as NetworkX and Tigramite and incorporates a specially developed causalgraph ontology in the background. This paper provides an overview of the package's main features, functionality, and usage examples, enabling the reader to use the package effectively in practice. ",

    "abstract": "Practical uses of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the real world have demonstrated the importance of embedding moral choices into intelligent agents. They have also highlighted that defining top-down ethical constraints on AI according to any one type of morality is extremely challenging and can pose risks. A bottom-up learning approach may be more appropriate for studying and developing ethical behavior in AI agents. In particular, we believe that an interesting and insightful starting point is the analysis of emergent behavior of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents that act according to a predefined set of moral rewards in social dilemmas. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the choices made by intrinsically-motivated RL agents whose rewards are based on moral theories. We aim to design reward structures that are simplified yet representative of a set of key ethical systems. Therefore, we first define moral reward functions that distinguish between consequence- and norm-based agents, between morality based on societal norms or internal virtues, and between single- and mixed-virtue (e.g., multi-objective) methodologies. Then, we evaluate our approach by modeling repeated dyadic interactions between learning moral agents in three iterated social dilemma games (Prisoner's Dilemma, Volunteer's Dilemma and Stag Hunt). We analyze the impact of different types of morality on the emergence of cooperation, defection or exploitation, and the corresponding social outcomes. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for the development of moral agents in artificial and mixed human-AI societies. ",

    "abstract": "Benefiting from the injection of human prior knowledge, graphs, as derived discrete data, are semantically dense so that models can efficiently learn the semantic information from such data. Accordingly, graph neural networks (GNNs) indeed achieve impressive success in various fields. Revisiting the GNN learning paradigms, we discover that the relationship between human expertise and the knowledge modeled by GNNs still confuses researchers. To this end, we introduce motivating experiments and derive an empirical observation that the human expertise is gradually learned by the GNNs in general domains. By further observing the ramifications of introducing expertise logic into graph representation learning, we conclude that leading the GNNs to learn human expertise can improve the model performance. By exploring the intrinsic mechanism behind such observations, we elaborate the Structural Causal Model for the graph representation learning paradigm. Following the theoretical guidance, we innovatively introduce the auxiliary causal logic learning paradigm to improve the model to learn the expertise logic causally related to the graph representation learning task. In practice, the counterfactual technique is further performed to tackle the insufficient training issue during optimization. Plentiful experiments on the crafted and real-world domains support the consistent effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "The need for a privacy management layer in today's systems started to manifest with the emergence of new systems for privacy-preserving analytics and privacy compliance. As a result, we began to see many independent efforts emerge that try to provide system support for privacy. Recently, the scope of privacy solutions used in systems has expanded to encompass more complex techniques such as Differential Privacy (DP). The use of these solutions in large-scale systems imposes new challenges and requirements. Careful planning and coordination are necessary to ensure that privacy guarantees are maintained across a wide range of heterogeneous applications and data systems. This requires new solutions for managing shared application state and allocating scarce and non-replenishable privacy resources. In this paper, we introduce Cohere, a new data management system that simplifies the use of DP in large-scale systems. Cohere implements a unified interface that allows heterogeneous applications to operate on a unified view of users' data. Cohere further extends existing accounting systems with the ability to manage and optimally allocate shared privacy resources, i.e., budget, under complex preferences. We show that Cohere can effectively enable advanced privacy solutions in existing large-scale systems with minimal modifications to existing data management systems and with moderate overhead. ",

    "abstract": "We identify a subtle security issue that impacts the design of smart contracts, because agents may themselves deploy smart contracts (side contracts). Typically, equilibria of games are analyzed in vitro, under the assumption that players cannot arbitrarily commit to strategies. However, equilibria thus obtained do not hold in general in vivo, when games are deployed on a blockchain. Being able to deploy side contracts changes fundamental game-theoretic assumptions by inducing a meta-game wherein agents strategize to deploy the best contracts. Not taking side contracts into account thus fails to capture an important aspect of deploying smart contracts in practice. A game that remains secure when the players can deploy side contracts is said to be side contract resilient. We demonstrate the non-triviality of side contract resilience by analyzing two smart contracts for decentralized commerce. These contracts have the same intended functionality, but we show that only one is side contract resilient. We then demonstrate a side contract attack on first-price auctions, which are the transaction mechanisms used by most major blockchains. We show that an agent may deploy a contract ensuring their transaction is included in the next block at almost zero cost while forcing most other agents to enter into a lottery for the remaining block space. This benefits all the users, but is detrimental to the miners. This might be cause for re-evaluation of the use of auctions in transaction fee mechanisms. We show that the attack works under certain conditions that hold with high probability from natural distributions. The attack also works against the transaction mechanism EIP-1559. Our work highlights an issue that is necessary to address to ensure the secure deployment of smart contracts and suggests that other contracts already deployed on major blockchains may be susceptible to these attacks.

In many applications, for example, in systems biology and epidemiology, CRN parameters such as the kinetic reaction rates can be used as control inputs to steer the system toward a given target. Unfortunately, the resulting optimal control problem is nonlinear, therefore, computationally very challenging. We address this issue by introducing an optimality-preserving reduction algorithm for CRNs. The algorithm partitions the original state variables into a reduced set of macro-variables for which one can define a reduced optimal control problem from which one can exactly recover the solution of the original control problem. Notably, the reduction algorithm runs with polynomial time complexity in the size of the CRN. We use this result to reduce reachability and control problems of large-scale protein-interaction networks and vaccination models with hundreds of thousands of state variables. ",

    "abstract": "Expert demonstrations are a rich source of supervision for training visual robotic manipulation policies, but imitation learning methods often require either a large number of demonstrations or expensive online expert supervision to learn reactive closed-loop behaviors. In this work, we introduce SPARTN (Synthetic Perturbations for Augmenting Robot Trajectories via NeRF): a fully-offline data augmentation scheme for improving robot policies that use eye-in-hand cameras. Our approach leverages neural radiance fields (NeRFs) to synthetically inject corrective noise into visual demonstrations, using NeRFs to generate perturbed viewpoints while simultaneously calculating the corrective actions. This requires no additional expert supervision or environment interaction, and distills the geometric information in NeRFs into a real-time reactive RGB-only policy. In a simulated 6-DoF visual grasping benchmark, SPARTN improves success rates by 2.8$\\times$ over imitation learning without the corrective augmentations and even outperforms some methods that use online supervision. It additionally closes the gap between RGB-only and RGB-D success rates, eliminating the previous need for depth sensors. In real-world 6-DoF robotic grasping experiments from limited human demonstrations, our method improves absolute success rates by $22.5\\%$ on average, including objects that are traditionally challenging for depth-based methods.

We apply this approach to a case study in predicting the potential toxicity of a small molecule based on its molecular structure, a challenging task for machine learning in life sciences chemistry. Our approach improves on the state of the art, and moreover has several additional benefits. First, we are able to show that the model learns to focus attention on more meaningful chemical groups when making predictions with ontology pre-training than without, paving a path towards greater robustness and interpretability. Second, the training time is reduced after ontology pre-training, indicating that the model is better placed to learn what matters for toxicity prediction with the ontology pre-training than without.

Existing methods to deal with such cross-dependencies usually rely on reductions to BNs without cycles. These approaches are fragile to generalize, since their justifications are intermingled with additional knowledge about the application context. In this paper, we present a foundational study regarding semantics for cyclic BNs that are generic and conservatively extend the cycle-free setting. First, we propose constraint-based semantics that specify requirements for full joint distributions over a BN to be consistent with the local conditional probabilities and independencies.

Results showed that ViTMem performed equal to or better than state-of-the-art models on all data sets. Additional semantic level analyses revealed that ViTMem is particularly sensitive to the semantic content that drives memorability in images.

Here, we propose a self-supervised learning to directly tackle a nonlinear inverse problem involving an unknown function. In particular, we focus on an inverse problem derived in Photoacoustic Tomograpy (PAT) which is a hybrid medical imaging with high resolution and contrast. PAT can be modelled based on the wave equation. The measured data is the solution of the equation restricted to the surface and the initial pressure of the equation contains the biological information on the object of interest. The speed of sound wave in the equation is unknown. Our goal is to determine the initial pressure and the speed of sound wave simultaneously. Under a simple assumption that the sound speed is a function of the initial pressure, the problem becomes a nonlinear inverse problem involving an unknown function. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs successfully. ",

While these result in model placements that train fast on data (i.e., low step times), learning-based model-parallelism is time-consuming, taking many hours or days to create a placement plan of operators on devices. We present the Baechi system, the first to adopt an algorithmic approach to the placement problem for running machine learning training graphs on small clusters of memory-constrained devices. We integrate our implementation of Baechi into two popular open-source learning frameworks: TensorFlow and PyTorch. Our experimental results using GPUs show that: (i) Baechi generates placement plans 654 X - 206K X faster than state-of-the-art learning-based approaches, and (ii) Baechi-placed model's step (training) time is comparable to expert placements in PyTorch, and only up to 6.2% worse than expert placements in TensorFlow. We prove mathematically that our two algorithms are within a constant factor of the optimal. Our work shows that compared to learning-based approaches, algorithmic approaches can face different challenges for adaptation to Machine learning systems, but also they offer proven bounds, and significant performance benefits.

    "abstract": "In the past decade, advances in deep learning have resulted in breakthroughs in a variety of areas, including computer vision, natural language understanding, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning. Specialized, high-performing neural architectures are crucial to the success of deep learning in these areas. Neural architecture search (NAS), the process of automating the design of neural architectures for a given task, is an inevitable next step in automating machine learning and has already outpaced the best human-designed architectures on many tasks. In the past few years, research in NAS has been progressing rapidly, with over 1000 papers released since 2020. In this survey, we provide an organized and comprehensive guide to neural architecture search. We give a taxonomy of search spaces, algorithms, and speedup techniques, and we discuss resources such as benchmarks, best practices, other surveys, and open-source libraries. ",

    "abstract": "We apply Fourier neural operators (FNOs), a state-of-the-art operator learning technique, to forecast the temporal evolution of experimentally measured velocity fields. FNOs are a recently developed machine learning method capable of approximating solution operators to systems of partial differential equations through data alone. The learned FNO solution operator can be evaluated in milliseconds, potentially enabling faster-than-real-time modeling for predictive flow control in physical systems. Here we use FNOs to predict how physical fluid flows evolve in time, training with particle image velocimetry measurements depicting cylinder wakes in the subcritical vortex shedding regime. We train separate FNOs at Reynolds numbers ranging from Re = 240 to Re = 3060 and study how increasingly turbulent flow phenomena impact prediction accuracy. We focus here on a short prediction horizon of ten non-dimensionalized time-steps, as would be relevant for problems of predictive flow control. We find that FNOs are capable of accurately predicting the evolution of experimental velocity fields throughout the range of Reynolds numbers tested (L2 norm error < 0.1) despite being provided with limited and imperfect flow observations. Given these results, we conclude that this method holds significant potential for real-time predictive flow control of physical systems. ",

    "abstract": "Binary neural networks, i.e., neural networks whose parameters and activations are constrained to only two possible values, offer a compelling avenue for the deployment of deep learning models on energy- and memory-limited devices. However, their training, architectural design, and hyperparameter tuning remain challenging as these involve multiple computationally expensive combinatorial optimization problems. Here we introduce quantum hypernetworks as a mechanism to train binary neural networks on quantum computers, which unify the search over parameters, hyperparameters, and architectures in a single optimization loop. Through classical simulations, we demonstrate that of our approach effectively finds optimal parameters, hyperparameters and architectural choices with high probability on classification problems including a two-dimensional Gaussian dataset and a scaled-down version of the MNIST handwritten digits. We represent our quantum hypernetworks as variational quantum circuits, and find that an optimal circuit depth maximizes the probability of finding performant binary neural networks. Our unified approach provides an immense scope for other applications in the field of machine learning. ",

    "abstract": "Pathological brain lesions exhibit diverse appearance in brain images, in terms of intensity, texture, shape, size, and location. Comprehensive sets of data and annotations are difficult to acquire. Therefore, unsupervised anomaly detection approaches have been proposed using only normal data for training, with the aim of detecting outlier anomalous voxels at test time. Denoising methods, for instance classical denoising autoencoders (DAEs) and more recently emerging diffusion models, are a promising approach, however naive application of pixelwise noise leads to poor anomaly detection performance. We show that optimization of the spatial resolution and magnitude of the noise improves the performance of different model training regimes, with similar noise parameter adjustments giving good performance for both DAEs and diffusion models. Visual inspection of the reconstructions suggests that the training noise influences the trade-off between the extent of the detail that is reconstructed and the extent of erasure of anomalies, both of which contribute to better anomaly detection performance. We validate our findings on two real-world datasets (tumor detection in brain MRI and hemorrhage/ischemia/tumor detection in brain CT), showing good detection on diverse anomaly appearances. Overall, we find that a DAE trained with coarse noise is a fast and simple method that gives state-of-the-art accuracy. Diffusion models applied to anomaly detection are as yet in their infancy and provide a promising avenue for further research. ",

    "abstract": "With the increasing availability of data for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), Deep Learning (DL) techniques are now the subject of considerable attention for this application, often achieving more accurate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) predictions. However, one of the major challenges for DL techniques resides in the difficulty of obtaining large amounts of labelled data on industrial systems. To overcome this lack of labelled data, an emerging learning technique is considered in our work: Self-Supervised Learning, a sub-category of unsupervised learning approaches. This paper aims to investigate whether pre-training DL models in a self-supervised way on unlabelled sensors data can be useful for RUL estimation with only Few-Shots Learning, i.e. with scarce labelled data. In this research, a fatigue damage prognostics problem is addressed, through the estimation of the RUL of aluminum alloy panels (typical of aerospace structures) subject to fatigue cracks from strain gauge data. Synthetic datasets composed of strain data are used allowing to extensively investigate the influence of the dataset size on the predictive performance. Results show that the self-supervised pre-trained models are able to significantly outperform the non-pre-trained models in downstream RUL prediction task, and with less computational expense, showing promising results in prognostic tasks when only limited labelled data is available.

    "title": "Pneumonia Detection in Chest X-Ray Images : Handling Class Imbalance",
    "abstract": "People all over the globe are affected by pneumonia but deaths due to it are highest in Sub-Saharan Asia and South Asia. In recent years, the overall incidence and mortality rate of pneumonia regardless of the utilization of effective vaccines and compelling antibiotics has escalated. Thus, pneumonia remains a disease that needs spry prevention and treatment. The widespread prevalence of pneumonia has caused the research community to come up with a framework that helps detect, diagnose and analyze diseases accurately and promptly. One of the major hurdles faced by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) research community is the lack of publicly available datasets for chest diseases, including pneumonia . Secondly, few of the available datasets are highly imbalanced (normal examples are over sampled, while samples with ailment are in severe minority) making the problem even more challenging. In this article we present a novel framework for the detection of pneumonia. The novelty of the proposed methodology lies in the tackling of class imbalance problem. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), specifically a combination of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and Wasserstein GAN gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) was applied on the minority class ``Pneumonia'' for augmentation, whereas Random Under-Sampling (RUS) was done on the majority class ``No Findings'' to deal with the imbalance problem. The ChestX-Ray8 dataset, one of the biggest datasets, is used to validate the performance of the proposed framework. The learning phase is completed using transfer learning on state-of-the-art deep learning models i.e. ResNet-50, Xception, and VGG-16. Results obtained exceed state-of-the-art. ",

Transition probabilities of the chain depends on a parameter, called the activity, which is used to assign higher stationary probability to graphs with more triangles. In previous work we proved ergodicity of the triangle switch chain for regular graphs. Here we prove ergodicity for all sequences with minimum degree at least 3, and show rapid mixing of the chain when the activity and the maximum degree are not too large. As far as we are aware, this is the first rigorous analysis of a Markov chain algorithm for generating graphs from a a known non-uniform distribution. ",

    "abstract": "Despite $1/f$ noise being ubiquitous in both natural and artificial systems, no general explanations for the phenomenon have received widespread acceptance. One well-known system where $1/f$ noise has been observed in is the human brain, with this 'noise' proposed by some to be important to the healthy function of the brain. As deep neural networks (DNNs) are loosely modelled after the human brain, and as they start to achieve human-level performance in specific tasks, it might be worth investigating if the same $1/f$ noise is present in these artificial networks as well. Indeed, we find the existence of $1/f$ noise in DNNs - specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks modelled on real world dataset - by measuring the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of different activations within the network in response to a sequential input of natural language. This was done in analogy to the measurement of $1/f$ noise in human brains with techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We further examine the exponent values in the $1/f$ noise in \"inner\" and \"outer\" activations in the LSTM cell, finding some resemblance in the variations of the exponents in the fMRI signal. In addition, comparing the values of the exponent at \"rest\" compared to when performing \"tasks\" of the LSTM network, we find a similar trend to that of the human brain where the exponent while performing tasks is less negative.
