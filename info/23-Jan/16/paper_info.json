    "title": "Jamming Attacks on Decentralized Federated Learning in General Multi-Hop  Wireless Networks",
    "abstract": "Decentralized federated learning (DFL) is an effective approach to train a deep learning model at multiple nodes over a multi-hop network, without the need of a server having direct connections to all nodes. In general, as long as nodes are connected potentially via multiple hops, the DFL process will eventually allow each node to experience the effects of models from all other nodes via either direct connections or multi-hop paths, and thus is able to train a high-fidelity model at each node. We consider an effective attack that uses jammers to prevent the model exchanges between nodes. There are two attack scenarios. First, the adversary can attack any link under a certain budget. Once attacked, two end nodes of a link cannot exchange their models. Secondly, some jammers with limited jamming ranges are deployed in the network and a jammer can only jam nodes within its jamming range. Once a directional link is attacked, the receiver node cannot receive the model from the transmitter node. We design algorithms to select links to be attacked for both scenarios. For the second scenario, we also design algorithms to deploy jammers at optimal locations so that they can attack critical nodes and achieve the highest impact on the DFL process. We evaluate these algorithms by using wireless signal classification over a large network area as the use case and identify how these attack mechanisms exploits various learning, connectivity, and sensing aspects. We show that the DFL performance can be significantly reduced by jamming attacks launched in a wireless network and characterize the attack surface as a vulnerability study before the safe deployment of DFL over wireless networks.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are both known for their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. Therefore, researchers in the recent past have extensively studied the robustness and defense of DNNs and SNNs under adversarial attacks. Compared to accurate SNNs (AccSNN), approximate SNNs (AxSNNs) are known to be up to 4X more energy-efficient for ultra-low power applications. Unfortunately, the robustness of AxSNNs under adversarial attacks is yet unexplored. In this paper, we first extensively analyze the robustness of AxSNNs with different structural parameters and approximation levels under two gradient-based and two neuromorphic attacks. Then, we propose two novel defense methods, i.e., precision scaling and approximate quantization-aware filtering (AQF), for securing AxSNNs. We evaluated the effectiveness of these two defense methods using both static and neuromorphic datasets. Our results demonstrate that AxSNNs are more prone to adversarial attacks than AccSNNs, but precision scaling and AQF significantly improve the robustness of AxSNNs. For instance, a PGD attack on AxSNN results in a 72\\% accuracy loss compared to AccSNN without any attack, whereas the same attack on the precision-scaled AxSNN leads to only a 17\\% accuracy loss in the static MNIST dataset (4X robustness improvement). Similarly, a Sparse Attack on AxSNN leads to a 77\\% accuracy loss when compared to AccSNN without any attack, whereas the same attack on an AxSNN with AQF leads to only a 2\\% accuracy loss in the neuromorphic DVS128 Gesture dataset (38X robustness improvement).

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks have made breakthroughs in computer vision by lending themselves to neuromorphic hardware. However, the neuromorphic hardware lacks parallelism and hence, limits the throughput and hardware acceleration of SNNs on edge devices. To address this problem, many systolic-array SNN accelerators (systolicSNNs) have been proposed recently, but their reliability is still a major concern. In this paper, we first extensively analyze the impact of permanent faults on the SystolicSNNs. Then, we present a novel fault mitigation method, i.e., fault-aware threshold voltage optimization in retraining (FalVolt). FalVolt optimizes the threshold voltage for each layer in retraining to achieve the classification accuracy close to the baseline in the presence of faults. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mitigation, we classify both static (i.e., MNIST) and neuromorphic datasets (i.e., N-MNIST and DVS Gesture) on a 256x256 systolicSNN with stuck-at faults. We empirically show that the classification accuracy of a systolicSNN drops significantly even at extremely low fault rates (as low as 0.012\\%). Our proposed FalVolt mitigation method improves the performance of systolicSNNs by enabling them to operate at fault rates of up to 60\\%, with a negligible drop in classification accuracy (as low as 0.1\\%). Our results show that FalVolt is 2x faster compared to other state-of-the-art techniques common in artificial neural networks (ANNs), such as fault-aware pruning and retraining without threshold voltage optimization.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been making big waves in the machine learning community within the past few years. The impressive scalability of LLMs due to the advent of deep learning can be seen as a continuation of empiricist lingusitic methods, as opposed to rule-based linguistic methods that are grounded in a nativist perspective. Current LLMs are generally inaccessible to resource-constrained researchers, due to a variety of factors including closed source code. This work argues that this lack of accessibility could instill a nativist bias in researchers new to computational linguistics, given that new researchers may only have rule-based, nativist approaches to study to produce new work. Also, given that there are numerous critics of deep learning claiming that LLMs and related methods may soon lose their relevancy, we speculate that such an event could trigger a new wave of nativism in the language processing community. To prevent such a dramatic shift and placing favor in hybrid methods of rules and deep learning, we call upon researchers to open source their LLM code wherever possible to allow both empircist and hybrid approaches to remain accessible.

We also provide design guidelines for the laser communication terminal manufacturers in the form of maximum tolerable value of LISL setup delay for which the FSOSN based on Starlink's Phase I satellite constellation will be meaningful to use for low-latency long-distance inter-continental data communications.

    "abstract": "Intersections are essential road infrastructures for traffic in modern metropolises; however, they can also be the bottleneck of traffic flows due to traffic incidents or the absence of traffic coordination mechanisms such as traffic lights. Thus, various control and coordination mechanisms that are beyond traditional control methods have been proposed to improve the efficiency of intersection traffic. Amongst these methods, the control of foreseeable hybrid traffic that consists of human-driven vehicles (HVs) and robot vehicles (RVs) has recently emerged. We propose a decentralized reinforcement learning approach for the control and coordination of hybrid traffic at real-world, complex intersections--a topic that has not been previously explored. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, we show that using 5% RVs, we can prevent congestion formation inside the intersection under the actual traffic demand of 700 vehicles per hour. In contrast, without RVs, congestion starts to develop when the traffic demand reaches as low as 200 vehicles per hour. Further performance gains (reduced waiting time of vehicles at the intersection) are obtained as the RV penetration rate increases. When there exist more than 50% RVs in traffic, our method starts to outperform traffic signals on the average waiting time of all vehicles at the intersection. Our method is also robust against both blackout events and sudden RV percentage drops, and enjoys excellent generalizablility, which is illustrated by its successful deployment in two unseen intersections.

    "title": "Incremental Dead State Detection in Logarithmic Time",
    "abstract": "Identifying live and dead states in an abstract transition system is a recurring problem in formal verification. However, state-of-the-art graph algorithms for maintaining reachability information incrementally (that is, as states are visited and before the entire state space is explored) assume that new edges can be added from any state at any time, whereas in many applications, outgoing edges are added from each state as it is explored. To formalize the latter situation, we propose guided incremental digraphs (GIDs), incremental graphs which support labeling closed states (states which will not receive further outgoing edges). Our main result is that dead state detection in GIDs is solvable in $O(\\log m)$ time per edge update for $m$ edges, improving upon $O(\\sqrt{m})$ per edge due to Bender, Fineman, Gilbert, and Tarjan (BFGT) for general incremental directed graphs. We introduce two algorithms for GIDs: one establishing the logarithmic time bound, and a second algorithm to explore a lazy heuristics-based approach. To demonstrate applicability, we show how GIDs can be used to lazily decide regular expression constraints in SMT applications. To enable an apples-to-apples experimental comparison, we implemented both algorithms, two naive baselines, and the state-of-the-art BFGT baseline using a common directed graph interface in Rust. Our evaluation shows $110$-$530$x speedups over BFGT for the largest input graphs over a range of graph classes, random graphs, and graphs arising from regular expression benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Coordination is one of the most difficult aspects of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). One reason is that agents normally choose their actions independently of one another. In order to see coordination strategies emerging from the combination of independent policies, the recent research has focused on the use of a centralized function (CF) that learns each agent's contribution to the team reward. However, the structure in which the environment is presented to the agents and to the CF is typically overlooked. We have observed that the features used to describe the coordination problem can be represented as vertex features of a latent graph structure. Here, we present TransfQMix, a new approach that uses transformers to leverage this latent structure and learn better coordination policies. Our transformer agents perform a graph reasoning over the state of the observable entities. Our transformer Q-mixer learns a monotonic mixing-function from a larger graph that includes the internal and external states of the agents. TransfQMix is designed to be entirely transferable, meaning that same parameters can be used to control and train larger or smaller teams of agents. This enables to deploy promising approaches to save training time and derive general policies in MARL, such as transfer learning, zero-shot transfer, and curriculum learning. We report TransfQMix's performances in the Spread and StarCraft II environments. In both settings, it outperforms state-of-the-art Q-Learning models, and it demonstrates effectiveness in solving problems that other methods can not solve. ",

    "abstract": "The recently proposed Vision transformers (ViTs) have shown very impressive empirical performance in various computer vision tasks, and they are viewed as an important type of foundation model. However, ViTs are typically constructed with large-scale sizes, which then severely hinder their potential deployment in many practical resources-constrained applications. To mitigate this challenging problem, structured pruning is a promising solution to compress model size and enable practical efficiency. However, unlike its current popularity for CNNs and RNNs, structured pruning for ViT models is little explored. In this paper, we propose GOHSP, a unified framework of Graph and Optimization-based Structured Pruning for ViT models. We first develop a graph-based ranking for measuring the importance of attention heads, and the extracted importance information is further integrated to an optimization-based procedure to impose the heterogeneous structured sparsity patterns on the ViT models. Experimental results show that our proposed GOHSP demonstrates excellent compression performance. On CIFAR-10 dataset, our approach can bring 40% parameters reduction with no accuracy loss for ViT-Small model. On ImageNet dataset, with 30% and 35% sparsity ratio for DeiT-Tiny and DeiT-Small models, our approach achieves 1.65% and 0.76% accuracy increase over the existing structured pruning methods, respectively.

    "abstract": "We study concentration phenomena in gossip opinion dynamics over random graphs. In the model, a network is generated from a random graph with independent edges, and agents interact pairwise randomly over the network. During the process, regular agents average the opinions of themselves and their neighbors as updates, whereas stubborn agents do not change opinions. To approximate the original process, we introduce gossip dynamics over an averaged graph, obtained by averaging all possible networks generated from the random graph. Using concentration inequalities, we derive high-probability bounds for the difference between the expected final opinions of the regular agents in the original gossip process and those in the dynamics over the averaged graph. The result shows that the expected final opinions for most networks generated from the random graph are close to the final opinions of the averaged graph, which are convex combinations of stubborn-agent states with weights depending on link probability between regular and stubborn agents. We further show how such concentration can help study the effect of network topology on the expected final opinions in two cases, using matrix perturbation theory: (i) When the influence of stubborn agents is large, the original expected final opinions polarize. (ii) When the influence of stubborn agents is small, the expected final opinions are close to each other. With the help of concentration inequalities of Markov chains, we obtain high-probability bounds for the difference between the time average of agent states in the original process and the expected final opinions of the averaged graph. As an application, we apply the results to gossip dynamics over stochastic block models, which generate networks with community structure, and derive quantitative characterization of the opinion profile.

The major classifier vectors are then distributed to all clients and the local training of each client is Contrasted with Major Classifier vectors (FedCMC), so the local model is not prone to overfitting to the local label distribution. FedCMC requires only a small amount of additional transfer of classifier parameters without any leakage of raw data, extracted representations, and label distributions.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown its huge potential in wireless scenarios where parameter learning is required given the dynamic nature of such context.

    "abstract": "Medical images are generally acquired with limited field-of-view (FOV), which could lead to incomplete regions of interest (ROI), and thus impose a great challenge on medical image analysis. This is particularly evident for the learning-based multi-target landmark detection, where algorithms could be misleading to learn primarily the variation of background due to the varying FOV, failing the detection of targets. Based on learning a navigation policy, instead of predicting targets directly, reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods have the potential totackle this challenge in an efficient manner. Inspired by this, in this work we propose a multi-agent RL framework for simultaneous multi-target landmark detection. This framework is aimed to learn from incomplete or (and) complete images to form an implicit knowledge of global structure, which is consolidated during the training stage for the detection of targets from either complete or incomplete test images. To further explicitly exploit the global structural information from incomplete images, we propose to embed a shape model into the RL process. With this prior knowledge, the proposed RL model can not only localize dozens of targetssimultaneously, but also work effectively and robustly in the presence of incomplete images. We validated the applicability and efficacy of the proposed method on various multi-target detection tasks with incomplete images from practical clinics, using body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), cardiac MRI and head CT datasets. Results showed that our method could predict whole set of landmarks with incomplete training images up to 80% missing proportion (average distance error 2.29 cm on body DXA), and could detect unseen landmarks in regions with missing image information outside FOV of target images (average distance error 6.84 mm on 3D half-head CT).

These conservative strategies can negatively impact AV's performance and significantly slow traffic throughput. Therefore, to avoid conservatism, we design an interaction-aware motion planner for the ego vehicle (AV) that interacts with surrounding vehicles to perform complex maneuvers in a locally optimal manner. Our planner uses a neural network-based interactive trajectory predictor and analytically integrates it with model predictive control (MPC). We solve the MPC optimization using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and prove the algorithm's convergence. We provide an empirical study and compare our method with a baseline heuristic method. ",

However, most existing studies still rely on the full history features or full-fledged address transaction networks, thus cannot meet the requirements of early malicious address detection, which is urgent but seldom discussed by existing studies. To detect fraud behaviors of malicious addresses in the early stage, we present Evolve Path Tracer, which consists of Evolve Path Encoder LSTM, Evolve Path Graph GCN, and Hierarchical Survival Predictor. Specifically, in addition to the general address features, we propose asset transfer paths and corresponding path graphs to characterize early transaction patterns. Further, since the transaction patterns are changing rapidly during the early stage, we propose Evolve Path Encoder LSTM and Evolve Path Graph GCN to encode asset transfer path and path graph under an evolving structure setting. Hierarchical Survival Predictor then predicts addresses' labels with nice scalability and faster prediction speed. We investigate the effectiveness and versatility of Evolve Path Tracer on three real-world illicit bitcoin datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that Evolve Path Tracer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Extensive scalability experiments demonstrate the model's adaptivity under a dynamic prediction setting. ",

But the quality of the result is constrained by the limitations of the model and of the Kalman filter. We observe that the data flow in a system consisting of a model and the Kalman filter can be interpreted to be the same as the data flow in a recurrent neural network (RNN). Thus, instead of building more sophisticated models and data assimilation methods, we want to train a RNN to approximate the dynamics of the response of the FMC sensor to a time series of environmental data. Because standard AI approaches did not converge to reasonable solutions, we pre-train the RNN with special initial weights devised to turn it into a numerical solver of the differential equation. We then allow the AI training machinery to optimize the RNN weights to fit the data better. We illustrate the method on an example of a time series of 10h-FMC from RAWS and weather data from the Real-Time Mesoscale Analysis (RTMA). ",

Despite their efficiency, these methods suffer from the suboptimal representative capacity, since they forgo the correlation established by connecting multiple first-order similarities, i.e., the relation among the indirect instances, which could be defined as the high-order similarity. To tackle this drawback, we propose to model both the first- and the high-order similarities in the Hamming space through the user-item bipartite graph. Therefore, we develop a novel learning to hash framework, namely Hamming Spatial Graph Convolutional Networks (HS-GCN), which explicitly models the Hamming similarity and embeds it into the codes of users and items.

These data-driven solutions are enabled by large software vulnerability datasets used for training and benchmarking. However, we observe that the quality of the data powering these solutions is currently ill-considered, hindering the reliability and value of produced outcomes. Whilst awareness of software vulnerability data preparation challenges is growing, there has been little investigation into the potential negative impacts of software vulnerability data quality. For instance, we lack confirmation that vulnerability labels are correct or consistent. Our study seeks to address such shortcomings by inspecting five inherent data quality attributes for four state-of-the-art software vulnerability datasets and the subsequent impacts that issues can have on software vulnerability prediction models. Surprisingly, we found that all the analyzed datasets exhibit some data quality problems. In particular, we found 20-71% of vulnerability labels to be inaccurate in real-world datasets, and 17-99% of data points were duplicated. We observed that these issues could cause significant impacts on downstream models, either preventing effective model training or inflating benchmark performance. We advocate for the need to overcome such challenges. Our findings will enable better consideration and assessment of software vulnerability data quality in the future. ",

Due to the cost and potential harm, acquiring large medical datasets necessary for deep learning can be difficult. Medical image synthesis could help mitigate this problem. However, until now, the availability of GANs capable of synthesizing longitudinal volumetric data has been limited. To address this, we use the recent advances in latent space-based image editing to propose a novel joint learning scheme to explicitly embed temporal dependencies in the latent space of GANs. This, in contrast to previous methods, allows us to synthesize continuous, smooth, and high-quality longitudinal volumetric data with limited supervision. We show the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets containing different longitudinal dependencies. Namely, modeling a simple image transformation, breathing motion, and tumor regression, all while showing minimal disentanglement.

Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate both the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms. In particular, the fast one scales to large networks with more than two million nodes, and achieves up to $20\\times$ speed-up over the state-of-the-art algorithm. ",

We point out, however, that as the diversity is typically measured by certain pre-selected item attributes, e.g., category as the most popularly employed one, improved diversity can be achieved without sacrificing recommendation accuracy, as long as the diversification respects the user's preference about the pre-selected attributes. This calls for a fine-grained understanding of a user's preferences over items, where one needs to recognize the user's choice is driven by the quality of the item itself, or the pre-selected attributes of the item. In this work, we focus on diversity defined on item categories. We propose a general diversification framework agnostic to the choice of recommendation algorithms. Our solution disentangles the learnt user representation in the recommendation module into category-independent and category-dependent components to differentiate a user's preference over items from two orthogonal perspectives. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets and online A/B test demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution in improving both recommendation accuracy and diversity. In-depth analysis suggests that the improvement is due to our improved modeling of users' categorical preferences and refined ranking within item categories. ",

However, current studies of wireless FL typically consider a single task in a single-cell wireless network, ignoring the impact of inter-cell interference on learning performance. In this paper, we investigate a simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted over-the-air computation based vertical FL system in multi-cell networks, in which a STAR-RIS is deployed at the cell edge to facilitate the completion of different FL tasks in different cells. We establish the convergence of the proposed system through theoretical analysis and introduce the Pareto boundary of the optimality gaps to characterize the trade-off among cells. Based on the analysis, we then jointly design the transmit and receive beamforming as well as the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficient matrices to minimize the sum of the gaps of all cells. To solve the non-convex resource allocation problem, we introduce a successive convex approximation based algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that compared with conventional approaches, the proposed STAR-RIS assisted vertical FL model and the cooperative resource allocation algorithm achieve much lower mean-squared error for both uplink and downlink transmission in multi-cell wireless networks, resulting in improved learning performance for vertical FL.

It is thus essential that distributed controllers are robust toward these uncertainties and able to react quickly to disturbances of any kind. To this end, we present novel methods for model-based identification of attacks and combine them with distributed model predictive control to obtain a resilient framework for adaptively robust control. The methodology is specially designed for distributed setups with limited local information due to privacy and security reasons.

However, the visible pixels of the occluded objects are limited, making the rectangle instance feature mixed with a lot of instance-irrelevant noise information. Besides, by counting the number of instances with different degrees of overlap of CrowdHuman dataset, we find that the number of severely overlapping objects and the number of slightly overlapping objects are unbalanced, which may exacerbate the challenges posed by occlusion issues. Regarding to the noise issue, from the perspective of denoising, an iterable dynamic instance noise filter (DINF) is proposed for the RCNN-based pedestrian detectors to improve the signal-noise ratio of the instance feature. Simulating the wavelet denoising process, we use the instance feature vector to generate dynamic convolutional kernels to transform the RoIs features to a domain in which the near-zero values represent the noise information. Then, soft thresholding with channel-wise adaptive thresholds is applied to convert the near-zero values to zero to filter out noise information. For the imbalance issue, we propose an IoU-Focal factor (IFF) to modulate the contributions of the well-regressed boxes and the bad-regressed boxes to the loss in the training process, paying more attention to the minority severely overlapping objects. Extensive experiments conducted on CrowdHuman and CityPersons demonstrate that our methods can help RCNN-based pedestrian detectors achieve state-of-the-art performance. ",

    "abstract": "Objective: The n2c2/UW SDOH Challenge explores the extraction of social determinant of health (SDOH) information from clinical notes. The objectives include the advancement of natural language processing (NLP) information extraction techniques for SDOH and clinical information more broadly. This paper presents the shared task, data, participating teams, performance results, and considerations for future work. Materials and Methods: The task used the Social History Annotated Corpus (SHAC), which consists of clinical text with detailed event-based annotations for SDOH events such as alcohol, drug, tobacco, employment, and living situation. Each SDOH event is characterized through attributes related to status, extent, and temporality. The task includes three subtasks related to information extraction (Subtask A), generalizability (Subtask B), and learning transfer (Subtask C). In addressing this task, participants utilized a range of techniques, including rules, knowledge bases, n-grams, word embeddings, and pretrained language models (LM). Results: A total of 15 teams participated, and the top teams utilized pretrained deep learning LM. The top team across all subtasks used a sequence-to-sequence approach achieving 0.901 F1 for Subtask A, 0.774 F1 Subtask B, and 0.889 F1 for Subtask C. Conclusions: Similar to many NLP tasks and domains, pretrained LM yielded the best performance, including generalizability and learning transfer. An error analysis indicates extraction performance varies by SDOH, with lower performance achieved for conditions, like substance use and homelessness, that increase health risks (risk factors) and higher performance achieved for conditions, like substance abstinence and living with family, that reduce health risks (protective factors).

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study network reliability in relation to a periodic time-dependent utility function that reflects the system's functional performance. When an anomaly occurs, the system incurs a loss of utility that depends on the anomaly's timing and duration. We analyze the long-term average utility loss by considering exponential anomalies' inter-arrival times and general distributions of maintenance duration. We show that the expected utility loss converges in probability to a simple form. We then extend our convergence results to more general distributions of anomalies' inter-arrival times and to particular families of non-periodic utility functions. To validate our results, we use data gathered from a cellular network consisting of 660 base stations and serving over 20k users. We demonstrate the quasi-periodic nature of users' traffic and the exponential distribution of the anomalies' inter-arrival times, allowing us to apply our results and provide reliability scores for the network. We also discuss the convergence speed of the long-term average utility loss, the interplay between the different network's parameters, and the impact of non-stationarity on our convergence results.

    "abstract": "Using knowledge graph embedding models (KGEMs) is a popular approach for predicting links in knowledge graphs (KGs). Traditionally, the performance of KGEMs for link prediction is assessed using rank-based metrics, which evaluate their ability to give high scores to ground-truth entities. However, the literature claims that the KGEM evaluation procedure would benefit from adding supplementary dimensions to assess. That is why, in this paper, we extend our previously introduced metric Sem@$K$ that measures the capability of models to predict valid entities w.r.t. domain and range constrains. In particular, we consider a broad range of KGs and take their respective characteristics into account to propose different versions of Sem@$K$. We also perform an extensive study of KGEM semantic awareness. Our experiments show that Sem@$K$ provides a new perspective on KGEM quality. Its joint analysis with rank-based metrics offer different conclusions on the predictive power of models. Regarding Sem@$K$, some KGEMs are inherently better than others, but this semantic superiority is not indicative of their performance w.r.t. rank-based metrics. In this work, we generalize conclusions about the relative performance of KGEMs w.r.t. rank-based and semantic-oriented metrics at the level of families of models. The joint analysis of the aforementioned metrics gives more insight into the peculiarities of each model. This work paves the way for a more comprehensive evaluation of KGEM adequacy for specific downstream tasks. ",

Our proposed SLAM system is consist of visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and LiDAR inertial odometry (LIO) subsystems. We propose the LIO subsystem utilizing the measurement from the LiDAR and the inertial sensors to build the local odometry map, and propose the VIO subsystem which takes in the visual information to construct the 2D-3D associated map. Then, we propose an iterative Kalman Filter-based optimization function to optimize the local project-based 2D-to-3D photo-metric error between the projected image pixels and the local 3D points to make the robust 2D-3D alignment. Finally, we have also proposed the back-end pose graph global optimization and the elaborately designed loop closure detection network to improve the accuracy of the whole SLAM system. Extensive experiments deployed on the UGV in complicated real-world circumstances demonstrate that our proposed LiDAR-Visual-Inertial localization system outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.

    "abstract": "Model order reduction usually consists of two stages: the offline stage and the online stage. The offline stage is the expensive part that sometimes takes hours till the final reduced-order model is derived, especially when the original model is very large or complex. Once the reduced-order model is obtained, the online stage of querying the reduced-order model for simulation is very fast and often real-time capable. This work concerns a strategy to significantly speed up the offline stage of model order reduction for large and complex systems. In particular, it is successful in accelerating the greedy algorithm that is often used in the offline stage for reduced-order model construction. We propose multi-fidelity error estimators and replace the high-fidelity error estimator in the greedy algorithm. Consequently, the computational complexity at each iteration of the greedy algorithm is reduced and the algorithm converges more than 3 times faster without incurring noticeable accuracy loss. ",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, an explosion in the availability of education-related datasets has enabled new computational research in education. Much of this work has investigated digital traces of online learners in order to better understand and optimize their cognitive learning processes. Yet cognitive learning on digital platforms does not equal education. Instead, education is an inherently social, cultural, economic, and political process manifesting in physical spaces, and educational outcomes are influenced by many factors that precede and shape the cognitive learning process. Many of these are social factors like children's connections to schools (including teachers, counselors, and role models), parents and families, and the broader neighborhoods in which they live. In this article, we briefly discuss recent studies of learning through large-scale digital platforms, but largely focus on those exploring sociological aspects of education. We believe computational social scientists can creatively advance this emerging research frontier-and in doing so, help facilitate more equitable educational and life outcomes. ",

    "abstract": "Very large state spaces with a sparse reward signal are difficult to explore. The lack of a sophisticated guidance results in a poor performance for numerous reinforcement learning algorithms. In these cases, the commonly used random exploration is often not helpful. The literature shows that this kind of environments require enormous efforts to systematically explore large chunks of the state space. Learned state representations can help here to improve the search by providing semantic context and build a structure on top of the raw observations. In this work we introduce a novel time-myopic state representation that clusters temporal close states together while providing a time prediction capability between them. By adapting this model to the Go-Explore paradigm (Ecoffet et al., 2021b), we demonstrate the first learned state representation that reliably estimates novelty instead of using the hand-crafted representation heuristic. Our method shows an improved solution for the detachment problem which still remains an issue at the Go-Explore Exploration Phase. We provide evidence that our proposed method covers the entire state space with respect to all possible time trajectories without causing disadvantageous conflict-overlaps in the cell archive. Analogous to native Go-Explore, our approach is evaluated on the hard exploration environments MontezumaRevenge, Gravitar and Frostbite (Atari) in order to validate its capabilities on difficult tasks. Our experiments show that time-myopic Go-Explore is an effective alternative for the domain-engineered heuristic while also being more general. The source code of the method is available on GitHub.

As an intermediate step, we find out sharp phase transition thresholds for the extreme eigenvalues of spiked random matrices, which generalize the Baik-Ben Arous-P\\'{e}ch\\'{e} (BBP) transition. We also prove the central limit theorem for the linear spectral statistics for the spiked random matrices and propose a hypothesis test based on it, which does not depend on the distribution of the signal or the noise. When the noise is non-Gaussian noise, the test can be improved with an entrywise transformation to the data matrix with additive noise.

While even a single-hidden layer NN is a universal approximator, its expressive power is limited by the use of simple neuron activation functions (such as sigmoid functions) that are typically the same for all neurons. More flexible neuron activation functions would allow using fewer neurons and layers and thereby save computational cost and improve expressive power. We show that additive Gaussian process regression (GPR) can be used to construct optimal neuron activation functions that are individual to each neuron. An approach is also introduced that avoids non-linear fitting of neural network parameters. The resulting method combines the advantage of robustness of a linear regression with the higher expressive power of a NN. We demonstrate the approach by fitting the potential energy surface of the water molecule. Without requiring any non-linear optimization, the additive GPR based approach outperforms a conventional NN in the high accuracy regime, where a conventional NN suffers more from overfitting. ",

    "abstract": "Steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) based brain-computer interface (BCI) has received considerable attention due to its high transfer rate and available quantity of targets. However, the performance of frequency identification methods heavily hinges on the amount of user calibration data and data length, which hinders the deployment in real-world applications. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs)-based data generation methods have been widely adopted to create supplementary synthetic electroencephalography (EEG) data, holds promise to address these issues. In this paper, we proposed a GAN-based end-to-end signal transformation network for data length window extension, termed as TEGAN. TEGAN transforms short-time SSVEP signals into long-time artificial SSVEP signals. By incorporating a novel U-Net generator architecture and auxiliary classifier into the network design, the TEGAN could produce conditioned features in the synthetic data. Additionally, to regularize the training process of GAN, we introduced a two-stage training strategy and the LeCam-divergence regularization term during the network implementation. The proposed TEGAN was evaluated on two public SSVEP datasets. With the assistance of TEGAN, the performance of traditional frequency recognition methods and deep learning-based methods have been significantly improved under limited calibration data. This study substantiates the feasibility of the proposed method to extend the data length for short-time SSVEP signals to develop a high-performance BCI system. The proposed GAN-based methods have the great potential of shortening the calibration time for various real-world BCI-based applications, while the novelty of our augmentation strategies shed some value light on understanding the subject-invariant properties of SSVEPs.

While the application varies greatly, these devices are regularly used for performing board management tasks, making them a fundamental element in the correct operation of the board. The large number of hundreds of SoC devices creates significant challenges in their firmware deployment, maintenance, and accessibility. Even though U-Boot on ZUS+ devices supports network boot through the Preboot Execution Environment (PXE), the standard ZUS+ boot process contains application-specific information at earlier boot steps, particularly within the First Stage Bootloader (FSBL). This prevents the initialization of several devices from a universal image. Inspired by the PXE boot process on desktop PCs, this paper describes split boot, a novel boot method tailored to the specific needs of the ZUS+. All application-specific configuration is moved to a network storage device and automatically fetched during the boot process. We considered the entire process, from firmware and software development to binary distribution in a large-scale system. The developed method nicely integrates with the standard Xilinx development toolset workflow. ",
