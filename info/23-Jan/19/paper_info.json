    "title": "Mortality Prediction with Adaptive Feature Importance Recalibration for  Peritoneal Dialysis Patients: a deep-learning-based study on a real-world  longitudinal follow-up dataset",
    "abstract": "Objective: Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) is one of the most widely used life-supporting therapies for patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Predicting mortality risk and identifying modifiable risk factors based on the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) collected along with the follow-up visits are of great importance for personalized medicine and early intervention. Here, our objective is to develop a deep learning model for a real-time, individualized, and interpretable mortality prediction model - AICare. Method and Materials: Our proposed model consists of a multi-channel feature extraction module and an adaptive feature importance recalibration module. AICare explicitly identifies the key features that strongly indicate the outcome prediction for each patient to build the health status embedding individually. This study has collected 13,091 clinical follow-up visits and demographic data of 656 PD patients. To verify the application universality, this study has also collected 4,789 visits of 1,363 hemodialysis dialysis (HD) as an additional experiment dataset to test the prediction performance, which will be discussed in the Appendix. Results: 1) Experiment results show that AICare achieves 81.6%/74.3% AUROC and 47.2%/32.5% AUPRC for the 1-year mortality prediction task on PD/HD dataset respectively, which outperforms the state-of-the-art comparative deep learning models. 2) This study first provides a comprehensive elucidation of the relationship between the causes of mortality in patients with PD and clinical features based on an end-to-end deep learning model. 3) This study first reveals the pattern of variation in the importance of each feature in the mortality prediction based on built-in interpretability. 4) We develop a practical AI-Doctor interaction system to visualize the trajectory of patients' health status and risk indicators.

    "title": "Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Cooperative multi-robot tasks can benefit from heterogeneity in the robots' physical and behavioral traits. In spite of this, traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks lack the ability to explicitly accommodate policy heterogeneity, and typically constrain agents to share neural network parameters. This enforced homogeneity limits application in cases where the tasks benefit from heterogeneous behaviors. In this paper, we crystallize the role of heterogeneity in MARL policies. Towards this end, we introduce Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network Proximal Policy Optimization (HetGPPO), a paradigm for training heterogeneous MARL policies that leverages a Graph Neural Network for differentiable inter-agent communication. HetGPPO allows communicating agents to learn heterogeneous behaviors while enabling fully decentralized training in partially observable environments. We complement this with a taxonomical overview that exposes more heterogeneity classes than previously identified. To motivate the need for our model, we present a characterization of techniques that homogeneous models can leverage to emulate heterogeneous behavior, and show how this \"apparent heterogeneity\" is brittle in real-world conditions. Through simulations and real-world experiments, we show that: (i) when homogeneous methods fail due to strong heterogeneous requirements, HetGPPO succeeds, and, (ii) when homogeneous methods are able to learn apparently heterogeneous behaviors, HetGPPO achieves higher resilience to both training and deployment noise.

    "title": "The Feasibility of Algorithmic Detection and Decentralised Moderation  for Protecting Women from Online Abuse",
    "abstract": "Online abuse is becoming an increasingly prevalent issue in modern-day society, with 41 percent of Americans having experienced online harassment in some capacity in 2021. People who identify as women, in particular, can be subjected to a wide range of abusive behavior online, with gender-specific experiences cited broadly in recent literature across fields such as blogging, politics, and journalism. In response to this rise in abusive content, platforms have been found to largely employ \"individualistic moderation\" approaches, aiming to protect users from harmful content through the screening and management of singular interactions or accounts. Yet, previous work performed by the author of this paper has shown that in the cases of women in particular, these approaches can often be ineffective; failing to protect users from multi-dimensional abuse spanning prolonged time periods, different platforms, and varying interaction types. In recognition of its increasing complexity, platforms are beginning to outsource content moderation to users in a new and decentralized approach. The goal of this research is to examine the feasibility of using multidimensional abuse indicators in a Twitter-based moderation algorithm aiming to protect women from female-targeted online abuse. This research outlines three indicators of multidimensional abuse, explores how these indicators can be extracted as features from Twitter data, and proposes a technical framework for deploying an end-to-end moderation algorithm using these features.

    "abstract": "While the way intermediate representations are generated in encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence models typically allow them to preserve the semantics of the input sentence, input features such as formality might be left out. On the other hand, downstream tasks such as translation would benefit from working with a sentence representation that preserves formality in addition to semantics, so as to generate sentences with the appropriate level of social formality -- the difference between speaking to a friend versus speaking with a supervisor. We propose a sequence-to-sequence method for learning a formality-aware representation for Japanese sentences, where sentence generation is conditioned on both the original representation of the input sentence, and a side constraint which guides the sentence representation towards preserving formality information. Additionally, we propose augmenting the sentence representation with a learned representation of formality which facilitates the extraction of formality in downstream tasks. We address the lack of formality-annotated parallel data by adapting previous works on procedural formality classification of Japanese sentences. Experimental results suggest that our techniques not only helps the decoder recover the formality of the input sentence, but also slightly improves the preservation of input sentence semantics. ",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the information processing with binary spikes in the brain, the spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibit significant low energy consumption and are more suitable for incorporating multi-scale biological characteristics. Spiking Neurons, as the basic information processing unit of SNNs, are often simplified in most SNNs which only consider LIF point neuron and do not take into account the multi-compartmental structural properties of biological neurons. This limits the computational and learning capabilities of SNNs. In this paper, we proposed a brain-inspired SNN-based deep distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with combination of bio-inspired multi-compartment neuron (MCN) model and population coding method. The proposed multi-compartment neuron built the structure and function of apical dendritic, basal dendritic, and somatic computing compartments to achieve the computational power close to that of biological neurons. Besides, we present an implicit fractional embedding method based on spiking neuron population encoding. We tested our model on Atari games, and the experiment results show that the performance of our model surpasses the vanilla ANN-based FQF model and ANN-SNN conversion method based Spiking-FQF models. The ablation experiments show that the proposed multi-compartment neural model and quantile fraction implicit population spike representation play an important role in realizing SNN-based deep distributional reinforcement learning.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of technology, the automated monitoring systems of large-scale factories are becoming more and more important. By collecting a large amount of machine sensor data, we can have many ways to find anomalies. We believe that the real core value of an automated monitoring system is to identify and track the cause of the problem. The most famous method for finding causal anomalies is RCA, but there are many problems that cannot be ignored. They used the AutoRegressive eXogenous (ARX) model to create a time-invariant correlation network as a machine profile, and then use this profile to track the causal anomalies by means of a method called fault propagation. There are two major problems in describing the behavior of a machine by using the correlation network established by ARX: (1) It does not take into account the diversity of states (2) It does not separately consider the correlations with different time-lag. Based on these problems, we propose a framework called Ranking Causal Anomalies in End-to-End System (RCAE2E), which completely solves the problems mentioned above. In the experimental part, we use synthetic data and real-world large-scale photoelectric factory data to verify the correctness and existence of our method hypothesis. ",

While many studies have been paying attention to the political campaigns related to partisanship, politicians also can conduct different campaigns according to their chances of winning. Leading candidates, for example, do not behave the same as fringe candidates in their elections, and vice versa. We, however, know little about this difference in social media political campaign strategies according to their odds in elections. We tackle this problem by analyzing candidates' tweets in terms of users, topics, and sentiment of replies. Our study finds that, as their chances of winning increase, candidates narrow the targets they communicate with, from people in general to the electrical districts and specific persons (verified accounts or accounts with many followers). Our study brings new insights into the candidates' campaign strategies through the analysis based on the novel perspective of the candidate's electoral situation. ",

    "abstract": "Reducing the quantity of annotations required for supervised training is vital when labels are scarce and costly. This reduction is particularly important for semantic segmentation tasks involving 3D datasets, which are often significantly smaller and more challenging to annotate than their image-based counterparts. Self-supervised pre-training on unlabelled data is one way to reduce the amount of manual annotations needed. Previous work has focused on pre-training with point clouds exclusively. While useful, this approach often requires two or more registered views. In the present work, we combine image and point cloud modalities by first learning self-supervised image features and then using these features to train a 3D model. By incorporating image data, which is often included in many 3D datasets, our pre-training method only requires a single scan of a scene and can be applied to cases where localization information is unavailable. We demonstrate that our pre-training approach, despite using single scans, achieves comparable performance to other multi-scan, point cloud-only methods. ",

    "abstract": "As a crucial building block in vertical Federated Learning (vFL), Split Learning (SL) has demonstrated its practice in the two-party model training collaboration, where one party holds the features of data samples and another party holds the corresponding labels. Such method is claimed to be private considering the shared information is only the embedding vectors and gradients instead of private raw data and labels. However, some recent works have shown that the private labels could be leaked by the gradients. These existing attack only works under the classification setting where the private labels are discrete. In this work, we step further to study the leakage in the scenario of the regression model, where the private labels are continuous numbers (instead of discrete labels in classification). This makes previous attacks harder to infer the continuous labels due to the unbounded output range. To address the limitation, we propose a novel learning-based attack that integrates gradient information and extra learning regularization objectives in aspects of model training properties, which can infer the labels under regression settings effectively. The comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed attack. We hope our work can pave the way for future analyses that make the vFL framework more secure. ",

While the technology has a potential for facilitating tasks carried out in language documentation projects, such as speech transcription, pretraining a multilingual model from scratch for every new language would be highly impractical. We investigate the possibility for adapting an existing multilingual wav2vec 2.0 model for a new language, focusing on actual fieldwork data from a critically endangered tongue: Ainu. Specifically, we (i) examine the feasibility of leveraging data from similar languages also in fine-tuning; (ii) verify whether the model's performance can be improved by further pretraining on target language data. Our results show that continued pretraining is the most effective method to adapt a wav2vec 2.0 model for a new language and leads to considerable reduction in error rates. Furthermore, we find that if a model pretrained on a related speech variety or an unrelated language with similar phonological characteristics is available, multilingual fine-tuning using additional data from that language can have positive impact on speech recognition performance when there is very little labeled data in the target language.

In this paper, we investigate the relaxation properties of k-plex and propose an effective upper bound called Relaxed Graph color Bound (RGB) for the MkP. To describe and calculate RGB, we propose a new quasi-independent set structure that focuses on the number of conflict vertices. We combine RGB with two of the state-of-the-art branch and bound MkP algorithms, Maplex and KpLeX.

    "abstract": "In autonomous driving, 3D object detection based on multi-modal data has become an indispensable approach when facing complex environments around the vehicle. During multi-modal detection, LiDAR and camera are simultaneously applied for capturing and modeling. However, due to the intrinsic discrepancies between the LiDAR point and camera image, the fusion of the data for object detection encounters a series of problems. Most multi-modal detection methods perform even worse than LiDAR-only methods. In this investigation, we propose a method named PTA-Det to improve the performance of multi-modal detection. Accompanied by PTA-Det, a Pseudo Point Cloud Generation Network is proposed, which can convert image information including texture and semantic features by pseudo points. Thereafter, through a transformer-based Point Fusion Transition (PFT) module, the features of LiDAR points and pseudo points from image can be deeply fused under a unified point-based representation. The combination of these modules can conquer the major obstacle in feature fusion across modalities and realizes a complementary and discriminative representation for proposal generation. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset show the PTA-Det achieves a competitive result and support its effectiveness. ",

    "abstract": "Robust loss minimization is an important strategy for handling robust learning issue on noisy labels. Current robust losses, however, inevitably involve hyperparameters to be tuned for different datasets with noisy labels, manually or heuristically through cross validation, which makes them fairly hard to be generally applied in practice. Existing robust loss methods usually assume that all training samples share common hyperparameters, which are independent of instances. This limits the ability of these methods on distinguishing individual noise properties of different samples, making them hardly adapt to different noise structures. To address above issues, we propose to assemble robust loss with instance-dependent hyperparameters to improve their noise-tolerance with theoretical guarantee. To achieve setting such instance-dependent hyperparameters for robust loss, we propose a meta-learning method capable of adaptively learning a hyperparameter prediction function, called Noise-Aware-Robust-Loss-Adjuster (NARL-Adjuster). Specifically, through mutual amelioration between hyperparameter prediction function and classifier parameters in our method, both of them can be simultaneously finely ameliorated and coordinated to attain solutions with good generalization capability. Four kinds of SOTA robust losses are attempted to be integrated with our algorithm, and experiments substantiate the general availability and effectiveness of the proposed method in both its noise tolerance and generalization performance. Meanwhile, the explicit parameterized structure makes the meta-learned prediction function capable of being readily transferrable and plug-and-play to unseen datasets with noisy labels. Specifically, we transfer our meta-learned NARL-Adjuster to unseen tasks, including several real noisy datasets, and achieve better performance compared with conventional hyperparameter tuning strategy.

    "abstract": "In modern networking research, infrastructure-assisted unmanned autonomous vehicles (UAVs) are actively considered for real-time learning-based surveillance and aerial data-delivery under unexpected 3D free mobility and coordination. In this system model, it is essential to consider the power limitation in UAVs and autonomous object recognition (for abnormal behavior detection) deep learning model performance in infrastructure/towers. To overcome the power limitation of UAVs, this paper proposes a novel aerial scheduling algorithm between multi-UAVs and multi-towers where the towers conduct wireless power transfer toward UAVs. In addition, to take care of the high-performance learning model training in towers, the training data from UAVs should be fairly delivered to towers because larger data delivery will make huge computation overhead whereas the less data delivery will introduce overfitting. Therefore, fair data distribution from UAVs to their associated towers is essentially required. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel workload-aware scheduling algorithm between multi-towers and multi-UAVs for joint power-charging from towers to their associated UAVs and training data delivery from UAVs to their associated towers. For computing the workload-aware optimal scheduling decisions in each unit time, our solution approach for the given scheduling problem is designed based on Markov decision process (MDP) to deal with (i) time-varying low-complexity computation and (ii) pseudo-polynomial optimality. As shown in performance evaluation results, our proposed algorithm ensures (i) sufficient times for resource exchanges between towers and UAVs, (ii) the most even and uniform data collection during the processes compared to the other algorithms, and (iii) the performance of all towers converges to optimal levels.

    "abstract": "Current deep learning models often suffer from catastrophic forgetting of old knowledge when continually learning new knowledge. Existing strategies to alleviate this issue often fix the trade-off between keeping old knowledge (stability) and learning new knowledge (plasticity). However, the stability-plasticity trade-off during continual learning may need to be dynamically changed for better model performance. In this paper, we propose two novel ways to adaptively balance model stability and plasticity. The first one is to adaptively integrate multiple levels of old knowledge and transfer it to each block level in the new model. The second one uses prediction uncertainty of old knowledge to naturally tune the importance of learning new knowledge during model training. To our best knowledge, this is the first time to connect model prediction uncertainty and knowledge distillation for continual learning. In addition, this paper applies a modified CutMix particularly to augment the data for old knowledge, further alleviating the catastrophic forgetting issue. Extensive evaluations on the CIFAR100 and the ImageNet datasets confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method for continual learning. ",

The above multi-access network is referred to as combinatorial topology which is considered in this work with three additional features : a) Linear Function Retrieval (LFR) i.e., each user is interested in retrieving an arbitrary linear combination of files in the server's library; b) Security i.e., the content of the library must be kept secure from an eavesdropper who obtains the signal sent by the server; c) Privacy i.e., each user can only get its required file and can not get any information about the demands of other users. Achievable Secure, Private LFR (SP-LFR) scheme, Secure LFR (S-LFR) scheme and Improved S-LFR scheme are proposed. As special cases, our work recovers some of the results by Yan and Tuninetti (\"Key Superposition Simultaneously Achieves Security and Privacy in Cache-Aided Linear Function Retrieval,\" in \\textit{Trans. Inf. Forensics and Security}, 2021\") and Sengupta et al.(\"Fundamental limits of caching with secure delivery,\" in \\textit{Trans. Inf. Forensics and Security}, 2015). At a memory point, $M=\\frac{r\\binom{C}{r}}{C}$, the SP-LFR scheme is within a constant multiplicative factor from the optimal rate for $N\\geq2Kr$ and at, $M=\\frac{\\binom{C}{r}}{C}$, the improved S-LFR scheme is within a constant multiplicative factor from the optimal rate for $N\\geq2K$.

    "abstract": "Person Re-identification (ReID) has been extensively studied in recent years due to the increasing demand in public security. However, collecting and dealing with sensitive personal data raises privacy concerns. Therefore, federated learning has been explored for Person ReID, which aims to share minimal sensitive data between different parties (clients). However, existing federated learning based person ReID methods generally rely on laborious and time-consuming data annotations and it is difficult to guarantee cross-domain consistency. Thus, in this work, a federated unsupervised cluster-contrastive (FedUCC) learning method is proposed for Person ReID. FedUCC introduces a three-stage modelling strategy following a coarse-to-fine manner. In detail, generic knowledge, specialized knowledge and patch knowledge are discovered using a deep neural network. This enables the sharing of mutual knowledge among clients while retaining local domain-specific knowledge based on the kinds of network layers and their parameters. Comprehensive experiments on 8 public benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method. ",

Vision transformer-based autoencoder (ViT-AE) by He et al. (2021) is a recent self-supervised learning technique that employs a patch-masking strategy to learn a meaningful latent space. In this paper, we focus on improving ViT-AE (nicknamed ViT-AE++) for a more effective representation of both 2D and 3D medical images. We propose two new loss functions to enhance the representation during the training stage. The first loss term aims to improve self-reconstruction by considering the structured dependencies and hence indirectly improving the representation. The second loss term leverages contrastive loss to directly optimize the representation from two randomly masked views. As an independent contribution, we extended ViT-AE++ to a 3D fashion for volumetric medical images. We extensively evaluate ViT-AE++ on both natural images and medical images, demonstrating consistent improvement over vanilla ViT-AE and its superiority over other contrastive learning approaches. ",

    "abstract": "RGB-D saliency detection aims to fuse multi-modal cues to accurately localize salient regions. Existing works often adopt attention modules for feature modeling, with few methods explicitly leveraging fine-grained details to merge with semantic cues. Thus, despite the auxiliary depth information, it is still challenging for existing models to distinguish objects with similar appearances but at distinct camera distances. In this paper, from a new perspective, we propose a novel Hierarchical Depth Awareness network (HiDAnet) for RGB-D saliency detection. Our motivation comes from the observation that the multi-granularity properties of geometric priors correlate well with the neural network hierarchies. To realize multi-modal and multi-level fusion, we first use a granularity-based attention scheme to strengthen the discriminatory power of RGB and depth features separately. Then we introduce a unified cross dual-attention module for multi-modal and multi-level fusion in a coarse-to-fine manner. The encoded multi-modal features are gradually aggregated into a shared decoder. Further, we exploit a multi-scale loss to take full advantage of the hierarchical information. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that our HiDAnet performs favorably over the state-of-the-art methods by large margins. ",

These failures are especially problematic when they are silent, i.e., not accompanied by any explicit failure notification, hindering the timely detection and recovery. In this work, we propose an approach to run-time failure detection tailored for monitoring multi-tenant and concurrent cloud computing systems. The approach uses a non-intrusive form of event tracing, without manual changes to the system's internals to propagate session identifiers (IDs), and builds a set of lightweight monitoring rules from fault-free executions. We evaluated the effectiveness of the approach in detecting failures in the context of the OpenStack cloud computing platform, a complex and \"off-the-shelf\" distributed system, by executing a campaign of fault injection experiments in a multi-tenant scenario. Our experiments show that the approach detects the failure with an F1 score (0.85) and accuracy (0.77) higher than the ones provided by the OpenStack failure logging mechanisms (0.53 and 0.50) and two non--session-aware run-time verification approaches (both lower than 0.15). Moreover, the approach significantly decreases the average time to detect failures at run-time (~114 seconds) compared to the OpenStack logging mechanisms. ",

To date, many algorithms have been suggested that are generally based on path trajectory or reinforcement learning approaches. Although these methods have been efficient, they are not able to accurately imitate a smooth path traveled by an expert driver. In this paper, a method is presented to mimic drivers' behavior using a convolutional neural network (CNN). First, seven features are extracted from a dataset gathered from four expert drivers in a driving simulator. Then, these features are converted from 1D arrays to 2D arrays and injected into a CNN. The CNN model computes the desired steering wheel angle and sends it to an adaptive PD controller. Finally, the control unit applies proper torque to the steering wheel. Results show that the CNN model can mimic the drivers' behavior with an R2-squared of 0.83. Also, the performance of the presented method was evaluated in the driving simulator for 17 trials, which avoided all traffic cones successfully. In some trials, the presented method performed a smoother maneuver compared to the expert drivers. ",

In all such contexts, it is crucial to generate plausible data samples. A common assumption of approaches widely used for data generation is the independence of the features. However, typically, the variables of a dataset depend on one another, and these dependencies are not considered in data generation leading to the creation of implausible records. The main problem is that dependencies among variables are typically unknown. In this paper, we design a synthetic dataset generator for tabular data that can discover nonlinear causalities among the variables and use them at generation time. State-of-the-art methods for nonlinear causal discovery are typically inefficient. We boost them by restricting the causal discovery among the features appearing in the frequent patterns efficiently retrieved by a pattern mining algorithm. We design a framework for generating synthetic datasets with known causalities to validate our proposal. Broad experimentation on many synthetic and real datasets with known causalities shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

Our approach is compared to a CNN-based segmentation (for various CNN backbones) on two public datasets, one for face segmentation from 2D RGB images (FASSEG), and the other for brain segmentation from 3D MRIs (IBSR). Evaluations are performed using two types of structural information (distances and directional relations, , this choice being a hyper-parameter of our generic framework). On FASSEG data, results show that our module improves accuracy of the CNN by about 6.3% (the Hausdorff distance decreases from 22.11 to 20.71). On IBSR data, the improvement is of 51% (the Hausdorff distance decreases from 11.01 to 5.4). In addition, our approach is shown to be resilient to small training datasets that often limit the performance of deep learning methods: the improvement increases as the size of the training dataset decreases.

Latent structure models are a powerful tool for learning to extract such representations, offering a way to incorporate structural bias, discover insight about the data, and interpret decisions. However, effective training is challenging, as neural networks are typically designed for continuous computation. This text explores three broad strategies for learning with discrete latent structure: continuous relaxation, surrogate gradients, and probabilistic estimation. Our presentation relies on consistent notations for a wide range of models. As such, we reveal many new connections between latent structure learning strategies, showing how most consist of the same small set of fundamental building blocks, but use them differently, leading to substantially different applicability and properties.

    "abstract": "A key performance bottleneck when training graph neural network (GNN) models on large, real-world graphs is loading node features onto a GPU. Due to limited GPU memory, expensive data movement is necessary to facilitate the storage of these features on alternative devices with slower access (e.g. CPU memory). Moreover, the irregularity of graph structures contributes to poor data locality which further exacerbates the problem. Consequently, existing frameworks capable of efficiently training large GNN models usually incur a significant accuracy degradation because of the inevitable shortcuts involved. To address these limitations, we instead propose ReFresh, a general-purpose GNN mini-batch training framework that leverages a historical cache for storing and reusing GNN node embeddings instead of re-computing them through fetching raw features at every iteration. Critical to its success, the corresponding cache policy is designed, using a combination of gradient-based and staleness criteria, to selectively screen those embeddings which are relatively stable and can be cached, from those that need to be re-computed to reduce estimation errors and subsequent downstream accuracy loss. When paired with complementary system enhancements to support this selective historical cache, ReFresh is able to accelerate the training speed on large graph datasets such as ogbn-papers100M and MAG240M by 4.6x up to 23.6x and reduce the memory access by 64.5% (85.7% higher than a raw feature cache), with less than 1% influence on test accuracy.

As a side result of our investigation, we gain a deeper insight into the structure of the latent space of diffusion models, opening interesting perspectives on its exploration, the definition of semantic trajectories, and the manipulation/conditioning of encodings for editing purposes. A particularly interesting property highlighted by our research, which is also characteristic of this class of generative models, is the independence of the latent representation from the networks implementing the reverse diffusion process.

Therefore, recent innovations in computer architecture advocate compute-in-memory (CIM) and compute-near-memory (CNM), non-von- Neumann paradigms achieving orders-of-magnitude improvements in performance and energy consumption. Despite significant technological breakthroughs in the last few years, the programmability of these systems is still a serious challenge. Their programming models are too low-level and specific to particular system implementations. Since such future architectures are predicted to be highly heterogenous, developing novel compiler abstractions and frameworks become necessary. To this end, we present CINM (Cinnamon), a first end-to-end compilation flow that leverages the hierarchal abstractions to generalize over different CIM and CNM devices and enable device-agnostic and device-aware optimizations. Cinnamon progressively lowers input programs and performs optimizations at each level in the lowering pipeline. To show its efficacy, we evaluate CINM on a set of benchmarks for the well-known UPMEM CNM system and the memristors-based CIM accelerators. We show that Cinnamon, supporting multiple hardware targets, generates high-performance code comparable to or better than state-of-the-art implementations. ",

In our paper, we show that these high sensitivity directions do not lie only along particular worst-case directions, but rather are more abundant in the deep neural policy landscape and can be found via more natural means in a black-box setting. Furthermore, we show that vanilla training techniques intriguingly result in learning more robust policies compared to the policies learnt via the state-of-the-art adversarial training techniques.

Thus, most empirical studies can only report statistical correlations -- instead of potentially more insightful and robust causal relations. This paper discusses some novel techniques that support analyzing purely observational data for causal relations. Using fundamental causal models such as directed acyclic graphs, one can rigorously express, and partially validate, causal hypotheses; and then use the causal information to guide the construction of a statistical model that captures genuine causal relations -- such that correlation does imply causation. We apply these ideas to analyzing public data about programmer performance in Code Jam, a large world-wide coding contest organized by Google every year. Specifically, we look at the impact of different programming languages on a participant's performance in the contest. While the overall effect associated with programming languages is weak compared to other variables -- regardless of whether we consider correlational or causal links -- we found considerable differences between a purely statistical and a causal analysis of the very same data. The takeaway message is that even an imperfect causal analysis of observational data can help answer the salient research questions more precisely and more robustly than with just purely statistical techniques.

To overcome this challenge, the research community has focused on multimodal machine learning frameworks that can efficiently reason through multiple data sources. Despite recent advances in multimodal learning, these frameworks still suffer from (i) challenges of joint-training caused by the different characteristics of different modalities and (ii) overfitting tendencies due to high model complexity. In this work, we address these challenges by introducing a multimodal reasoning framework, AutoFraudNet (Automobile Insurance Fraud Detection Network), for detecting fraudulent auto-insurance claims. AutoFraudNet utilizes a cascaded slow fusion framework and state-of-the-art fusion block, BLOCK Tucker, to alleviate the challenges of joint-training. Furthermore, it incorporates a light-weight architectural design along with additional losses to prevent overfitting. Through extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset, we demonstrate: (i) the merits of multimodal approaches, when compared to unimodal and bimodal methods, and (ii) the effectiveness of AutoFraudNet in fusing various modalities to boost performance (over 3\\% in PR AUC).

    "abstract": "This paper aims to enhance the computational efficiency of safety verification of neural network control systems by developing a guaranteed neural network model reduction method. First, a concept of model reduction precision is proposed to describe the guaranteed distance between the outputs of a neural network and its reduced-size version. A reachability-based algorithm is proposed to accurately compute the model reduction precision. Then, by substituting a reduced-size neural network controller into the closed-loop system, an algorithm to compute the reachable set of the original system is developed, which is able to support much more computationally efficient safety verification processes. Finally, the developed methods are applied to a case study of the Adaptive Cruise Control system with a neural network controller, which is shown to significantly reduce the computational time of safety verification and thus validate the effectiveness of the method.

However, conventional skin disease recognition systems may produce high confidence for out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which may become a major security vulnerability in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale detection framework to detect out-of-distribution skin disease image data to ensure the robustness of the system. Our framework extracts features from different layers of the neural network. In the early layers, rectified activation is used to make the output features closer to the well-behaved distribution, and then an one-class SVM is trained to detect OOD data; in the penultimate layer, an adapted Gram matrix is used to calculate the features after rectified activation, and finally the layer with the best performance is chosen to compute a normality score. Experiments show that the proposed framework achieves superior performance when compared with other state-of-the-art methods in the task of skin disease recognition. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in vision-language pre-training (e.g. CLIP) have shown that vision models can benefit from language supervision. While many models using language modality have achieved great success on 2D vision tasks, the joint representation learning of 3D point cloud with text remains under-explored due to the difficulty of 3D-Text data pair acquisition and the irregularity of 3D data structure. In this paper, we propose a novel Text4Point framework to construct language-guided 3D point cloud models. The key idea is utilizing 2D images as a bridge to connect the point cloud and the language modalities. The proposed Text4Point follows the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. During the pre-training stage, we establish the correspondence of images and point clouds based on the readily available RGB-D data and use contrastive learning to align the image and point cloud representations. Together with the well-aligned image and text features achieved by CLIP, the point cloud features are implicitly aligned with the text embeddings. Further, we propose a Text Querying Module to integrate language information into 3D representation learning by querying text embeddings with point cloud features. For fine-tuning, the model learns task-specific 3D representations under informative language guidance from the label set without 2D images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model shows consistent improvement on various downstream tasks, such as point cloud semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection.

ChatGPT is able to respond effectively to a wide range of human questions, providing fluent and comprehensive answers that significantly surpass previous public chatbots in terms of security and usefulness. On one hand, people are curious about how ChatGPT is able to achieve such strength and how far it is from human experts. On the other hand, people are starting to worry about the potential negative impacts that large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT could have on society, such as fake news, plagiarism, and social security issues. In this work, we collected tens of thousands of comparison responses from both human experts and ChatGPT, with questions ranging from open-domain, financial, medical, legal, and psychological areas. We call the collected dataset the Human ChatGPT Comparison Corpus (HC3). Based on the HC3 dataset, we study the characteristics of ChatGPT's responses, the differences and gaps from human experts, and future directions for LLMs. We conducted comprehensive human evaluations and linguistic analyses of ChatGPT-generated content compared with that of humans, where many interesting results are revealed. After that, we conduct extensive experiments on how to effectively detect whether a certain text is generated by ChatGPT or humans. We build three different detection systems, explore several key factors that influence their effectiveness, and evaluate them in different scenarios.

However, current counts of mitotic nuclei rely on pathologists looking microscopically at the number of mitotic nuclei in hot spots, which is subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a two-stage cascaded network, named FoCasNet, for mitosis detection. In the first stage, a detection network named M_det is proposed to detect as many mitoses as possible. In the second stage, a classification network M_class is proposed to refine the results of the first stage. In addition, the attention mechanism, normalization method, and hybrid anchor branch classification subnet are introduced to improve the overall detection performance. Our method achieves the current highest F1-score of 0.888 on the public dataset ICPR 2012.

HTSS involves simultaneous training on multiple heterogeneous datasets, i.e. datasets with conflicting label spaces and different (weak) annotation types from the perspective of semantic segmentation. The HTSS formulation exposes deep networks to a larger and previously unexplored aggregation of information that can potentially enhance semantic segmentation in three directions: i) performance: increased segmentation metrics on seen datasets, ii) generalization: improved segmentation metrics on unseen datasets, and iii) knowledgeability: increased number of recognizable semantic concepts. To research these benefits of HTSS, we propose a unified framework, that incorporates heterogeneous datasets in a single-network training pipeline following the established FCN standard. Our framework first curates heterogeneous datasets to bring them into a common format and then trains a single-backbone FCN on all of them simultaneously. To achieve this, it transforms weak annotations, which are incompatible with semantic segmentation, to per-pixel labels, and hierarchizes their label spaces into a universal taxonomy. The trained HTSS models demonstrate performance and generalization gains over a wide range of datasets and extend the inference label space entailing hundreds of semantic classes. ",

The fact that these data have a graph structure and the greater capability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn from these structures has led to their successful incorporation into recommender systems. However, the bias amplification issue needs to be investigated while using these algorithms. Bias results in unfair decisions, which can negatively affect the company reputation and financial status due to societal disappointment and environmental harm. In this paper, we aim to comprehensively study this problem through a literature review and an analysis of the behavior against biases of different GNN-based algorithms compared to state-of-the-art methods.

    "abstract": "In audio processing applications, the generation of expressive sounds based on high-level representations demonstrates a high demand. These representations can be used to manipulate the timbre and influence the synthesis of creative instrumental notes. Modern algorithms, such as neural networks, have inspired the development of expressive synthesizers based on musical instrument timbre compression. Unsupervised deep learning methods can achieve audio compression by training the network to learn a mapping from waveforms or spectrograms to low-dimensional representations. This study investigates the use of stacked convolutional autoencoders for the compression of time-frequency audio representations for a variety of instruments for a single pitch. Further exploration of hyper-parameters and regularization techniques is demonstrated to enhance the performance of the initial design. In an unsupervised manner, the network is able to reconstruct a monophonic and harmonic sound based on latent representations. In addition, we introduce an evaluation metric to measure the similarity between the original and reconstructed samples. Evaluating a deep generative model for the synthesis of sound is a challenging task. Our approach is based on the accuracy of the generated frequencies as it presents a significant metric for the perception of harmonic sounds. This work is expected to accelerate future experiments on audio compression using neural autoencoders. ",

The key innovation of the current paper is the decoupling of the features representing the relationships from those of the objects, which enables the detection of novel object-relationship combinations.

A quantitative prediction objective can be enriched by qualitative data interpretation, for instance by locating the most influential features.

Sparse partial least squares combine both strategies, by blending variable selection into PLS. The variant presented in this paper, Dual-sPLS, generalizes the classical PLS1 algorithm. It provides balance between accurate prediction and efficient interpretation. It is based on penalizations inspired by classical regression methods (lasso, group lasso, least squares, ridge) and uses the dual norm notion.

Due to the large amount of astronomical catalogues generated by the ongoing and next-generation large-scale sky surveys, the time complexity of the cross-matching is increasing dramatically. Heterogeneous computing environments provide a theoretical possibility to accelerate the cross-matching, but the performance advantages of heterogeneous computing resources have not been fully utilized. To meet the challenge of cross-matching for substantial increasing amount of astronomical observation data, this paper proposes Heterogeneous-computing-enabled Large Catalogue Cross-matcher (HLC2), a high-performance cross-matching framework based on spherical position deviation on CPU-GPU heterogeneous computing platforms. It supports scalable and flexible cross-matching and can be directly applied to the fusion of large astronomical cataloguesfrom survey missions and astronomical data centres. A performance estimation model is proposed to locate the performance bottlenecks and guide the optimizations. A two-level partitioning strategy is designed to generate an optimized data placement according to the positions of celestial objects to increase throughput. To make HLC2 a more adaptive solution, the architecture-aware task splitting, thread parallelization, and concurrent scheduling strategies are designed and integrated. Moreover, a novel quad-direction strategy is proposed for the boundary problem to effectively balance performance and completeness. We have experimentally evaluated HLC2 using public released catalogue data. Experiments demonstrate that HLC2 scales well on different sizes of catalogues and the cross-matching speed is significantly improved compared to the state-of-the-art cross-matchers. ",

To overcome these challenges, we present a unique curvilinear structure segmentation framework based on oriented derivative of stick (ODoS) filter and deep learning network for curvilinear object segmentation in medical images. Currently, a large number of deep learning models emphasis on developing deep architectures and ignore capturing the structural features of curvature objects, which may lead to unsatisfactory results. In consequence, a new approach that incorporates the ODoS filter as part of a deep learning network is presented to improve the spatial attention of curvilinear objects. In which, the original image is considered as principal part to describe various image appearance and complex background illumination, the multi-step strategy is used to enhance contrast between curvilinear objects and their surrounding backgrounds, and the vector field is applied to discriminate thin and uneven curvilinear structures. Subsequently, a deep learning framework is employed to extract varvious structural features for curvilinear object segmentation in medical images. The performance of the computational model was validated in experiments with publicly available DRIVE, STARE and CHASEDB1 datasets. Experimental results indicate that the presented model has yielded surprising results compared with some state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "title": "Beating the Best: Improving on AlphaFold2 at Protein Structure  Prediction",
    "abstract": "The goal of Protein Structure Prediction (PSP) problem is to predict a protein's 3D structure (confirmation) from its amino acid sequence. The problem has been a 'holy grail' of science since the Noble prize-winning work of Anfinsen demonstrated that protein conformation was determined by sequence. A recent and important step towards this goal was the development of AlphaFold2, currently the best PSP method. AlphaFold2 is probably the highest profile application of AI to science. Both AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold (another impressive PSP method) have been published and placed in the public domain (code & models). Stacking is a form of ensemble machine learning ML in which multiple baseline models are first learnt, then a meta-model is learnt using the outputs of the baseline level model to form a model that outperforms the base models. Stacking has been successful in many applications. We developed the ARStack PSP method by stacking AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold. ARStack significantly outperforms AlphaFold2. We rigorously demonstrate this using two sets of non-homologous proteins, and a test set of protein structures published after that of AlphaFold2 and RoseTTAFold. As more high quality prediction methods are published it is likely that ensemble methods will increasingly outperform any single method. ",
