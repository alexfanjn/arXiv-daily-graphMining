    "title": "Network Message Field Type Classification and Recognition for Unknown  Binary Protocols",
    "abstract": "Reverse engineering of unknown network protocols based on recorded traffic traces enables security analyses and debugging of undocumented network services. In particular for binary protocols, existing approaches (1) lack comprehensive methods to classify or determine the data type of a discovered segment in a message, e.,g., a number, timestamp, or network address, that would allow for a semantic interpretation and (2) have strong assumptions that prevent analysis of lower-layer protocols often found in IoT or mobile systems. In this paper, we propose the first generic method for analyzing unknown messages from binary protocols to reveal the data types in message fields. To this end, we split messages into segments of bytes and use their vector interpretation to calculate similarities. These can be used to create clusters of segments with the same type and, moreover, to recognize specific data types based on the clusters' characteristics. Our extensive evaluation shows that our method provides precise classification in most cases and a data-type-recognition precision of up to 100% at reasonable recall, improving the state-of-the-art by a factor between 1.3 and 3.7 in realistic scenarios. We open-source our implementation to facilitate follow-up works. ",

    "abstract": "Reverse engineering of undocumented protocols is a common task in security analyses of networked services. The communication itself, captured in traffic traces, contains much of the necessary information to perform such a protocol reverse engineering. The comprehension of the format of unknown messages is of particular interest for binary protocols that are not human-readable. One major challenge is to discover probable fields in a message as the basis for further analyses. Given a set of messages, split into segments of bytes by an existing segmenter, we propose a method to refine the approximation of the field inference. We use principle component analysis (PCA) to discover linearly correlated variance between sets of message segments. We relocate the boundaries of the initial coarse segmentation to more accurately match with the true fields. We perform different evaluations of our method to show its benefit for the message format inference and subsequent analysis tasks from literature that depend on the message format. We can achieve a median improvement of the message format accuracy across different real-world protocols by up to 100 %. ",

However, if the privacy of machine learning applications' customers cannot be guaranteed, it will cause security threats and losses to users' personal privacy information and service providers. Therefore, the issue of privacy protection of machine learning has received wide attention. For centralized machine learning models, we evaluate the impact of different neural network layers, gradient, gradient norm, and fine-tuned models on member inference attack performance with prior knowledge; For the federated learning model, we discuss the location of the attacker in the target model and its attack mode. The results show that the centralized machine learning model shows more serious member information leakage in all aspects, and the accuracy of the attacker in the central parameter server is significantly higher than the local Inference attacks as participants.

Among other things, we observe an empirical distinction between networks showing traditional core-periphery structure with a dense core weakly connected to a sparse periphery, and an alternative structure in which the core is strongly connected both within itself and to the periphery. Networks vary in whether they are better represented by one type of structure or the other. We also observe structures that are a hybrid between core-periphery structure and community structure, in which networks have a set of non-overlapping cores that correspond roughly to communities, surrounded by a single undifferentiated periphery.

    "abstract": "In autonomous driving, detection of abnormal driving behaviors is essential to ensure the safety of vehicle controllers. Prior works in vehicle anomaly detection have shown that modeling interactions between agents improves detection accuracy, but certain abnormal behaviors where structured road information is paramount are poorly identified, such as wrong-way and off-road driving. We propose a novel unsupervised framework for highway anomaly detection named Structural Attention-based Recurrent VAE (SABeR-VAE), which explicitly uses the structure of the environment to aid anomaly identification. Specifically, we use a vehicle self-attention module to learn the relations among vehicles on a road, and a separate lane-vehicle attention module to model the importance of permissible lanes to aid in trajectory prediction. Conditioned on the attention modules' outputs, a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture with a stochastic Koopman operator-propagated latent space predicts the next states of vehicles. Our model is trained end-to-end to minimize prediction loss on normal vehicle behaviors, and is deployed to detect anomalies in (ab)normal scenarios. By combining the heterogeneous vehicle and lane information, SABeR-VAE and its deterministic variant, SABeR-AE, improve abnormal AUPR by 18% and 25% respectively on the simulated MAAD highway dataset. Furthermore, we show that the learned Koopman operator in SABeR-VAE enforces interpretable structure in the variational latent space. The results of our method indeed show that modeling environmental factors is essential to detecting a diverse set of anomalies in deployment. ",

The stochastic evolutionary game model incorporates a small perturbation of customers' decision-making which exists due to irrationality. The solution of the stochastic evolutionary game in terms of stochastically stable states is characterized by using the Markov chain model.

Experiments are run on seven-time series models with three adversarial attacks and one adversarial defense. According to the findings, all models, particularly GRU and RNN, appear to be vulnerable.

Hardware mitigation is being studied extensively by the computer architecture community. It has the benefit of preserving software compatibility and the potential for much smaller performance overhead than software solutions. This paper presents a systematization of the hardware defenses against speculative execution attacks that have been proposed. We show that speculative execution attacks consist of 6 critical attack steps. We propose defense strategies, each of which prevents a critical attack step from happening, thus preventing the attack from succeeding. We then summarize 20 hardware defenses and overhead-reducing features that have been proposed. We show that each defense proposed can be classified under one of our defense strategies, which also explains why it can thwart the attack from succeeding. We discuss the scope of the defenses, their performance overhead, and the security-performance trade-offs that can be made. ",

    "abstract": "Empowered by deep neural networks (DNNs), Wi-Fi fingerprinting has recently achieved astonishing localization performance to facilitate many security-critical applications in wireless networks, but it is inevitably exposed to adversarial attacks, where subtle perturbations can mislead DNNs to wrong predictions. Such vulnerability provides new security breaches to malicious devices for hampering wireless network security, such as malfunctioning geofencing or asset management. The prior adversarial attack on localization DNNs uses additive perturbations on channel state information (CSI) measurements, which is impractical in Wi-Fi transmissions. To transcend this limitation, this paper presents FooLoc, which fools Wi-Fi CSI fingerprinting DNNs over the realistic wireless channel between the attacker and the victim access point (AP). We observe that though uplink CSIs are unknown to the attacker, the accessible downlink CSIs could be their reasonable substitutes at the same spot. We thoroughly investigate the multiplicative and repetitive properties of over-the-air perturbations and devise an efficient optimization problem to generate imperceptible yet robust adversarial perturbations. We implement FooLoc using commercial Wi-Fi APs and Wireless Open-Access Research Platform (WARP) v3 boards in offline and online experiments, respectively. The experimental results show that FooLoc achieves overall attack success rates of about 70% in targeted attacks and of above 90% in untargeted attacks with small perturbation-to-signal ratios of about -18dB.

As surrogates of physical-model-based OPF solvers, neural network (NN) solvers can accelerate the solving process. However, they may be unreliable for ``unseen\" inputs when the training dataset is unrepresentative. Enhancing the representativeness of the training dataset for NN solvers is indispensable but is not well studied in the literature. To tackle this challenge, we propose an OPF solver based on a physical-model-integrated NN with worth-learning data generation. The designed NN is a combination of a conventional multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and an OPF-model module, which outputs not only the optimal decision variables of the OPF problem but also the constraints violation degree. Based on this NN, the worth-learning data generation method can identify feasible samples that are not well generalized by the NN. By iteratively applying this method and including the newly identified worth-learning samples in the training set, the representativeness of the training set can be significantly enhanced. Therefore, the solution reliability of the NN solver can be remarkably improved. Experimental results show that the proposed method leads to an over 50% reduction of constraint violations and optimality loss compared to conventional NN solvers. ",

In this paper, we study a novel Temporal k-Core Query (TCQ) problem: given a time interval, find all distinct k-cores that exist within any subintervals from a temporal graph, which generalizes the previous historical k-core query. This problem is challenging because the number of subintervals increases quadratically to the span of time interval. For that, we propose a novel Temporal Core Decomposition (TCD) algorithm that decrementally induces temporal k-cores from the previously induced ones and thus reduces \"intra-core\" redundant computation significantly. Then, we introduce an intuitive concept named Tightest Time Interval (TTI) for temporal k-core, and design an optimization technique with theoretical guarantee that leverages TTI as a key to predict which subintervals will induce duplicated k-cores and prunes the subintervals completely in advance, thereby eliminating \"inter-core\" redundant computation. The complexity of optimized TCD (OTCD) algorithm no longer depends on the span of query time interval but only the scale of final results, which means OTCD algorithm is scalable. Moreover, we propose a compact in-memory data structure named Temporal Edge List (TEL) to implement OTCD algorithm efficiently in physical level with bounded memory requirement. TEL organizes temporal edges in a \"timeline\" and can be updated instantly when new edges arrive, and thus our approach can also deal with dynamic temporal graphs. We compare OTCD algorithm with the incremental historical k-core query on several real-world temporal graphs, and observe that OTCD algorithm outperforms it by three orders of magnitude, even though OTCD algorithm needs none precomputed index.

We, however, argue that the fall is essentially an accident, hence, its impact is uncontrollable and unforeseeable. We propose to solve the fall detection problem in a fundamentally different manner. Instead of directly identifying the human falls which are difficult to quantify, we recognize the normal repeatable human activities and then identify the fall as abnormal activities out of the normal activity distribution. We implement our idea and build a prototype based on commercial Wi-Fi. We conduct extensive experiments with 16 human subjects.

Existing methods model sessions as graphs or sequences to estimate user interests based on their interacted items to make recommendations. In recent years, graph-based methods have achieved outstanding performance on SBR. However, none of these methods consider temporal information, which is a crucial feature in SBR as it indicates timeliness or currency. Besides, the session graphs exhibit a hierarchical structure and are demonstrated to be suitable in hyperbolic geometry. But few papers design the models in hyperbolic spaces and this direction is still under exploration. In this paper, we propose Time-aware Hyperbolic Graph Attention Network (TA-HGAT) - a novel hyperbolic graph neural network framework to build a session-based recommendation model considering temporal information. More specifically, there are three components in TA-HGAT. First, a hyperbolic projection module transforms the item features into hyperbolic space. Second, the time-aware graph attention module models time intervals between items and the users' current interests. Third, an evolutionary loss at the end of the model provides an accurate prediction of the recommended item based on the given timestamp. TA-HGAT is built in a hyperbolic space to learn the hierarchical structure of session graphs. Experimental results show that the proposed TA-HGAT has the best performance compared to ten baseline models on two real-world datasets. ",

A coded computing scheme is proposed to achieve the Pareto-optimal tradeoff surface, in which the access point only needs to perform simple chain coding between the signals it receives, and information-theretical bound matching the surface is also provided.

    "abstract": "Software-defined networking (SDN) has been widely utilized to enforce the security of traditional networks, thereby promoting the process of transforming traditional networks into SDN networks. However, SDN-based security enforcement mechanisms rely heavily on the security policies containing the underlying information of data plane. With increasing the scale of underlying network, the current security policy management mechanism will confront more and more challenges. The security policy transformation for SDN networks is to research how to transform the high-level security policy without containing the underlying information of data plane into the practical flow entries used by the OpenFlow switches automatically, thereby implementing the automation of security policy management. Based on this insight, a practical runtime security policy transformation framework is proposed in this paper. First of all, we specify the security policies used by SDN networks as a system model of security policy (SPM). From the theoretical level, we establish the system model for SDN network and propose a formal method to transform SPM into the system model of flow entries automatically. From the practical level, we propose a runtime security policy transformation framework to solve the problem of how to find a connected path for each relationship of SPM in the data plane, as well as how to generate the practical flow entries according to the system model of flow entries. In order to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the framework, we set up an experimental system and implement the framework with POX controller and Mininet emulator. ",

During the last two decades, researchers' efforts are devoted to improving detection ability of IRSTDs. Despite the huge improvement in designing new algorithms, lack of extensive investigation of the evaluation metrics are evident. Therefore, in this paper, a systematic approach is utilized to: First, investigate the evaluation ability of current metrics; Second, propose new evaluation metrics to address shortcoming of common metrics. To this end, after carefully reviewing the problem, the required conditions to have a successful detection are analyzed. Then, the shortcomings of current evaluation metrics which include pre-thresholding as well as post-thresholding metrics are determined. Based on the requirements of real-world systems, new metrics are proposed. Finally, the proposed metrics are used to compare and evaluate four well-known small infrared target detection algorithms. The results show that new metrics are consistent with qualitative results. ",

    "abstract": "In last-mile delivery, drivers frequently deviate from planned delivery routes because of their tacit knowledge of the road and curbside infrastructure, customer availability, and other characteristics of the respective service areas. Hence, the actual stop sequences chosen by an experienced human driver may be potentially preferable to the theoretical shortest-distance routing under real-life operational conditions. Thus, being able to predict the actual stop sequence that a human driver would follow can help to improve route planning in last-mile delivery. This paper proposes a pair-wise attention-based pointer neural network for this prediction task using drivers' historical delivery trajectory data. In addition to the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture for sequence-to-sequence prediction, we propose a new attention mechanism based on an alternative specific neural network to capture the local pair-wise information for each pair of stops. To further capture the global efficiency of the route, we propose a new iterative sequence generation algorithm that is used after model training to identify the first stop of a route that yields the lowest operational cost. Results from an extensive case study on real operational data from Amazon's last-mile delivery operations in the US show that our proposed method can significantly outperform traditional optimization-based approaches and other machine learning methods (such as the Long Short-Term Memory encoder-decoder and the original pointer network) in finding stop sequences that are closer to high-quality routes executed by experienced drivers in the field. Compared to benchmark models, the proposed model can increase the average prediction accuracy of the first four stops from around 0.2 to 0.312, and reduce the disparity between the predicted route and the actual route by around 15%.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks do not discriminate between spurious and causal patterns, and will only learn the most predictive ones while ignoring the others. This shortcut learning behaviour is detrimental to a network's ability to generalize to an unknown test-time distribution in which the spurious correlations do not hold anymore. Debiasing methods were developed to make networks robust to such spurious biases but require to know in advance if a dataset is biased and make heavy use of minority counterexamples that do not display the majority bias of their class. In this paper, we argue that such samples should not be necessarily needed because the ''hidden'' causal information is often also contained in biased images. To study this idea, we propose 3 publicly released synthetic classification benchmarks, exhibiting predictive classification shortcuts, each of a different and challenging nature, without any minority samples acting as counterexamples. First, we investigate the effectiveness of several state-of-the-art strategies on our benchmarks and show that they do not yield satisfying results on them. Then, we propose an architecture able to succeed on our benchmarks, despite their unusual properties, using an entropic adversarial data augmentation training scheme. An encoder-decoder architecture is tasked to produce images that are not recognized by a classifier, by maximizing the conditional entropy of its outputs, and keep as much as possible of the initial content. A precise control of the information destroyed, via a disentangling process, enables us to remove the shortcut and leave everything else intact. Furthermore, results competitive with the state-of-the-art on the BAR dataset ensure the applicability of our method in real-life situations. ",

To fill the gap, we perform an empirical study by first interviewing 15 practitioners and then surveying 599 practitioners from 18 IT companies about their expectations on code completion. We then compare the practitioners' demands with current research via conducting a literature review of papers on code completion published in premier publication venues from 2012 to 2022.

    "abstract": "Fragile test execution is a common challenge for automated GUI-based testing of web applications as they evolve. Despite recent progress, there is still room for improvement since test execution failures caused by technical limitations result in unnecessary maintenance costs that limit its effectiveness and efficiency. One of the most reported technical challenges for web-based tests concerns how to reliably locate a web element used by a test script. This paper proposes the novel concept of Visually Overlapping Nodes (VON) that reduces fragility by utilizing the phenomenon that visual web elements (observed by the user) are constructed from multiple web-elements in the Document Object Model (DOM) that overlaps visually. We demonstrate the approach in a tool, VON Similo, which extends the state-of-the-art multi-locator approach (Similo) that is also used as the baseline for an experiment. In the experiment, a ground truth set of 1163 manually collected web element pairs, from different releases of the 40 most popular websites on the internet, are used to compare the approaches' precision, recall, and accuracy. Our results show that VON Similo provides 94.7% accuracy in identifying a web element in a new release of the same SUT. In comparison, Similo provides 83.8% accuracy. These results demonstrate the applicability of the visually overlapping nodes concept/tool for web element localization in evolving web applications and contribute a novel way of thinking about web element localization in future research on GUI-based testing.

The practical system parameters such as channel randomness and possible transmit power levels are taken into account for all individual signals of all involved users. The brute force (BF) and SIC signal detection methods are taken as benchmarks in the analysis. The QA-assisted ML decoder results in the same BER performance as the BF method outperforming the SIC technique, but the execution of QA takes more time than BF and SIC. The parallelization technique can be a potential aid to fasten the execution process. This will pave the way to fully realize the potential of QA decoders in NOMA systems. ",

The communication and computational resources on satellites are usually restricted and the satellite-GU link determination affects the communication performance significantly when multiple satellites provide services for multiple GUs in a collaborative manner. Therefore, considering the limitation of the on-board radio-frequency chains, we first propose a hybrid beamforming method consisting of analog beamforming for beam alignment and digital beamforming for interference mitigation. Then, to establish appropriate connections between satellites and GUs, we propose a heuristic user scheduling algorithm which determines the connections according to the total spectral efficiency (SE) increment of the multi-satellite cooperative network. Next, a joint hybrid beamforming and user scheduling scheme is proposed to dramatically improve the performance of the multi-satellite cooperative network. Moreover, simulations are conducted to compare the proposed schemes with representative baselines and analyze the key factors influencing the performance of the multi-satellite cooperative network. It is shown that the proposed joint beamforming and user scheduling approach can provide 47.2% SE improvement on average as compared with its non-joint counterpart. ",

For a large DN, the naive phase identification proposed in the majority of the prior works using a single voltage reference does not scale well for a multi-feeder DN. We present a consensus algorithm-based phase identification mechanism which uses multiple three-phase reference points to improve the prediction of phases. Due to the absence of real measurements for a real-suburban German DN, the algorithms are developed and evaluated over synthetic data using a digital twin. To utilize strongly correlated measurements, the DN is clustered into zones. We observe those reference measurements located in the same zone as the single-phase consumer leads to accurate prediction of DN phases. Four consensus algorithms are developed and compared. Using numerical results, we recommend the most robust phase identification mechanism. In our evaluation, measurement error, and the impact of the neutral conductor are also assessed. We assume limited DN observability and apply our findings to a German DN without smart meters, but only less than 8% of nodes have measurement boxes along with single-phase consumers with a home energy management system. Voltage time series for 1 month (hourly sampled) is utilized. The numerical results indicate that for 1% accuracy class measurement, the phase connectivity of 308 out of 313 single-phase consumers in a German DN can be identified. Further, we also propose metrics quantifying the goodness of the phase identification. The phase identification framework based on consensus algorithms for DN zones is scalable for large DN and robust towards measurement errors as the estimation is not dependent on a single measurement point.

These databases record the libraries related to each vulnerability. However, the vulnerability reports may not explicitly list every library and human analysis is required to determine all the relevant libraries. Human analysis may be slow and expensive, which motivates the need for automated approaches. Researchers and practitioners have proposed to automatically identify libraries from vulnerability reports using extreme multi-label learning (XML). While state-of-the-art XML techniques showed promising performance, their experiment settings do not practically fit what happens in reality. Previous studies randomly split the vulnerability reports data for training and testing their models without considering the chronological order of the reports. This may unduly train the models on chronologically newer reports while testing the models on chronologically older ones. However, in practice, one often receives chronologically new reports, which may be related to previously unseen libraries. Under this practical setting, we observe that the performance of current XML techniques declines substantially, e.g., F1 decreased from 0.7 to 0.24 under experiments without and with consideration of chronological order of vulnerability reports. We propose a practical library identification approach, namely CHRONOS, based on zero-shot learning. The novelty of CHRONOS is three-fold. First, CHRONOS fits into the practical pipeline by considering the chronological order of vulnerability reports. Second, CHRONOS enriches the data of the vulnerability descriptions and labels using a carefully designed data enhancement step.

    "abstract": "Training machines to understand natural language and interact with humans is one of the major goals of artificial intelligence. Recent years have witnessed an evolution from matching networks to pre-trained language models (PrLMs). In contrast to the plain-text modeling as the focus of the PrLMs, dialogue texts involve multiple speakers and reflect special characteristics such as topic transitions and structure dependencies between distant utterances. However, the related PrLM models commonly represent dialogues sequentially by processing the pairwise dialogue history as a whole. Thus the hierarchical information on either utterance interrelation or speaker roles coupled in such representations is not well addressed. In this work, we propose compositional learning for holistic interaction across the utterances beyond the sequential contextualization from PrLMs, in order to capture the utterance-aware and speaker-aware representations entailed in a dialogue history. We decouple the contextualized word representations by masking mechanisms in Transformer-based PrLM, making each word only focus on the words in current utterance, other utterances, and two speaker roles (i.e., utterances of sender and utterances of the receiver), respectively. In addition, we employ domain-adaptive training strategies to help the model adapt to the dialogue domains. Experimental results show that our method substantially boosts the strong PrLM baselines in four public benchmark datasets, achieving new state-of-the-art performance over previous methods. ",

Deep Learning based NLP especially Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT have found broad acceptance and are used extensively for many applications. A Language Model is a probability distribution over a word sequence. Self-supervised Learning on a large corpus of data automatically generates deep learning-based language models. BioBERT and Med-BERT are language models pre-trained for the healthcare domain. Healthcare uses typical NLP tasks such as question answering, information extraction, named entity recognition, and search to simplify and improve processes. However, to ensure robust application of the results, NLP practitioners need to normalize and standardize them. One of the main ways of achieving normalization and standardization is the use of Knowledge Graphs. A Knowledge Graph captures concepts and their relationships for a specific domain, but their creation is time-consuming and requires manual intervention from domain experts, which can prove expensive. SNOMED CT (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms), Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and Gene Ontology (GO) are popular ontologies from the healthcare domain. SNOMED CT and UMLS capture concepts such as disease, symptoms and diagnosis and GO is the world's largest source of information on the functions of genes. Healthcare has been dealing with an explosion in information about different types of drugs, diseases, and procedures. This paper argues that using Knowledge Graphs is not the best solution for solving problems in this domain. We present experiments using LLMs for the healthcare domain to demonstrate that language models provide the same functionality as knowledge graphs, thereby making knowledge graphs redundant. ",

    "abstract": "The developments of satellite communication in network systems require strong and effective security plans. Attacks such as denial of service (DoS) can be detected through the use of machine learning techniques, especially under normal operational conditions. This work aims to provide an interruption detection strategy for Low Earth Orbit (\\textsf{LEO}) satellite networks using deep learning algorithms. Both the training, and the testing of the proposed models are carried out with our own communication datasets, created by utilizing a satellite traffic (benign and malicious) that was generated using satellite networks simulation platforms, Omnet++ and Inet. We test different deep learning algorithms including Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Long Short-term Memory (LSTM). Followed by a full analysis and investigation of detection rate in both binary classification, and multi-classes classification that includes different interruption categories such as Distributed DoS (DDoS), Network Jamming, and meteorological disturbances. Simulation results for both classification types surpassed 99.33% in terms of detection rate in scenarios of full network surveillance. However, in more realistic scenarios, the best-recorded performance was 96.12% for the detection of binary traffic and 94.35% for the detection of multi-class traffic with a false positive rate of 3.72%, using a hybrid model that combines MLP and GRU. This Deep Learning approach efficiency calls for the necessity of using machine learning methods to improve security and to give more awareness to search for solutions that facilitate data collection in LEO satellite networks.

In this paper, we focus on knowledge-infused link prediction and question answering using language models, T5, and BLOOM across three domains: Aviation, Movie, and Web. In this context, we infuse knowledge in large and small language models and study their performance, and find the performance to be similar. For the link prediction task on the Aviation Knowledge Graph, we obtain a 0.2 hits@1 score using T5-small, T5-base, T5-large, and BLOOM. Using template-based scripts, we create a set of 1 million synthetic factoid QA pairs in the aviation domain from National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reports. On our curated QA pairs, the three models of T5 achieve a 0.7 hits@1 score. We validate out findings with the paired student t-test and Cohen's kappa scores. For link prediction on Aviation Knowledge Graph using T5-small and T5-large, we obtain a Cohen's kappa score of 0.76, showing substantial agreement between the models.

We discuss the fundamental concepts of both recommender systems and causal inference as well as their relationship, and review the existing work on causal methods for different problems in recommender systems.

    "abstract": "Human-Object Interaction (HOI), as an important problem in computer vision, requires locating the human-object pair and identifying the interactive relationships between them. The HOI instance has a greater span in spatial, scale, and task than the individual object instance, making its detection more susceptible to noisy backgrounds. To alleviate the disturbance of noisy backgrounds on HOI detection, it is necessary to consider the input image information to generate fine-grained anchors which are then leveraged to guide the detection of HOI instances. However, it is challenging for the following reasons. i) how to extract pivotal features from the images with complex background information is still an open question. ii) how to semantically align the extracted features and query embeddings is also a difficult issue. In this paper, a novel end-to-end transformer-based framework (FGAHOI) is proposed to alleviate the above problems. FGAHOI comprises three dedicated components namely, multi-scale sampling (MSS), hierarchical spatial-aware merging (HSAM) and task-aware merging mechanism (TAM). MSS extracts features of humans, objects and interaction areas from noisy backgrounds for HOI instances of various scales. HSAM and TAM semantically align and merge the extracted features and query embeddings in the hierarchical spatial and task perspectives in turn. In the meanwhile, a novel training strategy Stage-wise Training Strategy is designed to reduce the training pressure caused by overly complex tasks done by FGAHOI. In addition, we propose two ways to measure the difficulty of HOI detection and a novel dataset, i.e., HOI-SDC for the two challenges (Uneven Distributed Area in Human-Object Pairs and Long Distance Visual Modeling of Human-Object Pairs) of HOI instances detection.

In this work, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the robustness of NeRF-based novel view synthesis algorithms in the presence of different types of corruptions. We find that NeRF-based models are significantly degraded in the presence of corruption, and are more sensitive to a different set of corruptions than image recognition models. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of the feature encoder in generalizable methods, which synthesize images using neural features extracted via convolutional neural networks or transformers, and find that it only contributes marginally to robustness. Finally, we reveal that standard data augmentation techniques, which can significantly improve the robustness of recognition models, do not help the robustness of NeRF-based models. We hope that our findings will attract more researchers to study the robustness of NeRF-based approaches and help to improve their performance in the real world. ",

We then study community detection in graphs obeying the stochastic block model and censored block model with auxiliary latent variables. We analyze the conditions for exact recovery when these auxiliary latent variables are unknown, representing unknown nuisance parameters or model mismatch. We also analyze exact recovery when these secondary latent variables have been either fully or partially revealed.

    "abstract": "Protein folding neural networks (PFNNs) such as AlphaFold predict remarkably accurate structures of proteins compared to other approaches. However, the robustness of such networks has heretofore not been explored. This is particularly relevant given the broad social implications of such technologies and the fact that biologically small perturbations in the protein sequence do not generally lead to drastic changes in the protein structure. In this paper, we demonstrate that AlphaFold does not exhibit such robustness despite its high accuracy. This raises the challenge of detecting and quantifying the extent to which these predicted protein structures can be trusted. To measure the robustness of the predicted structures, we utilize (i) the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and (ii) the Global Distance Test (GDT) similarity measure between the predicted structure of the original sequence and the structure of its adversarially perturbed version. We prove that the problem of minimally perturbing protein sequences to fool protein folding neural networks is NP-complete. Based on the well-established BLOSUM62 sequence alignment scoring matrix, we generate adversarial protein sequences and show that the RMSD between the predicted protein structure and the structure of the original sequence are very large when the adversarial changes are bounded by (i) 20 units in the BLOSUM62 distance, and (ii) five residues (out of hundreds or thousands of residues) in the given protein sequence. In our experimental evaluation, we consider 111 COVID-19 proteins in the Universal Protein resource (UniProt), a central resource for protein data managed by the European Bioinformatics Institute, Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, and the US Protein Information Resource. These result in an overall GDT similarity test score average of around 34%, demonstrating a substantial drop in the performance of AlphaFold. ",

NRC learns to reconstruct scenes from novel views using a dictionary of object codes which are decoded through a volumetric renderer. This enables the discovery of reoccurring visual and geometric patterns across scenes which are transferable to downstream tasks. We show that NRC representations transfer well to object navigation in THOR, outperforming 2D and 3D representation learning methods by 3.1% success rate.

We investigate the suitability of gravity and radiation type models for reconstructing the exposure-networks based on geo-spatial and population mobility information. For this we use a mobile phone dataset of aggregated daily visits from a postal code area to cellphone grid locations, and treat it as a bipartite network to create weighted one mode projections using a weighted co-occurrence function. We fit a gravitation model and a radiation model to the averaged weekly and yearly projection networks with geo-spatial and socioeconomic variables of the postal code areas and their populations. We also consider an extended gravity type model comprising of additional postal area information such as distance via public transportation and population density. The results show that the co-occurrence of human activities, or exposure, between postal code areas follows both the gravity and radiation type interactions, once fitted to the empirical network. The effects of the pandemic beginning in 2020 can be observed as a decrease of the overall activity as well as of the exposure of the projected networks. In general, the results show that the postal code level networks changed to be more proximity weighted after the pandemic began, following the government imposed non-pharmaceutical interventions, with differences based on the geo-spatial and socioeconomic structure of the areas.

Abnormal breathing can be a sign of fatal health issues which may lead to further diagnosis and treatment. Wireless light wave sensing (LWS) using incoherent infrared light turns out to be promising in human breathing monitoring in a safe, discreet, efficient and non-invasive way without raising any privacy concerns. The regular breathing patterns of each individual are unique, hence the respiration monitoring system needs to learn the subject's usual pattern in order to raise flags for breathing anomalies. Additionally, the system needs to be capable of validating that the collected data is a breathing waveform, since any faulty data generated due to external interruption or system malfunction should be discarded. In order to serve both of these needs, breathing data of normal and abnormal breathing were collected using infrared light wave sensing technology in this study. Two machine learning algorithms, decision tree and random forest, were applied to detect breathing anomalies and faulty data. Finally, model performance was evaluated using average classification accuracies found through cross-validation. The highest classification accuracy of 96.6% was achieved with the data collected at 0.5m distance using decision tree model. Ensemble models like random forest were found to perform better than a single model in classifying the data that were collected at multiple distances from the light wave sensing setup. ",

The cutwidth of an ordering is the maximum cutwidth of any vertex with respect to this ordering. We are interested in finding the cutwidth of a graph, that is, the minimum cutwidth over all orderings, which is an NP-hard problem. In order to approximate the cutwidth of a given graph, we present a semidefinite relaxation. We identify several classes of valid inequalities and equalities that we use to strengthen the semidefinite relaxation. These classes are on the one hand the well-known 3-dicycle equations and the triangle inequalities and on the other hand we obtain inequalities from the squared linear ordering polytope and via lifting the linear ordering polytope. The solution of the semidefinite program serves to obtain a lower bound and also to construct a feasible solution and thereby having an upper bound on the cutwidth. In order to evaluate the quality of our bounds, we perform numerical experiments on graphs of different sizes and densities. It turns out that we produce high quality bounds for graphs of medium size independent of their density in reasonable time. Compared to that, obtaining bounds for dense instances of the same quality is out of reach for solvers using integer linear programming techniques. ",

One of these methods is the approximate Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) which have demonstrated to yield consistent posterior distribution into the parameter space, helpful for uncertainty quantification. However, as any modern neural networks, they tend to produce overly confident uncertainty estimates and can introduce bias when BNNs are applied to data. In this work, we implement multiplicative normalizing flows (MNFs), a family of approximate posteriors for the parameters of BNNs with the purpose of enhancing the flexibility of the variational posterior distribution, to extract $\\Omega_m$, $h$, and $\\sigma_8$ from the QUIJOTE simulations. We have compared this method with respect to the standard BNNs, and the flipout estimator. We found that MNFs combined with BNNs outperform the other models obtaining predictive performance with almost one order of magnitude larger that standard BNNs, $\\sigma_8$ extracted with high accuracy ($r^2=0.99$), and precise uncertainty estimates. The latter implies that MNFs provide more realistic predictive distribution closer to the true posterior mitigating the bias introduced by the variational approximation and allowing to work with well-calibrated networks.

    "title": "Quantum Multi-Agent Actor-Critic Neural Networks for Internet-Connected  Multi-Robot Coordination in Smart Factory Management",
    "abstract": "As one of the latest fields of interest in both academia and industry, quantum computing has garnered significant attention. Among various topics in quantum computing, variational quantum circuits (VQC) have been noticed for their ability to carry out quantum deep reinforcement learning (QRL). This paper verifies the potential of QRL, which will be further realized by implementing quantum multi-agent reinforcement learning (QMARL) from QRL, especially for Internet-connected autonomous multi-robot control and coordination in smart factory applications. However, the extension is not straightforward due to the non-stationarity of classical MARL. To cope with this, the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) QMARL framework is proposed under the Internet connection. A smart factory environment with the Internet of Things (IoT)-based multiple agents is used to show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. The simulation corroborates that the proposed QMARL-based autonomous multi-robot control and coordination performs better than the other frameworks. ",
