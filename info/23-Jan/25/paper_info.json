    "abstract": "Object recognition systems are usually trained and evaluated on high resolution images. However, in real world applications, it is common that the images have low resolutions or have small sizes. In this study, we first track the performance of the state-of-the-art deep object recognition network, Faster- RCNN, as a function of image resolution. The results reveals negative effects of low resolution images on recognition performance. They also show that different spatial frequencies convey different information about the objects in recognition process. It means multi-resolution recognition system can provides better insight into optimal selection of features that results in better recognition of objects. This is similar to the mechanisms of the human visual systems that are able to implement multi-scale representation of a visual scene simultaneously. Then, we propose a multi-resolution object recognition framework rather than a single-resolution network. The proposed framework is evaluated on the PASCAL VOC2007 database. The experimental results show the performance of our adapted multi-resolution Faster-RCNN framework outperforms the single-resolution Faster-RCNN on input images with various resolutions with an increase in the mean Average Precision (mAP) of 9.14% across all resolutions and 1.2% on the full-spectrum images. Furthermore, the proposed model yields robustness of the performance over a wide range of spatial frequencies. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the problem of decentralized multi-agent perimeter defense that asks for computing actions for defenders with local perceptions and communications to maximize the capture of intruders. One major challenge for practical implementations is to make perimeter defense strategies scalable for large-scale problem instances. To this end, we leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to develop an imitation learning framework that learns a mapping from defenders' local perceptions and their communication graph to their actions. The proposed GNN-based learning network is trained by imitating a centralized expert algorithm such that the learned actions are close to that generated by the expert algorithm. We demonstrate that our proposed network performs closer to the expert algorithm and is superior to other baseline algorithms by capturing more intruders. Our GNN-based network is trained at a small scale and can be generalized to large-scale cases. We run perimeter defense games in scenarios with different team sizes and configurations to demonstrate the performance of the learned network. ",

We then take insights obtained from this toy model and apply them to two physical data sets (one from particle physics and one from acoustics), which are known to be amenable to classification by DNN's. We show that the simplicity in their topological structure explains the majority of the DNN's ability to operate on these data sets by showing that fully interpretable topological classifiers are able to perform nearly as well as their DNN counterparts.

    "abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (I-IoT) is a collaboration of devices, sensors, and networking equipment to monitor and collect data from industrial operations. Machine learning (ML) methods use this data to make high-level decisions with minimal human intervention. Data-driven predictive maintenance (PDM) is a crucial ML-based I-IoT application to find an optimal maintenance schedule for industrial assets. The performance of these ML methods can seriously be threatened by adversarial attacks where an adversary crafts perturbed data and sends it to the ML model to deteriorate its prediction performance. The models should be able to stay robust against these attacks where robustness is measured by how much perturbation in input data affects model performance. Hence, there is a need for effective defense mechanisms that can protect these models against adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a double defense mechanism to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks in I-IoT environments. We first detect if there is an adversarial attack on a given sample using novelty detection algorithms. Then, based on the outcome of our algorithm, marking an instance as attack or normal, we select adversarial retraining or standard training to provide a secondary defense layer. If there is an attack, adversarial retraining provides a more robust model, while we apply standard training for regular samples. Since we may not know if an attack will take place, our adaptive mechanism allows us to consider irregular changes in data. The results show that our double defense strategy is highly efficient where we can improve model robustness by up to 64.6% and 52% compared to standard and adversarial retraining, respectively. ",

After the robot is deployed in a new domain, the representation can be updated intuitively and data-efficiently by non-experts, and the robot is able to fulfill sound commands without any hand-crafted reward functions. We demonstrate our approach on various sound types and robotic tasks, including navigation and manipulation with raw sensor inputs.

    "abstract": "In recent years, recycling and disposal of end-of-life (EOL) electronic products has attracted considerable attention in response to concerns over resource recovery and environmental impacts of electronic waste (e-waste). In many countries, legislation to make manufacturers responsible for taking e-waste at the end of their useful lives either has been adopted or is being considered. In this paper, by capturing different stages in the life-cycle of EOL electronic products (or, e-waste) generated from private or small-entity users, we develop two different formulations of a reverse logistics network, i.e. system-optimum model and user-optimum model, to estimate both economic and environmental effects of take-back legislation. In this system, e-waste is collected through user drop-off at designated collection sites. While we study the whole reverse logistics network associated with recycling and remanufacturing of e-waste in the system-optimum model and obtain an optimum solution from the policy maker's perspective, we split the logistics network into two distinct parts in the user-optimum model in order to derive an optimum solution from the users' standpoint. Implementing the proposed models on an illustrative example shows how they are capable of estimating the economic and environmental impacts of take-back legislation in various stages of e-waste's life-cycle.

    "abstract": "Data scarcity hinders the usability of data-dependent algorithms when tackling IoT intrusion detection (IID). To address this, we utilise the data rich network intrusion detection (NID) domain to facilitate more accurate intrusion detection for IID domains. In this paper, a Geometric Graph Alignment (GGA) approach is leveraged to mask the geometric heterogeneities between domains for better intrusion knowledge transfer. Specifically, each intrusion domain is formulated as a graph where vertices and edges represent intrusion categories and category-wise interrelationships, respectively. The overall shape is preserved via a confused discriminator incapable to identify adjacency matrices between different intrusion domain graphs. A rotation avoidance mechanism and a centre point matching mechanism is used to avoid graph misalignment due to rotation and symmetry, respectively. Besides, category-wise semantic knowledge is transferred to act as vertex-level alignment. To exploit the target data, a pseudo-label election mechanism that jointly considers network prediction, geometric property and neighbourhood information is used to produce fine-grained pseudo-label assignment. Upon aligning the intrusion graphs geometrically from different granularities, the transferred intrusion knowledge can boost IID performance. Comprehensive experiments on several intrusion datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of the GGA approach and validate the usefulness of GGA constituting components. ",

    "abstract": "We consider the allocation of $m$ balls (jobs) into $n$ bins (servers). In the standard Two-Choice process, at each step $t=1,2,\\ldots,m$ we first sample two bins uniformly at random and place a ball in the least loaded bin. It is well-known that for any $m \\geq n$, this results in a gap (difference between the maximum and average load) of $\\log_2 \\log n + \\Theta(1)$ (with high probability). In this work, we consider the Memory process [Mitzenmacher, Prabhakar and Shah 2002] where instead of two choices, we only sample one bin per step but we have access to a cache which can store the location of one bin. Mitzenmacher, Prabhakar and Shah showed that in the lightly loaded case ($m = n$), the Memory process achieves a gap of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log \\log n)$. Extending the setting of Mitzenmacher et al. in two ways, we first allow the number of balls $m$ to be arbitrary, which includes the challenging heavily loaded case where $m \\geq n$. Secondly, we follow the heterogeneous bins model of Wieder [Wieder 2007], where the sampling distribution of bins can be biased up to some arbitrary multiplicative constant. Somewhat surprisingly, we prove that even in this setting, the Memory process still achieves an $\\mathcal{O}(\\log \\log n)$ gap bound. This is in stark contrast with the Two-Choice (or any $d$-Choice with $d=\\mathcal{O}(1)$) process, where it is known that the gap diverges as $m \\rightarrow \\infty$ [Wieder 2007]. Further, we show that for any sampling distribution independent of $m$ (but possibly dependent on $n$) the Memory process has a gap that can be bounded independently of $m$. Finally, we prove a tight gap bound of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log n)$ for Memory in another relaxed setting with heterogeneous (weighted) balls and a cache which can only be maintained for two steps. ",

    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are becoming increasingly popular as they can process a wide variety of data formats that prior deep neural networks cannot easily support. One key challenge in designing hardware accelerators for GCNs is the vast size and randomness in their data access patterns which greatly reduces the effectiveness of the limited on-chip cache. Aimed at improving the effectiveness of the cache by mitigating the irregular data accesses, prior studies often employ the vertex tiling techniques used in traditional graph processing applications. While being effective at enhancing the cache efficiency, those approaches are often sensitive to the tiling configurations where the optimal setting heavily depends on target input datasets. Furthermore, the existing solutions require manual tuning through trial-and-error or rely on sub-optimal analytical models. In this paper, we propose Slice-and-Forge (SnF), an efficient hardware accelerator for GCNs which greatly improves the effectiveness of the limited on-chip cache. SnF chooses a tiling strategy named feature slicing that splits the features into vertical slices and processes them in the outermost loop of the execution. This particular choice results in a repetition of the identical computational patterns over irregular graph data over multiple rounds. Taking advantage of such repetitions, SnF dynamically tunes its tile size. Our experimental results reveal that SnF can achieve 1.73x higher performance in geomean compared to prior work on multi-engine settings, and 1.46x higher performance in geomean on small scale settings, without the need for off-line analyses.

When it comes to sequential decision-making tasks, however, it is difficult to properly design such a pretraining approach that can cope with both high-dimensional perceptual information and the complexity of sequential control over long interaction horizons. The challenge becomes combinatorially more complex if we want to pretrain representations amenable to a large variety of tasks. To tackle this problem, in this work, we formulate a general pretraining-finetuning pipeline for sequential decision making, under which we propose a generic pretraining framework \\textit{Self-supervised Multi-task pretrAining with contRol Transformer (SMART)}. By systematically investigating pretraining regimes, we carefully design a Control Transformer (CT) coupled with a novel control-centric pretraining objective in a self-supervised manner. SMART encourages the representation to capture the common essential information relevant to short-term control and long-term control, which is transferrable across tasks. We show by extensive experiments in DeepMind Control Suite that SMART significantly improves the learning efficiency among seen and unseen downstream tasks and domains under different learning scenarios including Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Benefiting from the proposed control-centric objective, SMART is resilient to distribution shift between pretraining and finetuning, and even works well with low-quality pretraining datasets that are randomly collected.

However, there are an infinite number of possible trajectories to consider. To simplify the space of trajectories under consideration, we utilise homotopy classes to partition the space into countably many mathematically equivalent classes. All members within a class demonstrate identical high-level motion with respect to the environment, i.e., travelling above or below an obstacle. This allows high-level prediction of a trajectory in terms of a sparse label identifying its homotopy class. We therefore present a light-weight learning framework based on variable-order Markov processes to learn and predict homotopy classes and thus high-level agent motion. By informing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with our homotopy class predictions, we see great improvements in low-level trajectory prediction compared to a naive GMM on a real dataset. ",

Although many studies have emerged to improve the universality of GNNs, they rarely consider the label reuse and the correlation of their proposed metrics and models. In this paper, we first design a new metric, named Neighborhood Homophily (\\textit{NH}), to measure the label complexity or purity in the neighborhood of nodes.

To make better use of the available data, ontologies have been proposed in the literature to organize their storage in a structured way. However, the full potential of these formal methods to capture our domain knowledge has yet to be demonstrated. In this work, we evaluate a performance prediction model built on top of the extension of the recently proposed OPTION ontology. More specifically, we first extend the OPTION ontology with the vocabulary needed to represent modular black-box optimization algorithms. Then, we use the extended OPTION ontology, to create knowledge graphs with fixed-budget performance data for two modular algorithm frameworks, modCMA, and modDE, for the 24 noiseless BBOB benchmark functions. We build the performance prediction model using a knowledge graph embedding-based methodology. Using a number of different evaluation scenarios, we show that a triple classification approach, a fairly standard predictive modeling task in the context of knowledge graphs, can correctly predict whether a given algorithm instance will be able to achieve a certain target precision for a given problem instance. This approach requires feature representation of algorithms and problems. While the latter is already well developed, we hope that our work will motivate the community to collaborate on appropriate algorithm representations. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial training suffers from the issue of robust overfitting, which seriously impairs its generalization performance. Data augmentation, which is effective at preventing overfitting in standard training, has been observed by many previous works to be ineffective in mitigating overfitting in adversarial training. This work proves that, contrary to previous findings, data augmentation alone can significantly boost accuracy and robustness in adversarial training. We find that the hardness and the diversity of data augmentation are important factors in combating robust overfitting. In general, diversity can improve both accuracy and robustness, while hardness can boost robustness at the cost of accuracy within a certain limit and degrade them both over that limit. To mitigate robust overfitting, we first propose a new crop transformation, Cropshift, which has improved diversity compared to the conventional one (Padcrop). We then propose a new data augmentation scheme, based on Cropshift, with much improved diversity and well-balanced hardness. Empirically, our augmentation method achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness for data augmentations in adversarial training. Furthermore, when combined with weight averaging it matches, or even exceeds, the performance of the best contemporary regularization methods for alleviating robust overfitting.

    "abstract": "Moving Target Defense (MTD) has emerged as a key technique in various security applications as it takes away the attacker's ability to perform reconnaissance for exploiting a system's vulnerabilities. However, most of the existing research in the field assumes unrealistic access to information about the attacker's motivations and/or actions when developing MTD strategies. Many of the existing approaches also assume complete knowledge regarding the vulnerabilities of a system and how each of these vulnerabilities can be exploited by an attacker. In this work, we aim to create algorithms that generate effective Moving Target Defense strategies that do not rely on prior knowledge about the attackers. Our work assumes that the only way the defender receives information about its own reward is via interaction with the attacker in a repeated game setting. Depending on the amount of information that can be obtained from the interactions, we devise two different algorithms using multi-armed bandit formulation to identify efficient strategies. We then evaluate our algorithms using data mined from the National Vulnerability Database to showcase that they match the performance of the state-of-the-art techniques, despite using a lot less amount of information.

Although there have been significant recent advances in neural conversational systems using large language models and growth in available dialog corpora, dialog tutoring has largely remained unaffected by these advances. In this paper, we rigorously analyze various generative language models on two dialog tutoring datasets for language learning using automatic and human evaluations to understand the new opportunities brought by these advances as well as the challenges we must overcome to build models that would be usable in real educational settings. We find that although current approaches can model tutoring in constrained learning scenarios when the number of concepts to be taught and possible teacher strategies are small, they perform poorly in less constrained scenarios. Our human quality evaluation shows that both models and ground-truth annotations exhibit low performance in terms of equitable tutoring, which measures learning opportunities for students and how engaging the dialog is. To understand the behavior of our models in a real tutoring setting, we conduct a user study using expert annotators and find a significantly large number of model reasoning errors in 45% of conversations. Finally, we connect our findings to outline future work. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new approach which uses the tools within Artificial Intelligence (AI) software libraries as an alternative way of solving partial differential equations (PDEs) that have been discretised using standard numerical methods. In particular, we describe how to represent numerical discretisations arising from the finite volume and finite element methods by pre-determining the weights of convolutional layers within a neural network. As the weights are defined by the discretisation scheme, no training of the network is required and the solutions obtained are identical (accounting for solver tolerances) to those obtained with standard codes often written in Fortran or C++. We also explain how to implement the Jacobi method and a multigrid solver using the functions available in AI libraries. For the latter, we use a U-Net architecture which is able to represent a sawtooth multigrid method. A benefit of using AI libraries in this way is that one can exploit their power and their built-in technologies. For example, their executions are already optimised for different computer architectures, whether it be CPUs, GPUs or new-generation AI processors. In this article, we apply the proposed approach to eigenvalue problems in reactor physics where neutron transport is described by diffusion theory. For a fuel assembly benchmark, we demonstrate that the solution obtained from our new approach is the same (accounting for solver tolerances) as that obtained from the same discretisation coded in a standard way using Fortran. We then proceed to solve a reactor core benchmark using the new approach. ",

This is achieved by taking account of student course marks and sensitive attributes provided by the education office. The skill sets of students are determined using unsupervised dimensionality reduction of course mark data via the Laplacian eigenmap. The problem is formulated as a constrained graph partitioning problem, whereby the diversity of skill sets in each group are maximised, group sizes are upper and lower bounded according to available resources, and `balance' of a sensitive attribute is lower bounded to enforce fairness in group formation. This optimisation problem is solved using integer programming and its effectiveness is demonstrated on a dataset of student course marks from Imperial College London. ",

    "abstract": "The lacking of analytic solutions of diverse partial differential equations (PDEs) gives birth to series of computational techniques for numerical solutions. In machine learning, numerous latest advances of solver designs are accomplished in developing neural operators, a kind of mesh-free approximators of the infinite-dimensional operators that map between different parameterization spaces of equation solutions. Although neural operators exhibit generalization capacities for learning an entire PDE family simultaneously, they become less accurate and explainable while learning long-term behaviours of non-linear PDE families. In this paper, we propose Koopman neural operator (KNO), a new neural operator, to overcome these challenges. With the same objective of learning an infinite-dimensional mapping between Banach spaces that serves as the solution operator of target PDE family, our approach differs from existing models by formulating a non-linear dynamic system of equation solution. By approximating the Koopman operator, an infinite-dimensional linear operator governing all possible observations of the dynamic system, to act on the flow mapping of dynamic system, we can equivalently learn the solution of an entire non-linear PDE family by solving simple linear prediction problems. In zero-shot prediction and long-term prediction experiments on representative PDEs (e.g., the Navier-Stokes equation), KNO exhibits notable advantages in breaking the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency (e.g., model size) while previous state-of-the-art models are limited. These results suggest that more efficient PDE solvers can be developed by the joint efforts from physics and machine learning. ",

We first identify two main challenges of learning such policies: 1) the indistinguishability of tasks from the state distribution, due to the vast scene diversity, and 2) the non-stationary nature of environment dynamics caused by partial observability. To tackle the first challenge, we propose Goal-Sensitive Backbone (GSB) for the policy to encourage the emergence of goal-relevant visual state representations. To tackle the second challenge, the policy is further fueled by an adaptive horizon prediction module that helps alleviate the learning uncertainty brought by the non-stationary dynamics. Experiments on 20 Minecraft tasks show that our method significantly outperforms the best baseline so far; in many of them, we double the performance. Our ablation and exploratory studies then explain how our approach beat the counterparts and also unveil the surprising bonus of zero-shot generalization to new scenes (biomes). We hope our agent could help shed some light on learning goal-conditioned, multi-task agents in challenging, open-ended environments like Minecraft. ",

    "abstract": "Personal data collected at scale from surveys or digital devices offers important insights for statistical analysis and scientific research. Safely sharing such data while protecting privacy is however challenging. Anonymization allows data to be shared while minimizing privacy risks, but traditional anonymization techniques have been repeatedly shown to provide limited protection against re-identification attacks in practice. Among modern anonymization techniques, synthetic data generation (SDG) has emerged as a potential solution to find a good tradeoff between privacy and statistical utility. Synthetic data is typically generated using algorithms that learn the statistical distribution of the original records, to then generate \"artificial\" records that are structurally and statistically similar to the original ones. Yet, the fact that synthetic records are \"artificial\" does not, per se, guarantee that privacy is protected. In this work, we systematically evaluate the tradeoffs between protecting privacy and preserving statistical utility for a wide range of synthetic data generation algorithms. Modeling privacy as protection against attribute inference attacks (AIAs), we extend and adapt linear reconstruction attacks, which have not been previously studied in the context of synthetic data. While prior work suggests that AIAs may be effective only on few outlier records, we show they can be very effective even on randomly selected records. We evaluate attacks on synthetic datasets ranging from 10^3 to 10^6 records, showing that even for the same generative model, the attack effectiveness can drastically increase when a larger number of synthetic records is generated. Overall, our findings prove that synthetic data is subject to privacy-utility tradeoffs just like other anonymization techniques: when good utility is preserved, attribute inference can be a risk for many data subjects.

These penalties are effective in practice, but are lacking in robust theoretical justifications. In this paper we develop and present a novel theoretically justified hypothesis test of split quality for gradient boosted tree ensembles and demonstrate that using this method instead of the common penalty terms leads to a significant reduction in out of sample loss.

However, the common practice in model-based reinforcement learning is to learn models that model every aspect of the agent's environment, regardless of whether they are important in coming up with optimal decisions or not. In this paper, we argue that such models are not particularly well-suited for performing scalable and robust planning in lifelong reinforcement learning scenarios and we propose new kinds of models that only model the relevant aspects of the environment, which we call \"minimal value-equivalent partial models\". After providing a formal definition for these models, we provide theoretical results demonstrating the scalability advantages of performing planning with such models and then perform experiments to empirically illustrate our theoretical results. Then, we provide some useful heuristics on how to learn these kinds of models with deep learning architectures and empirically demonstrate that models learned in such a way can allow for performing planning that is robust to distribution shifts and compounding model errors. Overall, both our theoretical and empirical results suggest that minimal value-equivalent partial models can provide significant benefits to performing scalable and robust planning in lifelong reinforcement learning scenarios.

Machine learning (ML) models have gained importance and are widely used for prediction of solar power plant performance. In this paper, the impact of weather parameters on solar PV power generation is estimated by several Ensemble ML (EML) models like Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Voting for the first time. The performance of chosen ML algorithms is validated by field dataset of a 10kWp solar PV power plant in Eastern India region. Furthermore, a complete test-bed framework has been designed for data mining as well as to select appropriate learning models. It also supports feature selection and reduction for dataset to reduce space and time complexity of the learning models. The results demonstrate greater prediction accuracy of around 96% for Stacking and Voting EML models. The proposed work is a generalized one and can be very useful for predicting the performance of large-scale solar PV power plants also. ",

    "abstract": "Humans can learn to operate the user interface (UI) of an application by reading an instruction manual or how-to guide. Along with text, these resources include visual content such as UI screenshots and images of application icons referenced in the text. We explore how to leverage this data to learn generic visio-linguistic representations of UI screens and their components. These representations are useful in many real applications, such as accessibility, voice navigation, and task automation. Prior UI representation models rely on UI metadata (UI trees and accessibility labels), which is often missing, incompletely defined, or not accessible. We avoid such a dependency, and propose Lexi, a pre-trained vision and language model designed to handle the unique features of UI screens, including their text richness and context sensitivity. To train Lexi we curate the UICaption dataset consisting of 114k UI images paired with descriptions of their functionality. We evaluate Lexi on four tasks: UI action entailment, instruction-based UI image retrieval, grounding referring expressions, and UI entity recognition. ",

    "abstract": "Electrocardiography (ECG) signals can be considered as multi-variable time-series. The state-of-the-art ECG data classification approaches, based on either feature engineering or deep learning techniques, treat separately spectral and time domains in machine learning systems. No spectral-time domain communication mechanism inside the classifier model can be found in current approaches, leading to difficulties in identifying complex ECG forms. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning model named Spectral Cross-domain neural network (SCDNN) with a new block called Soft-adaptive threshold spectral enhancement (SATSE), to simultaneously reveal the key information embedded in spectral and time domains inside the neural network. More precisely, the domain-cross information is captured by a general Convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone, and different information sources are merged by a self-adaptive mechanism to mine the connection between time and spectral domains. In SATSE, the knowledge from time and spectral domains is extracted via the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) with soft trainable thresholds in modified Sigmoid functions. The proposed SCDNN is tested with several classification tasks implemented on the public ECG databases \\textit{PTB-XL} and \\textit{MIT-BIH}. SCDNN outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches with a low computational cost regarding a variety of metrics in all classification tasks on both databases, by finding appropriate domains from the infinite spectral mapping. The convergence of the trainable thresholds in the spectral domain is also numerically investigated in this paper. The robust performance of SCDNN provides a new perspective to exploit knowledge across deep learning models from time and spectral domains.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel machine learning framework for detecting Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PxAF), a pathological characteristic of Electrocardiogram (ECG) that can lead to fatal conditions such as heart attack. To enhance the learning process, the framework involves a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) along with a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) in the data preparation and classifier optimization phases. The GAN is innovatively invoked to overcome the class imbalance of the training data by producing the synthetic ECG for PxAF class in a certified manner. The effect of the certified GAN is statistically validated. Instead of using a general-purpose classifier, the NAS automatically designs a highly accurate convolutional neural network architecture customized for the PxAF classification task. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed framework exhibits a high value of 99% which not only enhances state-of-the-art by up to 5.1%, but also improves the classification performance of the two widely-accepted baseline methods, ResNet-18, and Auto-Sklearn, by 2.2% and 6.1%.

Semiconductor-transistor-based circuits (STbCs) have struggled in increasing the GHz frequency. Emerging as an alternative to STbC, the superconducting electrons (SCE) technology promises higher-speed clock frequencies at ultra-low power consumption. The rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ) circuits have a theoretical potential for three orders of magnitude reduction in power while operating at clock frequencies higher than 100 GHz. Although the security in semiconductor technology has been extensively researched and developed, the security design in the superconducting field requires field demands attention. In this paper, C-SAR is presented that aims to protect the superconducting circuit electronics from Boolean satisfiability (SAT) based attacks. The SAT attack is an attack that can break all the existing combinational logic locking techniques. C-SAR can immunize against SAT attacks by increasing the key search space and prolonging the clock cycles of attack inputs. Even in the worst case of C-SAR, in face of S-SAT a specially designed SAT attack, C-SAR can also soar the attack cost exponentially with key bits first, then linearly with the length of camouflaged DFF array. We have shown in this work that the cost of C-SAR is manageable as it only linearly increases as a function of key bits. ",

However, challenges including privacy-utility tradeoff, learning reliability, and AI model thefts hinder the deployment of FL in real metaverse applications. In this paper, we exploit the pervasive social ties among users/avatars to advance a social-aware hierarchical FL framework, i.e., SocialFL for a better privacy-utility tradeoff in the social metaverse. Then, an aggregator-free robust FL mechanism based on blockchain is devised with a new block structure and an improved consensus protocol featured with on/off-chain collaboration. Furthermore, based on smart contracts and digital watermarks, an automatic federated AI (FedAI) model ownership provenance mechanism is designed to prevent AI model thefts and collusive avatars in social metaverse.

In this context, we have proposed a deep neural network based transfer learning algorithm ETHNO-DAANN with adversarial adaptation for ethnographic engagement prediction.

However, the lack of domain generalization of artificial neural networks is an important obstacle to their deployment in changing clinical environments. In this work, we explore the domain generalization of deep learning methods for mass detection in digital mammography and analyze in-depth the sources of domain shift in a large-scale multi-center setting. To this end, we compare the performance of eight state-of-the-art detection methods, including Transformer-based models, trained in a single domain and tested in five unseen domains. Moreover, a single-source mass detection training pipeline is designed to improve the domain generalization without requiring images from the new domain. The results show that our workflow generalizes better than state-of-the-art transfer learning-based approaches in four out of five domains while reducing the domain shift caused by the different acquisition protocols and scanner manufacturers. Subsequently, an extensive analysis is performed to identify the covariate shifts with bigger effects on the detection performance, such as due to differences in patient age, breast density, mass size, and mass malignancy. Ultimately, this comprehensive study provides key insights and best practices for future research on domain generalization in deep learning-based breast cancer detection. ",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Detection of structural variants (SV) from the alignment of sample DNA reads to the reference genome is an important problem in understanding human diseases. Long reads that can span repeat regions, along with an accurate alignment of these long reads play an important role in identifying novel SVs. Long read sequencers such as nanopore sequencing can address this problem by providing very long reads but with high error rates, making accurate alignment challenging. Many errors induced by nanopore sequencing have a bias because of the physics of the sequencing process and proper utilization of these error characteristics can play an important role in designing a robust aligner for SV detection problems. In this paper, we design and evaluate HQAlign, an aligner for SV detection using nanopore sequenced reads. The key ideas of HQAlign include (i) using basecalled nanopore reads along with the nanopore physics to improve alignments for SVs (ii) incorporating SV specific changes to the alignment pipeline (iii) adapting these into existing state-of-the-art long read aligner pipeline, minimap2 (v2.24), for efficient alignments. Results: We show that HQAlign captures about 4%-6% complementary SVs across different datasets which are missed by minimap2 alignments while having a standalone performance at par with minimap2 for real nanopore reads data. For the common SV calls between HQAlign and minimap2, HQAlign improves the start and the end breakpoint accuracy for about 10%-50% of SVs across different datasets. Moreover, HQAlign improves the alignment rate to 89.35% from minimap2 85.64% for nanopore reads alignment to recent telomere-to-telomere CHM13 assembly, and it improves to 86.65% from 83.48% for nanopore reads alignment to GRCh37 human genome.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning is an increasingly popular approach to unsupervised learning, achieving state-of-the-art results. A prevalent approach consists in contrasting data points and noise points within a classification task: this requires a good noise distribution which is notoriously hard to specify. While a comprehensive theory is missing, it is widely assumed that the optimal noise distribution should in practice be made equal to the data distribution, as in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We here empirically and theoretically challenge this assumption. We turn to Noise-Contrastive Estimation (NCE) which grounds this self-supervised task as an estimation problem of an energy-based model of the data. This ties the optimality of the noise distribution to the sample efficiency of the estimator, which is rigorously defined as its asymptotic variance, or mean-squared error. In the special case where the normalization constant only is unknown, we show that NCE recovers a family of Importance Sampling estimators for which the optimal noise is indeed equal to the data distribution. However, in the general case where the energy is also unknown, we prove that the optimal noise density is the data density multiplied by a correction term based on the Fisher score. In particular, the optimal noise distribution is different from the data distribution, and is even from a different family. Nevertheless, we soberly conclude that the optimal noise may be hard to sample from, and the gain in efficiency can be modest compared to choosing the noise distribution equal to the data's. ",

In this paper, several parametric and non-parametric features were calculated, where the non-parametric features were calculated using the parametric features. $8$ seismic features were calculated using Gutenberg-Richter law, the total recurrence, and the seismic energy release. Additionally, criterions such as Maximum Relevance and Maximum Redundancy were applied to choose the pertinent features. These features along with others were used as input for an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) Regression Model. Magnitude and time data of $5$ decades from the Assam-Guwahati region were used to create this model for magnitude prediction. The Testing Accuracy and Testing Speed were computed taking the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the parameter for evaluating the mode. As confirmed by the results, ELM shows better scalability with much faster training and testing speed (up to a thousand times faster) than traditional Support Vector Machines. The testing RMSE came out to be around $0.097$. To further test the model's robustness -- magnitude-time data from California was used to calculate the seismic indicators which were then fed into an ELM and then tested on the Assam-Guwahati region. The model proves to be robust and can be implemented in early warning systems as it continues to be a major part of Disaster Response and management. ",

Probabilistic frameworks in conjunction with computationally efficient numerical hydrodynamic tools have been developed that allow researchers and designers to better understand extremes. However, the ability of these hydrodynamic tools to represent the physics quantitatively during extreme events is limited. Previous research successfully implemented the critical wave groups (CWG) probabilistic method with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Although the CWG method allows for less simulation time than a Monte Carlo approach, the large quantity of simulations required is cost prohibitive. The objective of the present paper is to reduce the computational cost of implementing CWG with CFD, through the construction of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. After training the models with a limited quantity of simulations, the models can provide a larger quantity of predictions to calculate the probability. The new framework is demonstrated with a 2-D midship section of the Office of Naval Research Tumblehome (ONRT) hull in Sea State 7 and beam seas at zero speed. The new framework is able to produce predictions that are representative of a purely CFD-driven CWG framework, with two orders of magnitude of computational cost savings. ",

Here, we propose the EEG opto-processor based on diffractive photonic computing units (DPUs) to effectively process the extracranial and intracranial EEG signals and perform epileptic seizure detection. The signals of EEG channels within a second-time window are optically encoded as inputs to the constructed diffractive neural networks for classification, which monitors the brain state to determine whether it's the symptom of an epileptic seizure or not. We developed both the free-space and integrated DPUs as edge computing systems and demonstrated their applications for real-time epileptic seizure detection with the benchmark datasets, i.e., the CHB-MIT extracranial EEG dataset and Epilepsy-iEEG-Multicenter intracranial EEG dataset, at high computing performance. Along with the channel selection mechanism, both the numerical evaluations and experimental results validated the sufficient high classification accuracies of the proposed opto-processors for supervising the clinical diagnosis.

    "title": "CovidRhythm: A Deep Learning Model for Passive Prediction of Covid-19  using Biobehavioral Rhythms Derived from Wearable Physiological Data",
    "abstract": "To investigate whether a deep learning model can detect Covid-19 from disruptions in the human body's physiological (heart rate) and rest-activity rhythms (rhythmic dysregulation) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We propose CovidRhythm, a novel Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) Network with Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) that combines sensor and rhythmic features extracted from heart rate and activity (steps) data gathered passively using consumer-grade smart wearable to predict Covid-19. A total of 39 features were extracted (standard deviation, mean, min/max/avg length of sedentary and active bouts) from wearable sensor data. Biobehavioral rhythms were modeled using nine parameters (mesor, amplitude, acrophase, and intra-daily variability). These features were then input to CovidRhythm for predicting Covid-19 in the incubation phase (one day before biological symptoms manifest). A combination of sensor and biobehavioral rhythm features achieved the highest AUC-ROC of 0.79 [Sensitivity = 0.69, Specificity=0.89, F$_{0.1}$ = 0.76], outperforming prior approaches in discriminating Covid-positive patients from healthy controls using 24 hours of historical wearable physiological. Rhythmic features were the most predictive of Covid-19 infection when utilized either alone or in conjunction with sensor features. Sensor features predicted healthy subjects best. Circadian rest-activity rhythms that combine 24h activity and sleep information were the most disrupted. CovidRhythm demonstrates that biobehavioral rhythms derived from consumer-grade wearable data can facilitate timely Covid-19 detection. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to detect Covid-19 using deep learning and biobehavioral rhythms features derived from consumer-grade wearable data. ",

    "title": "Co-channel Interference Management for the Next-Generation Heterogeneous  Networks using Deep Leaning",
    "abstract": "The connectivity of public-safety mobile users (MU) in the co-existence of a public-safety network (PSN), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and LTE-based railway networks (LRN) needs a thorough investigation. UAVs are deployed as mobile base stations (BSs) for cell-edge coverage enhancement for MU. The co-existence of heterogeneous networks gives rise to the issue of co-channel interference due to the utilization of the same frequency band. By considering both sharing and non-sharing of radio access channels (RAC), we analyze co-channel interference in the downlink system of PSN, UAV, and LRN. As the LRN control signal demands high reliability and low latency, we provide higher priority to LRN users when allocating resources from the LRN RAC shared with MUs. Moreover, UAVs are deployed at the cell edge to increase the performance of cell-edge users. Therefore, interference control techniques enable LRN, PSN, and UAVs to cohabit in a scenario of sharing RAC. By offloading more PSN UEs to the LRN or UAVs, the resource utilization of the LRN and UAVs BSs is enhanced. In this paper, we aim to adopt deep learning (DL) based on enhanced inter-cell-interference coordination (eICIC) and further enhanced ICIC (FeICIC) strategies to deal with the interference from the PSN to the LRN and UAVs. Among LRN, PSN BS, and UAVs, a DL-based coordinated multipoint (CoMP) link technique is utilized to enhance the performance of PSN MUs. Therefore, if radio access channels are shared, utilization of DL-based FeICIC and CoMP for coordinated scheduling gives the best performance. ",
