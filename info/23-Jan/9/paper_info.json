    "abstract": "A new approach is introduced to classify faults in rotating machinery based on the total energy signature estimated from sensor measurements. The overall goal is to go beyond using black-box models and incorporate additional physical constraints that govern the behavior of mechanical systems. Observational data is used to train Hamiltonian neural networks that describe the conserved energy of the system for normal and various abnormal regimes. The estimated total energy function, in the form of the weights of the Hamiltonian neural network, serves as the new feature vector to discriminate between the faults using off-the-shelf classification models. The experimental results are obtained using the MaFaulDa database, where the proposed model yields a promising area under the curve (AUC) of $0.78$ for the binary classification (normal vs abnormal) and $0.84$ for the multi-class problem (normal, and $5$ different abnormal regimes).

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are a state-of-the-art technology, capable of outstanding performance in many key tasks. However, it is challenging to integrate DNNs into safety-critical systems, such as those in the aerospace or automotive domains, due to the risk of adversarial inputs: slightly perturbed inputs that can cause the DNN to make grievous mistakes. Adversarial inputs have been shown to plague even modern DNNs; and so the risks they pose must be measured and mitigated to allow the safe deployment of DNNs in safety-critical systems. Here, we present a novel and scalable tool called gRoMA, which uses a statistical approach for formally measuring the global categorial robustness of a DNN - i.e., the probability of randomly encountering an adversarial input for a specific output category. Our tool operates on pre-trained, black-box classification DNNs. It randomly generates input samples that belong to an output category of interest, measures the DNN's susceptibility to adversarial inputs around these inputs, and then aggregates the results to infer the overall global robustness of the DNN up to some small bounded error. For evaluation purposes, we used gRoMA to measure the global robustness of the widespread Densenet DNN model over the CIFAR10 dataset and our results exposed significant gaps in the robustness of the different output categories. This experiment demonstrates the scalability of the new approach and showcases its potential for allowing DNNs to be deployed within critical systems of interest. ",

To address this problem we introduce the novel task of visual narration detection, which entails determining whether a narration is visually depicted by the actions in the video. We propose \"What You Say is What You Show\" (WYS^2), a method that leverages multi-modal cues and pseudo-labeling to learn to detect visual narrations with only weakly labeled data. We further generalize our approach to operate on only audio input, learning properties of the narrator's voice that hint if they are currently doing what they describe. Our model successfully detects visual narrations in in-the-wild videos, outperforming strong baselines, and we demonstrate its impact for state-of-the-art summarization and alignment of instructional video.

What makes this architecture unique is the synergistic employment of a traditional, Adaptive Neural Network (ANN) controller and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. LSTM structures, unlike the standard feed-forward neural networks, can take advantage of the dependencies in an input sequence, which can contain critical information that can help predict uncertainty. Through a novel training method we introduced, the LSTM network learns to compensate for the deficiencies of the ANN controller during sudden changes in plant dynamics. This substantially improves the transient response of the system and allows the controller to quickly react to unexpected events. Through careful simulation studies, we demonstrate that this architecture can improve the estimation accuracy on a diverse set of uncertainties for an indefinite time span. We also provide an analysis of the contributions of the ANN controller and LSTM network to the control input, identifying their individual roles in compensating low and high-frequency error dynamics. This analysis provides insight into why and how the LSTM augmentation improves the system's transient response. The stability of the overall system is also shown via a rigorous Lyapunov analysis. ",

Despite their importance, a formal framework that supports both these forms of reasoning has, until now, been lacking. We offer a solution in the form of (structural) causal games, which can be seen as extending Pearl's causal hierarchy to the game-theoretic domain, or as extending Koller and Milch's multi-agent influence diagrams to the causal domain. We then consider three key questions: i) How can the (causal) dependencies in games - either between variables, or between strategies - be modelled in a uniform, principled manner? ii) How may causal queries be computed in causal games, and what assumptions does this require? iii) How do causal games compare to existing formalisms? To address question i), we introduce mechanised games, which encode dependencies between agents' decision rules and the distributions governing the game. In response to question ii), we present definitions of predictions, interventions, and counterfactuals, and discuss the assumptions required for each. Regarding question iii), we describe correspondences between causal games and other formalisms, and explain how causal games can be used to answer queries that other causal or game-theoretic models do not support. Finally, we highlight possible applications of causal games, aided by an extensive open-source Python library. ",

    "abstract": "Understanding the properties of time-indexed multivariate data has been a predominant topic mainly to address open issues in multivariate time series analysis. Usually, the methodologies used to analyze multivariate time series are based on adapting approaches for univariate settings or on assumptions and parameters for specific problems. A different strategy uses complex network to obtain an additional and reduced representation of temporal and causal properties of the time series data. Recent strategies involve mapping multivariate time series into high-level network structures, specifically into multiplex networks representing interconnections between contemporary timestamps of different time series components. In this work, we propose a new mapping method that takes advantage of the entire structure of multilayer networks. We introduce the multilayer horizontal visibility graph that is based on the new concept of cross-horizontal visibility between lagged timestamps of different components, which allows describing the cross-dimension dependencies via inter-layer edges. We use a set of existing topological measures of multilayer networks as well as a novel measure to evaluate and validate our approach, which is parameter-free, does not require data pre-processing and is applicable to any kind of multivariate time series data. We provide an extensive experimental evaluation, where we explore the proposed topological measures, showing that the inter-layer edges based on cross-horizontal visibility preserve more information about the time series data after the mappings, information that would inevitably be lost using mapping methods that result in single-layer and multiplex structures. We also verify that the information mapped by the inter-layer edges is not enough on its own, but that it complements the data information captured by the commonly used intra-layer edges. ",

    "abstract": "With tools like GitHub Copilot, automatic code suggestion is no longer a dream in software engineering. These tools, based on large language models, are typically trained on massive corpora of code mined from unvetted public sources. As a result, these models are susceptible to data poisoning attacks where an adversary manipulates the model's training or fine-tuning phases by injecting malicious data. Poisoning attacks could be designed to influence the model's suggestions at run time for chosen contexts, such as inducing the model into suggesting insecure code payloads. To achieve this, prior poisoning attacks explicitly inject the insecure code payload into the training data, making the poisoning data detectable by static analysis tools that can remove such malicious data from the training set. In this work, we demonstrate two novel data poisoning attacks, COVERT and TROJANPUZZLE, that can bypass static analysis by planting malicious poisoning data in out-of-context regions such as docstrings. Our most novel attack, TROJANPUZZLE, goes one step further in generating less suspicious poisoning data by never including certain (suspicious) parts of the payload in the poisoned data, while still inducing a model that suggests the entire payload when completing code (i.e., outside docstrings). This makes TROJANPUZZLE robust against signature-based dataset-cleansing methods that identify and filter out suspicious sequences from the training data. Our evaluation against two model sizes demonstrates that both COVERT and TROJANPUZZLE have significant implications for how practitioners should select code used to train or tune code-suggestion models.

    "abstract": "Dense matrix multiply (MM) serves as one of the most heavily used kernels in deep learning applications. To cope with the high computation demands of these applications, heterogeneous architectures featuring both FPGA and dedicated ASIC accelerators have emerged as promising platforms. For example, the AMD/Xilinx Versal ACAP architecture combines general-purpose CPU cores and programmable logic with AI Engine processors optimized for AI/ML. With 400 AIEs, it provides up to 6.4 TFLOPs performance for 32-bit floating-point data. However, machine learning models often contain both large and small MM operations. While large MM operations can be parallelized efficiently across many cores, small MM operations typically cannot. We observe that executing some small MM layers from the BERT natural language processing model on a large, monolithic MM accelerator in Versal ACAP achieved less than 5% of the theoretical peak performance. Therefore, one key question arises: How can we design accelerators to fully use the abundant computation resources under limited communication bandwidth for applications with multiple MM layers of diverse sizes? We identify the biggest system throughput bottleneck resulting from the mismatch of massive computation resources of one monolithic accelerator and the various MM layers of small sizes in the application. To resolve this problem, we propose the CHARM framework to compose multiple diverse MM accelerator architectures working concurrently towards different layers in one application. We deploy the CHARM framework for four different applications, including BERT, ViT, NCF, MLP, on the AMD Versal ACAP VCK190 evaluation board. Our experiments show that we achieve 1.46 TFLOPs, 1.61 TFLOPs, 1.74 TFLOPs, and 2.94 TFLOPs inference throughput for BERT, ViT, NCF and MLP, which obtain 5.40x, 32.51x, 1.00x and 1.00x throughput gains compared to one monolithic accelerator.

Existing methods mainly establish 3D representations from multi-view images and adopt a dense detection head for object detection, or employ object queries distributed in 3D space to localize objects. In this paper, we design Multi-View 2D Objects guided 3D Object Detector (MV2D), which can be equipped with any 2D object detector to promote multi-view 3D object detection. Since 2D detections can provide valuable priors for object existence, MV2D exploits 2D detector to generate object queries conditioned on the rich image semantics. These dynamically generated queries enable MV2D to detect objects in larger 3D space without increased computational costs and shows a strong capability of localizing 3D objects. For the generated queries, we design a sparse cross attention module to force them to focus on the features of specific objects, which reduces the computational cost and suppresses interference from noises. The evaluation results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that dynamic object queries and sparse feature aggregation do not harm 3D detection capability. MV2D also exhibits a state-of-the-art performance among existing methods. We hope MV2D can serve as a new baseline for future research. ",

Here, we propose a model of interacting beliefs as a unifying framework, from which both simple and complex contagion dynamics can organically arise. Our model also elucidates how a fundamental mechanism of complex contagion -- resistance -- can come about from cognitive mechanisms.

A popular solution to 3D lane detection is to first transform the front-viewed (FV) images or features into the bird-eye-view (BEV) space with inverse perspective mapping (IPM) and detect lanes from BEV features. However, the reliance of IPM on flat ground assumption and loss of context information makes it inaccurate to restore 3D information from BEV representations. An attempt has been made to get rid of BEV and predict 3D lanes from FV representations directly, while it still underperforms other BEV-based methods given its lack of structured representation for 3D lanes. In this paper, we define 3D lane anchors in the 3D space and propose a BEV-free method named Anchor3DLane to predict 3D lanes directly from FV representations. 3D lane anchors are projected to the FV features to extract their features which contain both good structural and context information to make accurate predictions. We further extend Anchor3DLane to the multi-frame setting to incorporate temporal information for performance improvement. In addition, we also develop a global optimization method that makes use of the equal-width property between lanes to reduce the lateral error of predictions. Extensive experiments on three popular 3D lane detection benchmarks show that our Anchor3DLane outperforms previous BEV-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performances. ",

This task requires the robot to find an object of a certain category efficiently in an unknown domestic environment. Recent works focus on exploiting layout relationships by graph neural networks (GNNs). However, most of them obtain robot actions directly from observations in an end-to-end manner via an incomplete relation graph, which is not interpretable and reliable. We decouple this task and propose ReVoLT, a hierarchical framework: (a) an object detection visual front-end, (b) a high-level reasoner (infers semantic sub-goals), (c) an intermediate-level planner (computes geometrical positions), and (d) a low-level controller (executes actions). ReVoLT operates with a multi-layer semantic-spatial topological graph. The reasoner uses multiform structured relations as priors, which are obtained from combinatorial relation extraction networks composed of unsupervised GraphSAGE, GCN, and GraphRNN-based Region Rollout. The reasoner performs with Upper Confidence Bound for Tree (UCT) to infer semantic sub-goals, accounting for trade-offs between exploitation (depth-first searching) and exploration (regretting). The lightweight intermediate-level planner generates instantaneous spatial sub-goal locations via an online constructed Voronoi local graph. The simulation experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves better performance in the target-driven navigation tasks and generalizes well, which has an 80% improvement compared to the existing state-of-the-art method.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has been widely used to solve various code-based tasks by building deep code models based on a large number of code snippets. However, deep code models are still vulnerable to adversarial attacks. As source code is discrete and has to strictly stick to the grammar and semantics constraints, the adversarial attack techniques in other domains are not applicable. Moreover, the attack techniques specific to deep code models suffer from the effectiveness issue due to the enormous attack space. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack technique (i.e., CODA). Its key idea is to use the code differences between the target input and reference inputs (that have small code differences but different prediction results with the target one) to guide the generation of adversarial examples. It considers both structure differences and identifier differences to preserve the original semantics. Hence, the attack space can be largely reduced as the one constituted by the two kinds of code differences, and thus the attack process can be largely improved by designing corresponding equivalent structure transformations and identifier renaming transformations. Our experiments on 10 deep code models (i.e., two pre trained models with five code-based tasks) demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CODA, the naturalness of its generated examples, and its capability of defending against attacks after adversarial fine-tuning. For example, CODA improves the state-of-the-art techniques (i.e., CARROT and ALERT) by 79.25% and 72.20% on average in terms of the attack success rate, respectively. ",

However, due to the small sample size and the high dimension of available neuroimaging data, the performance of existing methods is often limited. Multi-site data could enhance the statistical power and sample size, while they are often subject to inter-site heterogeneity and data-sharing policies. In this paper, we propose a federated joint estimator, NOTEARS-PFL, for simultaneous learning of multiple Bayesian networks (BNs) with continuous optimization, to identify disease-induced alterations in MDD patients. We incorporate information shared between sites and site-specific information into the proposed federated learning framework to learn personalized BN structures by introducing the group fused lasso penalty. We develop the alternating direction method of multipliers, where in the local update step, the neuroimaging data is processed at each local site. Then the learned network structures are transmitted to the center for the global update. In particular, we derive a closed-form expression for the local update step and use the iterative proximal projection method to deal with the group fused lasso penalty in the global update step. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-world multi-site rs-fMRI datasets.

    "abstract": "Conformal prediction is a learning framework controlling prediction coverage of prediction sets, which can be built on any learning algorithm for point prediction. This work proposes a learning framework named conformal loss-controlling prediction, which extends conformal prediction to the situation where the value of a loss function needs to be controlled. Different from existing works about risk-controlling prediction sets and conformal risk control with the purpose of controlling the expected values of loss functions, the proposed approach in this paper focuses on the loss for any test object, which is an extension of conformal prediction from miscoverage loss to some general loss. The controlling guarantee is proved under the assumption of exchangeability of data in finite-sample cases and the framework is tested empirically for classification with a class-varying loss and statistical postprocessing of numerical weather forecasting applications, which are introduced as point-wise classification and point-wise regression problems. All theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our loss-controlling approach. ",

Our approach allows for more flexible manipulation of text and thus can generate more diverse data while keeping the original event structure unchanged as much as possible. Specifically, it first randomly masks out an adjunct sentence fragment and then infills a variable-length text span with a fine-tuned infilling model. The main advantage lies in that it can replace a fragment of arbitrary length in the text with another fragment of variable length, compared to the existing methods which can only replace a single word or a fixed-length fragment. On trigger and argument extraction tasks, the proposed framework is more effective than baseline methods and it demonstrates particularly strong results in the low-resource setting. Our further analysis shows that it achieves a good balance between diversity and distributional similarity. ",

However, for complex multimodal information and sparse training data, it is usually difficult to achieve interpretability and high accuracy simultaneously for most methods. To address this difficulty, a new model is developed in this paper, namely Interpretable Multimodal Knowledge Graph Answer Prediction via Sequence Modeling (IMKGA-SM). First, a multi-modal fine-grained fusion method is proposed, and Vgg16 and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques are adopted to effectively extract text information from images and images. Then, the knowledge graph link prediction task is modelled as an offline reinforcement learning Markov decision model, which is then abstracted into a unified sequence framework. An interactive perception-based reward expectation mechanism and a special causal masking mechanism are designed, which ``converts\" the query into an inference path. Then, an autoregressive dynamic gradient adjustment mechanism is proposed to alleviate the insufficient problem of multimodal optimization. Finally, two datasets are adopted for experiments, and the popular SOTA baselines are used for comparison. The results show that the developed IMKGA-SM achieves much better performance than SOTA baselines on multimodal link prediction datasets of different sizes. ",

In the context of topic modeling, most vocabulary is either irrelevant for uncovering underlying topics or contains strong relationships with relevant concepts, impacting the interpretability of these topics. Furthermore, their limited expressiveness and dependency on language demand considerable computation resources. Hence, we propose a novel approach for cluster-based topic modeling that employs conceptual entities. Entities are language-agnostic representations of real-world concepts rich in relational information. To this end, we extract vector representations of entities from (i) an encyclopedic corpus using a language model; and (ii) a knowledge base using a graph neural network. We demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art topic models across coherency metrics and find that the explicit knowledge encoded in the graph-based embeddings provides more coherent topics than the implicit knowledge encoded with the contextualized embeddings of language models.

    "abstract": "Voice over LTE (VoLTE) and Voice over NR (VoNR) are two similar technologies that have been widely deployed by operators to provide a better calling experience in LTE and 5G networks, respectively. The VoLTE/NR protocols rely on the security features of the underlying LTE/5G network to protect users' privacy such that nobody can monitor calls and learn details about call times, duration, and direction. In this paper, we introduce a new privacy attack which enables adversaries to analyse encrypted LTE/5G traffic and recover any VoLTE/NR call details. We achieve this by implementing a novel mobile-relay adversary which is able to remain undetected by using an improved physical layer parameter guessing procedure. This adversary facilitates the recovery of encrypted configuration messages exchanged between victim devices and the mobile network. We further propose an identity mapping method which enables our mobile-relay adversary to link a victim's network identifiers to the phone number efficiently, requiring a single VoLTE protocol message. We evaluate the real-world performance of our attacks using four modern commercial off-the-shelf phones and two representative, commercial network carriers. We collect over 60 hours of traffic between the phones and the mobile networks and execute 160 VoLTE calls, which we use to successfully identify patterns in the physical layer parameter allocation and in VoLTE traffic, respectively. Our real-world experiments show that our mobile-relay works as expected in all test cases, and the VoLTE activity logs recovered describe the actual communication with 100% accuracy. Finally, we show that we can link network identifiers such as International Mobile Subscriber Identities (IMSI), Subscriber Concealed Identifiers (SUCI) and/or Globally Unique Temporary Identifiers (GUTI) to phone numbers while remaining undetected by the victim.

    "abstract": "Code models, such as CodeBERT and CodeT5, offer general-purpose representations of code and play a vital role in supporting downstream automated software engineering tasks. Most recently, code models were revealed to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. A code model that is backdoor-attacked can behave normally on clean examples but will produce pre-defined malicious outputs on examples injected with triggers that activate the backdoors. Existing backdoor attacks on code models use unstealthy and easy-to-detect triggers. This paper aims to investigate the vulnerability of code models with stealthy backdoor attacks. To this end, we propose AFRAIDOOR (Adversarial Feature as Adaptive Backdoor). AFRAIDOOR achieves stealthiness by leveraging adversarial perturbations to inject adaptive triggers into different inputs. We evaluate AFRAIDOOR on three widely adopted code models (CodeBERT, PLBART and CodeT5) and two downstream tasks (code summarization and method name prediction). We find that around 85% of adaptive triggers in AFRAIDOOR bypass the detection in the defense process. By contrast, only less than 12% of the triggers from previous work bypass the defense. When the defense method is not applied, both AFRAIDOOR and baselines have almost perfect attack success rates. However, once a defense is applied, the success rates of baselines decrease dramatically to 10.47% and 12.06%, while the success rate of AFRAIDOOR are 77.05% and 92.98% on the two tasks. Our finding exposes security weaknesses in code models under stealthy backdoor attacks and shows that the state-of-the-art defense method cannot provide sufficient protection. We call for more research efforts in understanding security threats to code models and developing more effective countermeasures. ",

This article explores topic models for clustering terminal session commands collected from honeypots, which are special network hosts designed to entice malicious attackers. The main practical implications of clustering the sessions are two-fold: finding similar groups of attacks, and identifying outliers. A range of statistical topic models are considered, adapted to the structures of command-line syntax. In particular, concepts of primary and secondary topics, and then session-level and command-level topics, are introduced into the models to improve interpretability. The proposed methods are further extended in a Bayesian nonparametric fashion to allow unboundedness in the vocabulary size and the number of latent intents. The methods are shown to discover an unusual MIRAI variant which attempts to take over existing cryptocurrency coin-mining infrastructure, not detected by traditional topic-modelling approaches. ",

All datasets are evaluated in terms of individual samples and their correlations with each other. In the following, both linear and deep learning approaches are used to attack these PUF simulations and comprehensively investigate the impact of different factors on the datasets in terms of their security level against attackers. In addition, the differences between the two attack methods in terms of their performance are highlighted using several independent metrics. Several improvements to these models and new attacks will be introduced and investigated sequentially, with the goal of progressively improving modeling performance. This will lead to the development of an attack capable of almost perfectly predicting the outputs of the simulated PUF. In addition, data from a real optical PUF is examined and both compared to that of the simulation and used to see how the machine learning models presented would perform in the real world.

    "abstract": "As the perception range of LiDAR expands, LiDAR-based 3D object detection contributes ever-increasingly to the long-range perception in autonomous driving. Mainstream 3D object detectors often build dense feature maps, where the cost is quadratic to the perception range, making them hardly scale up to the long-range settings. To enable efficient long-range detection, we first propose a fully sparse object detector termed FSD. FSD is built upon the general sparse voxel encoder and a novel sparse instance recognition (SIR) module. SIR groups the points into instances and applies highly-efficient instance-wise feature extraction. The instance-wise grouping sidesteps the issue of the center feature missing, which hinders the design of the fully sparse architecture. To further enjoy the benefit of fully sparse characteristic, we leverage temporal information to remove data redundancy and propose a super sparse detector named FSD++. FSD++ first generates residual points, which indicate the point changes between consecutive frames. The residual points, along with a few previous foreground points, form the super sparse input data, greatly reducing data redundancy and computational overhead. We comprehensively analyze our method on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset, and state-of-the-art performance is reported. To showcase the superiority of our method in long-range detection, we also conduct experiments on Argoverse 2 Dataset, where the perception range ($200m$) is much larger than Waymo Open Dataset ($75m$).

We do so by using a small number of poisoned training samples with nearly imperceptible perturbations, without changing their labels. At inference time, we use a stealthy perturbation added to the attacked samples as a trigger. This perturbation is crafted as a universal adversarial perturbation (UAP), and the poison is crafted using gradient alignment coupled to this trigger.

However, the lack of hierarchy in a plain transformer makes it difficult to learn features at different scales and restrains its ability to extract localized features.

In this work, we propose two novel attention mechanisms as modularized hierarchical designs for transformer-based 3D detectors. To enable feature learning at different scales, we propose Simple Multi-Scale Attention that builds multi-scale tokens from a single-scale input feature. For localized feature aggregation, we propose Size-Adaptive Local Attention with adaptive attention ranges for every bounding box proposal. Both of our attention modules are model-agnostic network layers that can be plugged into existing point cloud transformers for end-to-end training. We evaluate our method on two widely used indoor 3D point cloud object detection benchmarks.

Power system data are often corrupted with outliers caused by large errors, fault conditions, power outages, and extreme weather, to name a few.

The weights used to bound the influence of the outliers are calculated using projection statistics, which are a robust version of Mahalanobis distances of the time series data points.

    "title": "Convolutional XGBoost (C-XGBOOST) Model for Brain Tumor Detection",
    "abstract": "Brain tumors are masses or abnormal growths of cells within the brain or the central spinal canal with symptoms such as headaches, seizures, weakness or numbness in the arms or legs, changes in personality or behaviour, nausea, vomiting, vision or hearing problems and dizziness. Conventional diagnosis of brain tumour involves some tests and procedure which may include the consideration of medical history, physical examination, imaging tests (such as CT or MRI scans), and biopsy (removal and examination of a small piece of the tumor tissue). These procedures, while effective, are mentally strenuous and time demanding due to the manual examination of the brain scans and the thorough evaluation of test results. It has been established in lots of medical research that brain tumours diagnosed and treated early generally tends to have a better prognosis. Deep learning techniques have evolved over the years and have demonstrated impressive and faster outcomes in the classification of brain tumours in medical imaging, with very little to no human interference. This study proposes a model for the early detection of brain tumours using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The proposed model, named C-XGBoost has a lower model complexity compared to purely CNNs, making it easier to train and less prone to overfitting. It is also better able to handle imbalanced and unstructured data, which are common issues in real-world medical image classification tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we employed a dataset of brain MRI images with and without tumours. ",

    "abstract": "The integration of multi-modal data, such as pathological images and genomic data, is essential for understanding cancer heterogeneity and complexity for personalized treatments, as well as for enhancing survival predictions. Despite the progress made in integrating pathology and genomic data, most existing methods cannot mine the complex inter-modality relations thoroughly. Additionally, identifying explainable features from these models that govern preclinical discovery and clinical prediction is crucial for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic response studies. We propose PONET- a novel biological pathway-informed pathology-genomic deep model that integrates pathological images and genomic data not only to improve survival prediction but also to identify genes and pathways that cause different survival rates in patients. Empirical results on six of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets show that our proposed method achieves superior predictive performance and reveals meaningful biological interpretations. The proposed method establishes insight into how to train biologically informed deep networks on multimodal biomedical data which will have general applicability for understanding diseases and predicting response and resistance to treatment.

However, the accuracies of different deep learning models in detecting esophagitis have yet to be compared. Thus, this study aimed to compare the accuracies of convolutional neural network models (GoogLeNet, ResNet-50, MobileNet V2, and MobileNet V3) in detecting esophagitis from the open Kvasir dataset of endoscopic images. Results showed that among the models, GoogLeNet achieved the highest F1-scores. Based on the average of true positive rate, MobileNet V3 predicted esophagitis more confidently than the other models. The results obtained using the models were also compared with those obtained using SHapley Additive exPlanations and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping. ",

    "abstract": "Vessel segmentation is widely used to help with vascular disease diagnosis. Vessels reconstructed using existing methods are often not sufficiently accurate to meet clinical use standards. This is because 3D vessel structures are highly complicated and exhibit unique characteristics, including sparsity and anisotropy. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid deep neural network for vessel segmentation. Our network consists of two cascaded subnetworks performing initial and refined segmentation respectively. The second subnetwork further has two tightly coupled components, a traditional CNN-based U-Net and a graph U-Net. Cross-network multi-scale feature fusion is performed between these two U-shaped networks to effectively support high-quality vessel segmentation. The entire cascaded network can be trained from end to end. The graph in the second subnetwork is constructed according to a vessel probability map as well as appearance and semantic similarities in the original CT volume. To tackle the challenges caused by the sparsity and anisotropy of vessels, a higher percentage of graph nodes are distributed in areas that potentially contain vessels while a higher percentage of edges follow the orientation of potential nearbyvessels. Extensive experiments demonstrate our deep network achieves state-of-the-art 3D vessel segmentation performance on multiple public and in-house datasets. ",

We develop a variable-altitude Poisson orbit process by accounting for the fact that satellites are always located on circular orbits and these orbits may have different altitudes. Then, the satellites on these orbits are modeled as the Poisson point processes conditionally on the orbit process. For this model, we derive the distribution of the distance to the nearest visible satellite, the outage probability, the Laplace functional of the proposed satellite Cox point process, and the Laplace transform of the interference under a general fading. The derived statistics allow one to evaluate the performance of such LEO satellite communication systems as functions of network parameters. ",

    "abstract": "To solve the problems of reduced accuracy and prolonging convergence time of through-the-wall radar (TWR) human motion due to wall attenuation, multipath effect, and system interference, we propose a multilink auto-encoding neural network (TWR-MCAE) data augmentation method. Specifically, the TWR-MCAE algorithm is jointly constructed by a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based data preprocessing module, an improved coordinate attention module, a compressed sensing learnable iterative shrinkage threshold reconstruction algorithm (LISTA) module, and an adaptive weight module. The data preprocessing module achieves wall clutter, human motion features, and noise subspaces separation. The improved coordinate attention module achieves clutter and noise suppression. The LISTA module achieves human motion feature enhancement. The adaptive weight module learns the weights and fuses the three subspaces. The TWR-MCAE can suppress the low-rank characteristics of wall clutter and enhance the sparsity characteristics in human motion at the same time. It can be linked before the classification step to improve the feature extraction capability without adding other prior knowledge or recollecting more data. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm gets a better peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), which increases the recognition accuracy and speeds up the training process of the back-end classifiers.

    "abstract": "The resolution and contrast of microscope imaging is often affected by aberrations introduced by imperfect optical systems and inhomogeneous refractive structures in specimens. Adaptive optics (AO) compensates these aberrations and restores diffraction limited performance. A wide range of AO solutions have been introduced, often tailored to a specific microscope type or application. Until now, a universal AO solution -- one that can be readily transferred between microscope modalities -- has not been deployed. We propose versatile and fast aberration correction using a physics-based machine learning (ML) assisted wavefront-sensorless AO control method. Unlike previous ML methods, we used a bespoke neural network (NN) architecture, designed using physical understanding of image formation, that was embedded in the control loop of the microscope. The approach means that not only is the resulting NN orders of magnitude simpler than previous NN methods, but the concept is translatable across microscope modalities. We demonstrated the method on a two-photon, a three-photon and a widefield three-dimensional (3D) structured illumination microscope. Results showed that the method outperformed commonly-used modal-based sensorless AO methods. We also showed that our ML-based method was robust in a range of challenging imaging conditions, such as extended 3D sample structures, specimen motion, low signal to noise ratio and activity-induced fluorescence fluctuations. Moreover, as the bespoke architecture encapsulated physical understanding of the imaging process, the internal NN configuration was no-longer a ``black box'', but provided physical insights on internal workings, which could influence future designs.
