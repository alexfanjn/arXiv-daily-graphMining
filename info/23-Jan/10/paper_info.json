    "abstract": "Synthesizing interaction-involved human motions has been challenging due to the high complexity of 3D environments and the diversity of possible human behaviors within. We present LAMA, Locomotion-Action-MAnipulation, to synthesize natural and plausible long term human movements in complex indoor environments. The key motivation of LAMA is to build a unified framework to encompass a series of motions commonly observable in our daily lives, including locomotion, interactions with 3D scenes, and manipulations of 3D objects. LAMA is based on a reinforcement learning framework coupled with a motion matching algorithm to synthesize locomotion and scene interaction seamlessly under common constraints and collision avoidance handling. LAMA also exploits a motion editing framework via manifold learning to cover possible variations in interaction and manipulation motions. We quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate that LAMA outperforms existing approaches in various challenging scenarios. Project webpage: https://lama-www.github.io/ . ",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is among the most prevalent cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Detection and removal of polyps at an early stage can help reduce mortality and even help in spreading over adjacent organs. Early polyp detection could save the lives of millions of patients over the world as well as reduce the clinical burden. However, the detection polyp rate varies significantly among endoscopists. There is numerous deep learning-based method proposed, however, most of the studies improve accuracy. Here, we propose a novel architecture, Residual Upsampling Network (RUPNet) for colon polyp segmentation that can process in real-time and show high recall and precision. The proposed architecture, RUPNet, is an encoder-decoder network that consists of three encoders, three decoder blocks, and some additional upsampling blocks at the end of the network. With an image size of $512 \\times 512$, the proposed method achieves an excellent real-time operation speed of 152.60 frames per second with an average dice coefficient of 0.7658, mean intersection of union of 0.6553, sensitivity of 0.8049, precision of 0.7995, and F2-score of 0.9361. The results suggest that RUPNet can give real-time feedback while retaining high accuracy indicating a good benchmark for early polyp detection. ",

    "abstract": "Mission-critical embedded software is critical to our society's infrastructure but can be subject to new security vulnerabilities as technology advances. When security issues arise, Reverse Engineers (REs) use Software Reverse Engineering (SRE) tools to analyze vulnerable binaries. However, existing tools have limited support, and REs undergo a time-consuming, costly, and error-prone process that requires experience and expertise to understand the behaviors of software and vulnerabilities. To improve these tools, we propose $\\textit{cfg2vec}$, a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (GNN) based approach. To represent binary, we propose a novel Graph-of-Graph (GoG) representation, combining the information of control-flow and function-call graphs. Our $\\textit{cfg2vec}$ learns how to represent each binary function compiled from various CPU architectures, utilizing hierarchical GNN and the siamese network-based supervised learning architecture. We evaluate $\\textit{cfg2vec}$'s capability of predicting function names from stripped binaries. Our results show that $\\textit{cfg2vec}$ outperforms the state-of-the-art by $24.54\\%$ in predicting function names and can even achieve $51.84\\%$ better given more training data. Additionally, $\\textit{cfg2vec}$ consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art for all CPU architectures, while the baseline requires multiple training to achieve similar performance. More importantly, our results demonstrate that our $\\textit{cfg2vec}$ could tackle binaries built from unseen CPU architectures, thus indicating that our approach can generalize the learned knowledge. Lastly, we demonstrate its practicability by implementing it as a Ghidra plugin used during resolving DARPA Assured MicroPatching (AMP) challenges. ",

It can result in useful and timely information for both travellers and transportation decision-makers. In this study, an Attention based Long Sort-Term Memory model (A-LSTM) is proposed to simultaneously predict traffic volume and speed in a critical rural road segmentation which connects Tehran to Chalus, the most tourist destination city in Iran. Moreover, this study compares the results of the A-LSTM model with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Both models show acceptable performance in predicting speed and flow. However, the A-LSTM model outperforms the LSTM in 5 and 15-minute intervals. In contrast, there is no meaningful difference between the two models for the 30-minute time interval. By comparing the performance of the models based on different time horizons, the 15-minute horizon model outperforms the others by reaching the lowest Mean Square Error (MSE) loss of 0.0032, followed by the 30 and 5-minutes horizons with 0.004 and 0.0051, respectively. In addition, this study compares the results of the models based on two transformations of temporal categorical input variables, one-hot or cyclic, for the 15-minute time interval. The results demonstrate that both LSTM and A-LSTM with cyclic feature encoding outperform those with one-hot feature encoding. ",

    "abstract": "Finding antenna designs that satisfy frequency requirements and are also optimal with respect to multiple physical criteria is a critical component in designing next generation hardware. However, such a process is non-trivial because the objective function is typically highly nonlinear and sensitive to subtle design change. Moreover, the objective to be optimized often involves electromagnetic (EM) simulations, which is slow and expensive with commercial simulation software. In this work, we propose a sample-efficient and accurate surrogate model, named CZP (Constant Zeros Poles), to directly estimate the scattering coefficients in the frequency domain of a given 2D planar antenna design, without using a simulator. CZP achieves this by predicting the complex zeros and poles for the frequency response of scattering coefficients, which we have theoretically justified for any linear PDE, including Maxwell's equations. Moreover, instead of using low-dimensional representations, CZP leverages a novel image-based representation for antenna topology inspired by the existing mesh-based EM simulation techniques, and attention-based neural network architectures. We demonstrate experimentally that CZP not only outperforms baselines in terms of test loss, but also is able to find 2D antenna designs verifiable by commercial software with only 40k training samples, when coupling with advanced sequential search techniques like reinforcement learning.

    "abstract": "Recently, relying on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), many methods for salient object detection in optical remote sensing images (ORSI-SOD) are proposed. However, most methods ignore the huge parameters and computational cost brought by CNNs, and only a few pay attention to the portability and mobility. To facilitate practical applications, in this paper, we propose a novel lightweight network for ORSI-SOD based on semantic matching and edge alignment, termed SeaNet. Specifically, SeaNet includes a lightweight MobileNet-V2 for feature extraction, a dynamic semantic matching module (DSMM) for high-level features, an edge self-alignment module (ESAM) for low-level features, and a portable decoder for inference. First, the high-level features are compressed into semantic kernels. Then, semantic kernels are used to activate salient object locations in two groups of high-level features through dynamic convolution operations in DSMM. Meanwhile, in ESAM, cross-scale edge information extracted from two groups of low-level features is self-aligned through L2 loss and used for detail enhancement. Finally, starting from the highest-level features, the decoder infers salient objects based on the accurate locations and fine details contained in the outputs of the two modules. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our lightweight SeaNet not only outperforms most state-of-the-art lightweight methods but also yields comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art conventional methods, while having only 2.76M parameters and running with 1.7G FLOPs for 288x288 inputs.

    "abstract": "The great success in graph neural networks (GNNs) provokes the question about explainability: Which fraction of the input graph is the most determinant of the prediction? Particularly, parametric explainers prevail in existing approaches because of their stronger capability to decipher the black-box (i.e., the target GNN). In this paper, based on the observation that graphs typically share some joint motif patterns, we propose a novel non-parametric subgraph matching framework, dubbed MatchExplainer, to explore explanatory subgraphs. It couples the target graph with other counterpart instances and identifies the most crucial joint substructure by minimizing the node corresponding-based distance. Moreover, we note that present graph sampling or node-dropping methods usually suffer from the false positive sampling problem. To ameliorate that issue, we design a new augmentation paradigm named MatchDrop. It takes advantage of MatchExplainer to fix the most informative portion of the graph and merely operates graph augmentations on the rest less informative part. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our MatchExplainer by outperforming all parametric baselines with significant margins. Additional results also demonstrate that our MatchDrop is a general scheme to be equipped with GNNs for enhanced performance. ",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) play a crucial role in many applications, such as question answering, but incompleteness is an urgent issue for their broad application. Much research in knowledge graph completion (KGC) has been performed to resolve this issue. The methods of KGC can be classified into two major categories: rule-based reasoning and embedding-based reasoning. The former has high accuracy and good interpretability, but a major challenge is to obtain effective rules on large-scale KGs. The latter has good efficiency and scalability, but it relies heavily on data richness and cannot fully use domain knowledge in the form of logical rules. We propose a novel method that injects rules and learns representations iteratively to take full advantage of rules and embeddings. Specifically, we model the conclusions of rule groundings as 0-1 variables and use a rule confidence regularizer to remove the uncertainty of the conclusions. The proposed approach has the following advantages: 1) It combines the benefits of both rules and knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs) and achieves a good balance between efficiency and scalability. 2) It uses an iterative method to continuously improve KGEs and remove incorrect rule conclusions. Evaluations on two public datasets show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, improving performance by 2.7\\% and 4.3\\% in mean reciprocal rank (MRR). ",

This is established for Mean Square Error (MSE) loss functions with very low learning rate parameters. Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are designed to learn the solutions of differential equations (DE) of arbitrary orders; in PINNs the loss functions are obtained as the residues of the conservative form of the DEs and represent the degree of dissatisfaction of the equations. So there has been an open question whether (a) PINNs also exhibit SB and (b) if so, how does this bias vary across the orders of the DEs. In this work, a series of numerical experiments are conducted on simple sinusoidal functions of varying frequencies, compositions and equation orders to investigate these issues. It is firmly established that under normalized conditions, PINNs do exhibit strong spectral bias, and this increases with the order of the differential equation. ",

    "abstract": "Uncovering rationales behind predictions of graph neural networks (GNNs) has received increasing attention over recent years. Instance-level GNN explanation aims to discover critical input elements, like nodes or edges, that the target GNN relies upon for making predictions. %These identified sub-structures can provide interpretations of GNN's behavior. Though various algorithms are proposed, most of them formalize this task by searching the minimal subgraph which can preserve original predictions. However, an inductive bias is deep-rooted in this framework: several subgraphs can result in the same or similar outputs as the original graphs. Consequently, they have the danger of providing spurious explanations and failing to provide consistent explanations. Applying them to explain weakly-performed GNNs would further amplify these issues. To address this problem, we theoretically examine the predictions of GNNs from the causality perspective. Two typical reasons for spurious explanations are identified: confounding effect of latent variables like distribution shift, and causal factors distinct from the original input. Observing that both confounding effects and diverse causal rationales are encoded in internal representations, \\tianxiang{we propose a new explanation framework with an auxiliary alignment loss, which is theoretically proven to be optimizing a more faithful explanation objective intrinsically. Concretely for this alignment loss, a set of different perspectives are explored: anchor-based alignment, distributional alignment based on Gaussian mixture models, mutual-information-based alignment, etc. A comprehensive study is conducted both on the effectiveness of this new framework in terms of explanation faithfulness/consistency and on the advantages of these variants.

By integrating the hierarchical linguistic tree with the neural network, the proposed method learns and classifies the representation of news documents by capturing their locally sequential and globally recursive structures that are linguistically meaningful. It is the first work offering the hierarchical linguistic tree and the neural network preserving the tree information to our best knowledge. Experimental results based on public real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness, which can outperform state-of-the-art techniques in classifying short and long news documents.

Inspired by the learning and memory mechanism of the brain, this paper proposed a Memory Transformation based Differentiable Neural Computer (MT-DNC) model. MT-DNC incorporates working memory and long-term memory into DNC, and realizes the autonomous transformation of acquired experience between working memory and long-term memory, thereby helping to effectively extract acquired knowledge to improve reasoning ability. Experimental results on bAbI question answering task demonstrated that our proposed method achieves superior performance and faster convergence speed compared to other existing DNN and DNC models. Ablation studies also indicated that the memory transformation from working memory to long-term memory plays essential role in improving the robustness and stability of reasoning.

By initializing parameters with minuscule values, these attention modules are attenuated when the training begins, and the effects of feature interactions and embedding updates progressively grow up to optimum levels under the guidance of the proposed specific regularization approaches Swap-Mix and Hidden-Mix as the training proceeds. Experiments on 25 public tabular datasets show that our ExcelFormer is superior to extremely-tuned GBDTs, which is an unprecedented achievement of neural networks in supervised tabular learning. ",

The former employs the successive convex approximation and FP methods to solve the beamforming vector and hybrid IRS phase shift matrix, while the latter uses the maximum signal-to-leakage-noise ratio method and the criteria of phase alignment and EAR to design them. Simulation results show that the rates harvested by the proposed two methods are slightly lower than that of active IRS with higher power consumption, which are 35 percent higher than those of no IRS and random phase IRS, while passive IRS achieves only about 17 percent rate gain over the latter.

Community detection is one of the significant features of understanding real-world complex systems. In this paper, we propose a High-order node proximity Spectral Clustering on Ratios-of-Eigenvectors (SCOREH+) algorithm for finding communities in complex networks. This algorithm preserves high-order transitivity information of the network affinity matrix. First, we construct the high-order proximity matrix from the original affinity matrix using the Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) and Katz index. Furthermore, we obtain the normalized Laplacian matrix and the normalized leading eigenvectors. The ratios of the leading eigenvectors aid in mitigating the effect of degree heterogeneity. Moreover, we implement a procedure that joins an additional eigenvector (the $(K+1)^{th}$ leading eigenvector) to the spectrum domain for clustering if the network is considered to be a ``weak signal\" graph. Finally, we apply the K-means algorithm to the spectrum domain for acquiring the node labels. We compare our SCOREH+ algorithm with spectral clustering (SC), Spectral Clustering on Ratios-of-Eigenvectors (SCORE), and SCORE+. To demonstrate the high effectiveness of our algorithm, we conducted comparison experiments on $11$ real-world networks and several synthetic networks with noise.

    "abstract": "Encoder as a service is an emerging cloud service. Specifically, a service provider first pre-trains an encoder (i.e., a general-purpose feature extractor) via either supervised learning or self-supervised learning and then deploys it as a cloud service API. A client queries the cloud service API to obtain feature vectors for its training/testing inputs when training/testing its classifier (called downstream classifier). A downstream classifier is vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are testing inputs with carefully crafted perturbation that the downstream classifier misclassifies. Therefore, in safety and security critical applications, a client aims to build a robust downstream classifier and certify its robustness guarantees against adversarial examples. What APIs should the cloud service provide, such that a client can use any certification method to certify the robustness of its downstream classifier against adversarial examples while minimizing the number of queries to the APIs? How can a service provider pre-train an encoder such that clients can build more certifiably robust downstream classifiers? We aim to answer the two questions in this work. For the first question, we show that the cloud service only needs to provide two APIs, which we carefully design, to enable a client to certify the robustness of its downstream classifier with a minimal number of queries to the APIs. For the second question, we show that an encoder pre-trained using a spectral-norm regularization term enables clients to build more robust downstream classifiers. ",

    "title": "How to Allocate your Label Budget? Choosing between Active Learning and  Learning to Reject in Anomaly Detection",
    "abstract": "Anomaly detection attempts at finding examples that deviate from the expected behaviour. Usually, anomaly detection is tackled from an unsupervised perspective because anomalous labels are rare and difficult to acquire. However, the lack of labels makes the anomaly detector have high uncertainty in some regions, which usually results in poor predictive performance or low user trust in the predictions. One can reduce such uncertainty by collecting specific labels using Active Learning (AL), which targets examples close to the detector's decision boundary. Alternatively, one can increase the user trust by allowing the detector to abstain from making highly uncertain predictions, which is called Learning to Reject (LR). One way to do this is by thresholding the detector's uncertainty based on where its performance is low, which requires labels to be evaluated. Although both AL and LR need labels, they work with different types of labels: AL seeks strategic labels, which are evidently biased, while LR requires i.i.d. labels to evaluate the detector's performance and set the rejection threshold. Because one usually has a unique label budget, deciding how to optimally allocate it is challenging. In this paper, we propose a mixed strategy that, given a budget of labels, decides in multiple rounds whether to use the budget to collect AL labels or LR labels. The strategy is based on a reward function that measures the expected gain when allocating the budget to either side. We evaluate our strategy on 18 benchmark datasets and compare it to some baselines. ",

Evaluating a baby's movements is key to understanding possible risks of developmental disorders in their growth. Previous research in psychology has shown that measuring specific movements or gestures such as face touches in babies is essential to analyse how babies understand themselves and their context. This research proposes the first automatic approach that detects face touches from video recordings by tracking infants' movements and gestures. The study uses a multimodal feature fusion approach mixing spatial and temporal features and exploits skeleton tracking information to generate more than 170 aggregated features of hand, face and body. This research proposes data-driven machine learning models for the detection and classification of face touch in infants. We used cross dataset testing to evaluate our proposed models. The models achieved 87.0% accuracy in detecting face touches and 71.4% macro-average accuracy in detecting specific face touch locations with significant improvements over Zero Rule and uniform random chance baselines. Moreover, we show that when we run our model to extract face touch frequencies of a larger dataset, we can predict the development of fine motor skills during the first 5 months after birth. ",

    "abstract": "With the improvements in computing technologies, edge devices in the Internet-of-Things have become more complex. The enabler technology for these complex systems are powerful application core processors with operating system support, such as Linux. While the isolation of applications through the operating system increases the security, the interface to the kernel poses a new threat. Different attack vectors, including fault attacks and memory vulnerabilities, exploit the kernel interface to escalate privileges and take over the system. In this work, we present SFP, a mechanism to protect the execution of system calls against software and fault attacks providing integrity to user-kernel transitions. SFP provides system call flow integrity by a two-step linking approach, which links the system call and its origin to the state of control-flow integrity. A second linking step within the kernel ensures that the right system call is executed in the kernel. Combining both linking steps ensures that only the correct system call is executed at the right location in the program and cannot be skipped. Furthermore, SFP provides dynamic CFI instrumentation and a new CFI checking policy at the edge of the kernel to verify the control-flow state of user programs before entering the kernel. We integrated SFP into FIPAC, a CFI protection scheme exploiting ARM pointer authentication. Our prototype is based on a custom LLVM-based toolchain with an instrumented runtime library combined with a custom Linux kernel to protect system calls. The evaluation of micro- and macrobenchmarks based on SPEC 2017 show an average runtime overhead of 1.9 % and 20.6 %, which is only an increase of 1.8 % over plain control-flow protection. This small impact on the performance shows the efficiency of SFP for protecting all system calls and providing integrity for the user-kernel transitions. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved a lot of success with graph-structured data. However, it is observed that the performance of GNNs does not improve (or even worsen) as the number of layers increases. This effect has known as over-smoothing, which means that the representations of the graph nodes of different classes would become indistinguishable when stacking multiple layers. In this work, we propose a new simple, and efficient method to alleviate the effect of the over-smoothing problem in GNNs by explicitly using relations between node embeddings. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that utilizing node embedding relations makes GNN models such as Graph Attention Network more robust to over-smoothing and achieves better performance with deeper GNNs. Our method can be used in combination with other methods to give the best performance. GNN applications are endless and depend on the user's objective and the type of data that they possess. Solving over-smoothing issues can potentially improve the performance of models on all these tasks. ",

We also present a convergence analysis for some SAV based algorithms, which include our new algorithm without the relaxation step as a special case.

Climate change is at the root of many recent natural hazards while the COVID-19 pandemic is still an active threat. Social vulnerability also refers to resilience, or the ability to recover from such adverse events. To gauge the many aspects of social vulnerability the US Center of Disease Control (CDC) has subdivided social vulnerabilities into distinct themes, such as socioeconomic status, household composition, and others. Knowing a community's social vulnerabilities can help policymakers and responders to recognize risks to community health, prepare for possible hazards, or recover from disasters. In this paper we study social vulnerabilities on the US county level and present research that suggests that there are certain combinations, or patterns, of social vulnerability indicators into which US counties can be grouped. We then present an interactive dashboard that allows analysts to explore these patterns in various ways. We demonstrate our methodology using COVID-19 death rate as the hazard and show that the patterns we identified have high predictive capabilities of the pandemic's local impact. ",

    "abstract": "Local feature matching between images remains a challenging task, especially in the presence of significant appearance variations, e.g., extreme viewpoint changes. In this work, we propose DeepMatcher, a deep Transformer-based network built upon our investigation of local feature matching in detector-free methods. The key insight is that local feature matcher with deep layers can capture more human-intuitive and simpler-to-match features. Based on this, we propose a Slimming Transformer (SlimFormer) dedicated for DeepMatcher, which leverages vector-based attention to model relevance among all keypoints and achieves long-range context aggregation in an efficient and effective manner. A relative position encoding is applied to each SlimFormer so as to explicitly disclose relative distance information, further improving the representation of keypoints. A layer-scale strategy is also employed in each SlimFormer to enable the network to assimilate message exchange from the residual block adaptively, thus allowing it to simulate the human behaviour that humans can acquire different matching cues each time they scan an image pair. To facilitate a better adaption of the SlimFormer, we introduce a Feature Transition Module (FTM) to ensure a smooth transition in feature scopes with different receptive fields. By interleaving the self- and cross-SlimFormer multiple times, DeepMatcher can easily establish pixel-wise dense matches at coarse level. Finally, we perceive the match refinement as a combination of classification and regression problems and design Fine Matches Module to predict confidence and offset concurrently, thereby generating robust and accurate matches. Experimentally, we show that DeepMatcher significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, demonstrating the superior matching capability of DeepMatcher. ",

Instead, we propose a different perspective with a generalized local-property-based sampling method, which preserves (scaled) local \\emph{node} characteristics. Apart from degrees, these local node characteristics we use are the expected (scaled) number of wedges and triangles a node belongs to. Through such a preservation, main complex structural properties are preserved implicitly. We adapt a game-theoretic framework from uncertain graph sampling by including a threshold for faster convergence (at least $4$ times faster empirically) to approximate solutions. Extensive experimental studies on functional climate networks show the effectiveness of this method in preserving macroscopic to mesoscopic and microscopic network structural properties. ",

We describe the changes we made to the E-divisive means algorithm along with their motivation. The main change we adopted was to replace the significance test using randomized permutations with a Student's t-test, as we discovered that the randomized approach did not produce deterministic results, at least not with a reasonable number of iterations. In addition we've made tweaks that allow us to find change points the original algorithm would not, such as two nearby changes. For evaluation, we developed a method to generate real timeseries, but with artificially injected changes in latency. We used these data sets to compare Hunter against two other well known algorithms, PELT and DYNP.

To address the first problem, a supplementary modality is injected into the primary modality by using global optimization and an attention mechanism to select and purify the modality at the input level. To solve the second problem, a dual-direction short connection fusion module is used to optimize the output features of HRFormer, thereby enhancing the detailed representation of objects at the output level. The proposed model, named HRTransNet, first introduces an auxiliary stream for feature extraction of supplementary modality. Then, features are injected into the primary modality at the beginning of each multi-resolution branch. Next, HRFormer is applied to achieve forwarding propagation. Finally, all the output features with different resolutions are aggregated by intra-feature and inter-feature interactive transformers.

Most state-of-the-art methods maximize the similarity between two augmentations of one image based on contrastive learning. By utilizing the consistency of two augmentations, the burden of manual annotations can be freed. Contrastive learning exploits instance-level information to learn robust features. However, the learned information is probably confined to different views of the same instance. In this paper, we attempt to leverage the similarity between two distinct images to boost representation in self-supervised learning. In contrast to instance-level information, the similarity between two distinct images may provide more useful information. Besides, we analyze the relation between similarity loss and feature-level cross-entropy loss. These two losses are essential for most deep learning methods. However, the relation between these two losses is not clear. Similarity loss helps obtain instance-level representation, while feature-level cross-entropy loss helps mine the similarity between two distinct images. We provide theoretical analyses and experiments to show that a suitable combination of these two losses can get state-of-the-art results. ",

Meanwhile, due to excellent performance, heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs) have received more and more attention. However, the existing work mainly focuses on the design of novel GNN models, while ignoring another important issue that also has a large impact on the model performance, namely the missing attributes of some node types. The handcrafted attribute completion requires huge expert experience and domain knowledge. Also, considering the differences in semantic characteristics between nodes, the attribute completion should be fine-grained, i.e., the attribute completion operation should be node-specific. Moreover, to improve the performance of the downstream graph learning task, attribute completion and the training of the heterogeneous GNN should be jointly optimized rather than viewed as two separate processes. To address the above challenges, we propose a differentiable attribute completion framework called AutoAC for automated completion operation search in heterogeneous GNNs. We first propose an expressive completion operation search space, including topology-dependent and topology-independent completion operations. Then, we propose a continuous relaxation schema and further propose a differentiable completion algorithm where the completion operation search is formulated as a bi-level joint optimization problem. To improve the search efficiency, we leverage two optimization techniques: discrete constraints and auxiliary unsupervised graph node clustering. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets reveal that AutoAC outperforms the SOTA handcrafted heterogeneous GNNs and the existing attribute completion method ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the challenging problem of on-demand federated learning (FL) over heterogeneous edge devices with diverse resource constraints. We propose a cost-adjustable FL framework, named AnycostFL, that enables diverse edge devices to efficiently perform local updates under a wide range of efficiency constraints. To this end, we design the model shrinking to support local model training with elastic computation cost, and the gradient compression to allow parameter transmission with dynamic communication overhead. An enhanced parameter aggregation is conducted in an element-wise manner to improve the model performance. Focusing on AnycostFL, we further propose an optimization design to minimize the global training loss with personalized latency and energy constraints. By revealing the theoretical insights of the convergence analysis, personalized training strategies are deduced for different devices to match their locally available resources. Experiment results indicate that, when compared to the state-of-the-art efficient FL algorithms, our learning framework can reduce up to 1.9 times of the training latency and energy consumption for realizing a reasonable global testing accuracy. Moreover, the results also demonstrate that, our approach significantly improves the converged global accuracy. ",

In this work, we present the first large-scale systematic study on the robustness of DNN architecture components under fixed parameter budgets. Through our investigation, we distill 18 actionable robust network design guidelines that empower model developers to gain deep insights.

    "abstract": "Time-to-event models (also known as survival models) are used in medicine and other fields for estimating the probability distribution of the time until a particular event occurs. While providing many advantages over traditional classification models, such as naturally handling censoring, time-to-event models require more parameters and are challenging to learn in settings with limited labeled training data. High censoring rates, common in events with long time horizons, further limit available training data and exacerbate the risk of overfitting. Existing methods, such as proportional hazard or accelerated failure time-based approaches, employ distributional assumptions to reduce parameter size, but they are vulnerable to model misspecification. In this work, we address these challenges with MOTOR, a self-supervised model that leverages temporal structure found in large-scale collections of timestamped, but largely unlabeled events, typical of electronic health record data. MOTOR defines a time-to-event pretraining task that naturally captures the probability distribution of event times, making it well-suited to applications in medicine. After pretraining on 8,192 tasks auto-generated from 2.7M patients (2.4B clinical events), we evaluate the performance of our pretrained model after fine-tuning to unseen time-to-event tasks. MOTOR-derived models improve upon current state-of-the-art C statistic performance by 6.6% and decrease training time (in wall time) by up to 8.2 times. We further improve sample efficiency, with adapted models matching current state-of-the-art performance using 95% less training data. ",

Existing approaches for PNG are mainly based on a two-stage paradigm, which is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a one-stage network for real-time PNG, termed End-to-End Panoptic Narrative Grounding network (EPNG), which directly generates masks for referents. Specifically, we propose two innovative designs, i.e., Locality-Perceptive Attention (LPA) and a bidirectional Semantic Alignment Loss (SAL), to properly handle the many-to-many relationship between textual expressions and visual objects. LPA embeds the local spatial priors into attention modeling, i.e., a pixel may belong to multiple masks at different scales, thereby improving segmentation. To help understand the complex semantic relationships, SAL proposes a bidirectional contrastive objective to regularize the semantic consistency inter modalities. Extensive experiments on the PNG benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Compared to the single-stage baseline, our method achieves a significant improvement of up to 9.4% accuracy. More importantly, our EPNG is 10 times faster than the two-stage model. Meanwhile, the generalization ability of EPNG is also validated by zero-shot experiments on other grounding tasks. ",

This paper presents a robust technique for detection of textual content appearing in video frames. More specifically we target text in cursive script taking Urdu text as a case study. Detection of textual regions in video frames is carried out by fine-tuning object detectors based on deep convolutional neural networks for the specific case of text detection. Since it is common to have videos with caption text in multiple-scripts, cursive text is distinguished from Latin text using a script-identification module.

Although their design has been highly optimized for modern processors, they still consume a considerable amount of energy.

We first build an Algorithm-Based Fault Tolerance protected overclocking technique (ABFT-OC) to enable us to exploit reliable overclocking for key matrix decomposition operations. Then, we design an energy-saving matrix decomposition framework, Bi-directional Slack Reclamation(BSR), that can intelligently combine the capability provided by ABFT-OC and DVFS to maximize energy saving and maintain performance and reliability. Experiments show that BSR is able to save up to 11.7% more energy compared with the current best energy saving optimization approach with no performance degradation and up to 14.1% Energy * Delay^2 reduction. Also, BSR enables the Pareto efficient performance-energy trade-off, which is able to provide up to 1.43x performance improvement without costing extra energy. ",

However, most previous works are evaluated on a few benchmark datasets, such as KITTI datasets, and none of the works provide an in-depth analysis of the generalization performance of monocular depth estimation. In this paper, we deeply investigate the various backbone networks (e.g.CNN and Transformer models) toward the generalization of monocular depth estimation. First, we evaluate state-of-the-art models on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, which have never been seen during network training. Then, we investigate the internal properties of the representations from the intermediate layers of CNN-/Transformer-based models using synthetic texture-shifted datasets. Through extensive experiments, we observe that the Transformers exhibit a strong shape-bias rather than CNNs, which have a strong texture-bias. We also discover that texture-biased models exhibit worse generalization performance for monocular depth estimation than shape-biased models. We demonstrate that similar aspects are observed in real-world driving datasets captured under diverse environments. Lastly, we conduct a dense ablation study with various backbone networks which are utilized in modern strategies. The experiments demonstrate that the intrinsic locality of the CNNs and the self-attention of the Transformers induce texture-bias and shape-bias, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Learning causal relationships between variables is a fundamental task in causal inference and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a popular choice to represent the causal relationships. As one can recover a causal graph only up to its Markov equivalence class from observations, interventions are often used for the recovery task. Interventions are costly in general and it is important to design algorithms that minimize the number of interventions performed. In this work, we study the problem of learning the causal relationships of a subset of edges (target edges) in a graph with as few interventions as possible. Under the assumptions of faithfulness, causal sufficiency, and ideal interventions, we study this problem in two settings: when the underlying ground truth causal graph is known (subset verification) and when it is unknown (subset search). For the subset verification problem, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute a minimum sized interventional set; we further extend these results to bounded size non-atomic interventions and node-dependent interventional costs. For the subset search problem, in the worst case, we show that no algorithm (even with adaptivity or randomization) can achieve an approximation ratio that is asymptotically better than the vertex cover of the target edges when compared with the subset verification number. This result is surprising as there exists a logarithmic approximation algorithm for the search problem when we wish to recover the whole causal graph. To obtain our results, we prove several interesting structural properties of interventional causal graphs that we believe have applications beyond the subset verification/search problems studied here.

    "abstract": "Shadow removal is a fundamental task in computer vision. Despite the success, existing deep learning-based shadow removal methods still produce images with shadow remnants. These shadow remnants typically exist in homogeneous regions with low intensity values, making them untraceable in the existing image-to-image mapping paradigm. We observe from our experiments that shadows mainly degrade object colors at the image structure level (in which humans perceive object outlines filled with continuous colors). Hence, in this paper, we propose to remove shadows at the image structure level. Based on this idea, we propose a novel structure-informed shadow removal network (StructNet) to leverage the image structure information to address the shadow remnant problem. Specifically, StructNet first reconstructs the structure information of the input image without shadows and then uses the restored shadow-free structure prior to guiding the image-level shadow removal. StructNet contains two main novel modules: (1) a mask-guided shadow-free extraction (MSFE) module to extract image structural features in a non-shadow to shadow directional manner, and (2) a multi-scale feature & residual aggregation (MFRA) module to leverage the shadow-free structure information to regularize feature consistency. In addition, we also propose to extend StructNet to exploit multi-level structure information (MStructNet), to further boost the shadow removal performance with minimum computational overheads. Extensive experiments on three shadow removal benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing shadow removal methods, and our StructNet can be integrated with existing methods to boost their performances further.

Specifically, we propose a Support-induced Graph Reasoning (SiGR) module to capture salient query object parts at different semantic levels with a Support-induced GCN. Furthermore, an instance association (IA) module is designed to capture high-order instance context from both support and query instances. By integrating the proposed two modules, SiGCN can learn rich query context representation, and thus being more robust to appearance variations.

However, highly directional and adaptive beamforming in today's mmWave systems have opened new possibilities for self-backhauling.

Although much more cost-effective and flexible, resource allocation and path selection in IAB mmWave networks is a formidable task. To date, prior works have addressed this challenge through a plethora of classic optimization and learning methods, generally optimizing a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) such as throughput, latency, and fairness, and little attention has been paid to the reliability of the KPI. We propose Safehaul, a risk-averse learning-based solution for IAB mmWave networks. In addition to optimizing average performance, Safehaul ensures reliability by minimizing the losses in the tail of the performance distribution. We develop a novel simulator and show via extensive simulations that Safehaul not only reduces the latency by up to 43.2% compared to the benchmarks but also exhibits significantly more reliable performance (e.g., 71.4% less variance in achieved latency).

We present an approach to (1) reconstruct audio samples from a trained ML model and (2) extract intermediate voice feature representations which provide valuable insights into the speakers' biometrics. Therefore, we propose an extension of MI attacks which we call sliding model inversion. Our sliding MI extends standard MI by iteratively inverting overlapping chunks of the audio samples and thereby leveraging the sequential properties of audio data for enhanced inversion performance. We show that one can use the inverted audio data to generate spoofed audio samples to impersonate a speaker, and execute voice-protected commands for highly secured systems on their behalf. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one extending MI attacks to audio data, and our results highlight the security risks resulting from the extraction of the biometric data in that setup.

    "abstract": "Apps on mobile phones manipulate all sorts of data, including sensitive data, leading to privacy-related concerns. Recent regulations like the European GDPR provide rules for the processing of personal and sensitive data, like that no such data may be leaked without the consent of the user. Researchers have proposed sophisticated approaches to track sensitive data within mobile apps, all of which rely on specific lists of sensitive source and sink API methods. The data flow analysis results greatly depend on these lists' quality. Previous approaches either used incomplete hand-written lists that quickly became outdated or relied on machine learning. The latter, however, leads to numerous false positives, as we show. This paper introduces CoDoC, a tool that aims to revive the machine-learning approach to precisely identify privacy-related source and sink API methods. In contrast to previous approaches, CoDoC uses deep learning techniques and combines the source code with the documentation of API methods. Firstly, we propose novel definitions that clarify the concepts of sensitive source and sink methods. Secondly, based on these definitions, we build a new ground truth of Android methods representing sensitive source, sink, and neither (i.e., no source or sink) methods that will be used to train our classifier. We evaluate CoDoC and show that, on our validation dataset, it achieves a precision, recall, and F1 score of 91% in 10-fold cross-validation, outperforming the state-of-the-art SuSi when used on the same dataset. However, similarly to existing tools, we show that in the wild, i.e., with unseen data, CoDoC performs poorly and generates many false positive results. Our findings, together with time-tested results of previous approaches, suggest that machine-learning models for abstract concepts such as privacy fail in practice despite good lab results. ",

In wireless edge networks, the transmission of incorrectly generated content may unnecessarily consume network resources. Thus, a dynamic AIGC service provider (ASP) selection scheme is required to enable users to connect to the most suited ASP, improving the users' satisfaction and quality of generated content. In this article, we first review the AIGC techniques and their applications in wireless networks. We then present the AIGC-as-a-service (AaaS) concept and discuss the challenges in deploying AaaS at the edge networks. Yet, it is essential to have performance metrics to evaluate the accuracy of AIGC services. Thus, we introduce several image-based perceived quality evaluation metrics. Then, we propose a general and effective model to illustrate the relationship between computational resources and user-perceived quality evaluation metrics. To achieve efficient AaaS and maximize the quality of generated content in wireless edge networks, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-enabled algorithm for optimal ASP selection. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can provide a higher quality of generated content to users and achieve fewer crashed tasks by comparing with four benchmarks, i.e., overloading-avoidance, random, round-robin policies, and the upper-bound schemes.

Social media platforms are privileged with emotional content and are leveraged for various purposes like opinion mining, emotion mining, and sentiment analysis. This data analysis is also levered for the prevention of online bullying, suicide prevention, and depression detection among social media users. In this article, we have designed an automatic depression detection of online social media users by analyzing their social media behavior. The designed depression detection classification can be effectively used to mine user's social media interactions and one can determine whether a social media user is suffering from depression or not. The underlying classifier is made using state-of-art technology in emotional artificial intelligence which includes LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) and other machine learning classifiers. The highest accuracy of the classifier is around 70% of LSTM and for SVM the highest accuracy is 81.79%. We trained the classifier on the datasets that are widely used in literature for emotion mining tasks. A confusion matrix of results is also given. ",

Fake reviews are seriously trying to mislead customers and thereby undermine the honesty and authenticity of online shopping environments. So far, various fake review classifiers have been proposed that take into account the actual content of the review. To improve the accuracies of existing fake review classification or detection approaches, we propose to use BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers) model to extract word embeddings from texts (i.e. reviews). Word embeddings are obtained in various basic methods such as SVM (Support vector machine), Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and others. The confusion matrix method was also taken into account to evaluate and graphically represent the results. The results indicate that the SVM classifiers outperform the others in terms of accuracy and f1-score with an accuracy of 87.81%, which is 7.6% higher than the classifier used in the previous study [5].

This is a challenging inverse problem, yet one that if solved could have a significant impact on many engineering applications. The exploitation of such an inverse logic has gained interest in recent years with the advent of widely available cheap but capable MEMS-based sensors. When combined with novel data-driven methods, these sensors may allow for flow reconstruction around immersed structures, benefiting applications such as unmanned airborne/underwater vehicle path planning or control and structural health monitoring of wind turbine blades. In this work, we train deep reversible Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to perform flow sensing (flow reconstruction) around two-dimensional aerodynamic shapes: airfoils. Motivated by recent work, which has shown that GNNs can be powerful alternatives to mesh-based forward physics simulators, we implement a Message-Passing Neural Network to simultaneously reconstruct both the pressure and velocity fields surrounding simulated airfoils based on their surface pressure distributions, whilst additionally gathering useful farfield properties in the form of context vectors. We generate a unique dataset of Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations by simulating random, yet meaningful combinations of input boundary conditions and airfoil shapes. We show that despite the challenges associated with reconstructing the flow around arbitrary airfoil geometries in high Reynolds turbulent inflow conditions, our framework is able to generalize well to unseen cases.

First, we design a coordinated MADRL method with information sharing to intelligently partition resource to slices and manage inter-cell interference. Second, we propose an integrated TL method to transfer the learned DRL policies among different local agents for accelerating the policy deployment. The method is composed of a new domain and task similarity measurement approach and a new knowledge transfer approach, which resolves the problem of from whom to transfer and how to transfer. We evaluated the proposed solution with extensive simulations in a system-level simulator and show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of performance, convergence speed and sample efficiency. Moreover, by applying TL, we achieve an additional gain over 27% higher than the coordinate MADRL approach without TL. ",

First, we design a soft label learning mechanism to reduce the effect of label noise by explicitly measuring the interactions between labels, which is also the basis of the other two mechanisms. Second, the rule-based TSK FS is used as the base model to efficiently model the inference relationship be-tween features and soft labels in a more transparent way than many existing multilabel models. Third, to further improve the performance of multilabel learning, we build a correlation enhancement learning mechanism based on the soft label space and the fuzzy feature space.

An attacker is capable to disable some of the edges of the network with the objective to divide the agents into clusters by emitting jamming signals while, in response, the defender recovers some of the edges by increasing the transmission power for the communication signals. Specifically, we consider repeated games between the attacker and the defender where the optimal strategies for the two players are derived in a rolling horizon fashion based on utility functions that take both the agents' states and the sizes of clusters (known as network effect) into account. The players' actions at each discrete-time step are constrained by their energy for transmissions of the signals, with a less strict constraint for the attacker. Necessary conditions and sufficient conditions of agent consensus are derived, which are influenced by the energy constraints. The number of clusters of agents at infinite time in the face of attacks and recoveries are also characterized. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effects of players' actions on the cluster forming and to illustrate the players' performance for different horizon parameters. ",

Starting from the standard MDP formulation of constructive heuristics, we introduce a generic transformation based on bisimulation quotienting (BQ) in MDPs. This transformation allows to reduce the state space by accounting for the intrinsic symmetries of the CO problem and facilitates the MDP solving. We illustrate our approach on the Traveling Salesman, Capacitated Vehicle Routing and Knapsack Problems. We present a BQ reformulation of these problems and introduce a simple attention-based policy network that we train by imitation of (near) optimal solutions for small instances from a single distribution. We obtain new state-of-the-art generalization results for instances with up to 1000 nodes from synthetic and realistic benchmarks that vary both in size and node distributions. ",

    "abstract": "The goal of constrained multiobjective evolutionary optimization is to obtain a set of well-converged and welldistributed feasible solutions. To complete this goal, there should be a tradeoff among feasibility, diversity, and convergence. However, it is nontrivial to balance these three elements simultaneously by using a single tradeoff model since the importance of each element varies in different evolutionary phases. As an alternative, we adapt different tradeoff models in different phases and propose a novel algorithm called ATM-R. In the infeasible phase, ATM-R takes the tradeoff between diversity and feasibility into account, aiming to move the population toward feasible regions from diverse search directions. In the semi-feasible phase, ATM-R promotes the transition from \"the tradeoff between feasibility and diversity\" to \"the tradeoff between diversity and convergence\", which can facilitate the discovering of enough feasible regions and speed up the search for the feasible Pareto optima in succession. In the feasible phase, the tradeoff between diversity and convergence is considered to attain a set of well-converged and well-distributed feasible solutions. It is worth noting that the merits of reference points are leveraged in ATM-R to accomplish these tradeoff models. Also, in ATM-R, a multiphase mating selection strategy is developed to generate promising solutions beneficial to different evolutionary phases. Systemic experiments on a wide range of benchmark test functions demonstrate that ATM-R is effective and competitive, compared against five state-of-the-art constrained multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithms.

As far as we know there is no publicly available punctuation insertion system for Dutch that functions at a usable level. The model we present here is an extension of the models of Guhr et al.

For every word in the input sequence, the models predicts a punctuation marker that follows the word. We have also extended a multilingual model, for cases where the language is unknown or where code switching applies. When performing the task of segmentation, the application of the best models onto out of domain test data, a sliding window of 200 words of the ASR output stream is sent to the classifier, and segmentation is applied when the system predicts a segmenting punctuation sign with a ratio above threshold.

Then, the text and images are encoded by a Transformer encoder and convolutional neural network, respectively. The two sequences of representations are further fused by an attention layer for the interaction of the two modalities. In this study, the retrieval process is controllable and flexible. The universal visual representation overcomes the lack of large-scale bilingual sentence-image pairs. Our method can be easily applied to text-only tasks without manually annotated multimodal parallel corpora. We apply the proposed method to a wide range of natural language generation and understanding tasks, including neural machine translation, natural language inference, and semantic similarity. Experimental results show that our method is generally effective for different tasks and languages.

We propose a two-stage network slicing framework, which consists of 1) network planning stage in a large timescale to perform slice deployment, edge resource provisioning, and cloud resource provisioning, and 2) network operation stage in a small timescale to perform resource allocation and task dispatching. Particularly, we formulate the network slicing problem as a two-timescale stochastic optimization problem to minimize the network slicing cost. Since the problem is NP-hard due to coupled network planning and network operation stages, we develop a Two timescAle netWork Slicing (TAWS) algorithm by collaboratively integrating reinforcement learning (RL) and optimization methods, which can jointly make network planning and operation decisions. Specifically, by leveraging the timescale separation property of decisions, we decouple the problem into a large-timescale network planning subproblem and a small-timescale network operation subproblem. The former is solved by an RL method, and the latter is solved by an optimization method. Simulation results based on real-world vehicle traffic traces show that the TAWS can effectively reduce the network slicing cost as compared to the benchmark scheme. ",

    "abstract": "Understanding event relationships in videos requires a model to understand the underlying structures of events, i.e., the event type, the associated argument roles, and corresponding entities) along with factual knowledge needed for reasoning. Structural symbolic representation (SSR) based methods directly take event types and associated argument roles/entities as inputs to perform reasoning. However, the state-of-the-art video event-relation prediction system shows the necessity of using continuous feature vectors from input videos; existing methods based solely on SSR inputs fail completely, event when given oracle event types and argument roles. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis to answer the following questions: 1) why SSR-based method failed; 2) how to understand the evaluation setting of video event relation prediction properly; 3) how to uncover the potential of SSR-based methods. We first identify the failure of previous SSR-based video event prediction models to be caused by sub-optimal training settings. Surprisingly, we find that a simple SSR-based model with tuned hyperparameters can actually yield a 20\\% absolute improvement in macro-accuracy over the state-of-the-art model. Then through qualitative and quantitative analysis, we show how evaluation that takes only video as inputs is currently unfeasible, and the reliance on oracle event information to obtain an accurate evaluation. Based on these findings, we propose to further contextualize the SSR-based model to an Event-Sequence Model and equip it with more factual knowledge through a simple yet effective way of reformulating external visual commonsense knowledge bases into an event-relation prediction pretraining dataset. The resultant new state-of-the-art model eventually establishes a 25\\% Macro-accuracy performance boost. ",

    "abstract": "The mobile communication enabled by cellular networks is the one of the main foundations of our modern society. Optimizing the performance of cellular networks and providing massive connectivity with improved coverage and user experience has a considerable social and economic impact on our daily life. This performance relies heavily on the configuration of the network parameters. However, with the massive increase in both the size and complexity of cellular networks, network management, especially parameter configuration, is becoming complicated. The current practice, which relies largely on experts' prior knowledge, is not adequate and will require lots of domain experts and high maintenance costs. In this work, we propose a learning-based framework for handover parameter configuration. The key challenge, in this case, is to tackle the complicated dependencies between neighboring cells and jointly optimize the whole network. Our framework addresses this challenge in two ways. First, we introduce a novel approach to imitate how the network responds to different network states and parameter values, called auto-grouping graph convolutional network (AG-GCN). During the parameter configuration stage, instead of solving the global optimization problem, we design a local multi-objective optimization strategy where each cell considers several local performance metrics to balance its own performance and its neighbors. We evaluate our proposed algorithm via a simulator constructed using real network data. We demonstrate that the handover parameters our model can find, achieve better average network throughput compared to those recommended by experts as well as alternative baselines, which can bring better network quality and stability. It has the potential to massively reduce costs arising from human expert intervention and maintenance. ",

The ASM has free parameters which, in practice, are chosen to be some generally acceptable values based on intuition. However, we note that the heuristically chosen values often result in un-physical predictions by the ASM. In this work, we propose a neural network based on the ASM which tunes those parameters automatically by learning from sparse data from road sensors. We refer to it as the adaptive smoothing neural network (ASNN). We also propose a modified ASNN (MASNN), which makes it a strong learner by using ensemble averaging. The ASNN and MASNN are trained and tested two real-world datasets. Our experiments reveal that the ASNN and the MASNN outperform the conventional ASM. ",

For example, they typically look at single and sometimes simplified tasks, and do not discuss in-depth data heterogeneity and inconsistency that is common in real-world problems or their implication on the development of their methods. Also, few prior work has focused on the healthcare domain. In this work, we describe an industry project that developed text mining and NLP solutions to mine millions of heterogeneous, multilingual procurement documents in the healthcare sector. We extract structured procurement contract data that is used to power a platform for dynamically assessing supplier risks. Our work makes unique contributions in a number of ways. First, we deal with highly heterogeneous, multilingual data and we document our approach to tackle these challenges. This is mainly based on a method that effectively uses domain knowledge and generalises to multiple text mining and NLP tasks and languages. Second, applying this method to mine millions of procurement documents, we develop the first structured procurement contract database that will help facilitate the tendering process.

    "abstract": "Convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers have their own advantages and both have been widely used for dense prediction in multi-task learning (MTL). Most of the current studies on MTL solely rely on CNN or Transformer. In this work, we present a novel MTL model by combining both merits of deformable CNN and query-based Transformer for multi-task learning of dense prediction. Our method, named DeMT, is based on a simple and effective encoder-decoder architecture (i.e., deformable mixer encoder and task-aware transformer decoder). First, the deformable mixer encoder contains two types of operators: the channel-aware mixing operator leveraged to allow communication among different channels ($i.e.,$ efficient channel location mixing), and the spatial-aware deformable operator with deformable convolution applied to efficiently sample more informative spatial locations (i.e., deformed features). Second, the task-aware transformer decoder consists of the task interaction block and task query block. The former is applied to capture task interaction features via self-attention. The latter leverages the deformed features and task-interacted features to generate the corresponding task-specific feature through a query-based Transformer for corresponding task predictions. Extensive experiments on two dense image prediction datasets, NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context, demonstrate that our model uses fewer GFLOPs and significantly outperforms current Transformer- and CNN-based competitive models on a variety of metrics.

To solve this problem, we propose a new transformer-based method named Parallel Reasoning Network(PR-Net), which constructs two independent predictors for instance-level localization and relation-level understanding. The former predictor concentrates on instance-level localization by perceiving instances' extremity regions. The latter broadens the scope of relation region to reach a better relation-level semantic understanding.

In this work we propose SCENE, a methodology to encode diverse traffic scenes in heterogeneous graphs and to reason about these graphs using a heterogeneous Graph Neural Network encoder and task-specific decoders. The heterogeneous graphs, whose structures are defined by an ontology, consist of different nodes with type-specific node features and different relations with type-specific edge features. In order to exploit all the information given by these graphs, we propose to use cascaded layers of graph convolution. The result is an encoding of the scene. Task-specific decoders can be applied to predict desired attributes of the scene. Extensive evaluation on two diverse binary node classification tasks show the main strength of this methodology: despite being generic, it even manages to outperform task-specific baselines. The further application of our methodology to the task of node classification in various knowledge graphs shows its transferability to other domains. ",

This research proposes a way to overcome this barrier by bypassing feature engineering in the deep learning pipeline and using raw packet data as input. We introduce a feature engineering-less machine learning (ML) process to perform malware detection on IoT devices. Our proposed model, \"Feature engineering-less-ML (FEL-ML),\" is a lighter-weight detection algorithm that expends no extra computations on \"engineered\" features. It effectively accelerates the low-powered IoT edge. It is trained on unprocessed byte-streams of packets. Aside from providing better results, it is quicker than traditional feature-based methods.

Users may express complex queries using programs but it requires expertise. Keyword search is accessible to a larger audience but limits the types of queries supported. An interesting approach is learned discovery systems which find tables given natural language questions. Unfortunately, these systems require a training dataset for each table collection. And because collecting training data is expensive, this limits their adoption. In this paper, we introduce a self-supervised approach to assemble training datasets and train learned discovery systems without human intervention. It requires addressing several challenges, including the design of self-supervised strategies for data discovery, table representation strategies to feed to the models, and relevance models that work well with the synthetically generated questions. We combine all the above contributions into a system, S2LD, that solves the problem end to end. The evaluation results demonstrate the new techniques outperform state-of-the-art approaches on wellknown benchmarks.

For (i), we treat unmasked pixels as sparse voxels of 3D point clouds and use sparse convolution to encode. This is the first use of sparse convolution for 2D masked modeling. For (ii), we develop a hierarchical decoder to reconstruct images from multi-scale encoded features. Our method called Sparse masKed modeling (SparK) is general: it can be used directly on any convolutional model without backbone modifications. We validate it on both classical (ResNet) and modern (ConvNeXt) models: on three downstream tasks, it surpasses both state-of-the-art contrastive learning and transformer-based masked modeling by similarly large margins (around +1.0%). Improvements on object detection and instance segmentation are more substantial (up to +3.5%), verifying the strong transferability of features learned. We also find its favorable scaling behavior by observing more gains on larger models. All this evidence reveals a promising future of generative pre-training on convnets.

    "abstract": "Holographic cloud probes provide unprecedented information on cloud particle density, size and position. Each laser shot captures particles within a large volume, where images can be computationally refocused to determine particle size and shape. However, processing these holograms, either with standard methods or with machine learning (ML) models, requires considerable computational resources, time and occasional human intervention. ML models are trained on simulated holograms obtained from the physical model of the probe since real holograms have no absolute truth labels. Using another processing method to produce labels would be subject to errors that the ML model would subsequently inherit. Models perform well on real holograms only when image corruption is performed on the simulated images during training, thereby mimicking non-ideal conditions in the actual probe (Schreck et. al, 2022). Optimizing image corruption requires a cumbersome manual labeling effort. Here we demonstrate the application of the neural style translation approach (Gatys et. al, 2016) to the simulated holograms. With a pre-trained convolutional neural network (VGG-19), the simulated holograms are ``stylized'' to resemble the real ones obtained from the probe, while at the same time preserving the simulated image ``content'' (e.g. the particle locations and sizes). Two image similarity metrics concur that the stylized images are more like real holograms than the synthetic ones. With an ML model trained to predict particle locations and shapes on the stylized data sets, we observed comparable performance on both simulated and real holograms, obviating the need to perform manual labeling. The described approach is not specific to hologram images and could be applied in other domains for capturing noise and imperfections in observational instruments to make simulated data more like real world observations.

    "abstract": "This paper provides new observations on the Lov\\'{a}sz $\\theta$-function of graphs. These include a simple closed-form expression of that function for all strongly regular graphs, together with upper and lower bounds on that function for all regular graphs. These bounds are expressed in terms of the second-largest and smallest eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the regular graph, together with sufficient conditions for equalities (the upper bound is due to Lov\\'{a}sz, followed by a new sufficient condition for its tightness). These results are shown to be useful in many ways, leading to the determination of the exact value of the Shannon capacity of various graphs, eigenvalue inequalities, and bounds on the clique and chromatic numbers of graphs. Since the Lov\\'{a}sz $\\theta$-function factorizes for the strong product of graphs, the results are also particularly useful for parameters of strong products or strong powers of graphs. Bounds on the smallest and second-largest eigenvalues of strong products of regular graphs are consequently derived, expressed as functions of the Lov\\'{a}sz $\\theta$-function (or the smallest eigenvalue) of each factor. The resulting lower bound on the second-largest eigenvalue of a $k$-fold strong power of a regular graph is compared to the Alon--Boppana bound; under a certain condition, the new bound is superior in its exponential growth rate (in $k$). Lower bounds on the chromatic number of strong products of graphs are expressed in terms of the order and the Lov\\'{a}sz $\\theta$-function of each factor. The utility of these bounds is exemplified, leading in some cases to an exact determination of the chromatic numbers of strong products or strong powers of graphs.

However, metastatic LNs are time-consuming and challenging to detect even for professional radiologists due to their small sizes, high sparsity, and ambiguity in appearance. It is desired to leverage recent development in deep learning to automatically detect metastatic LNs. Besides a two-stage detection network, we here introduce an additional branch to leverage information about LN stations, an important reference for radiologists during metastatic LN diagnosis, as supplementary information for metastatic LN detection. The branch targets to solve a closely related task on the LN station level, i.e., classifying whether an LN station contains metastatic LN or not, so as to learn representations for LN stations. Considering that a metastatic LN station is expected to significantly affect the nearby ones, a GCN-based structure is adopted by the branch to model the relationship among different LN stations. At the classification stage of metastatic LN detection, the above learned LN station features, as well as the features reflecting the distance between the LN candidate and the LN stations, are integrated with the LN features. We validate our method on a dataset containing 114 intravenous contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) images of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients and show that it outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on the mFROC, maxF1, and AUC scores,respectively.

    "abstract": "In this paper we discuss a new method for detecting leukemia in microscopic blood smear images using deep neural networks to diagnose leukemia early in blood. leukemia is considered one of the most dangerous mortality causes for a human being, the traditional process of diagnosis of leukemia in blood is complex, costly, and time-consuming, so patients could not receive medical treatment on time; Computer vision classification technique using deep learning can overcome the problems of traditional analysis of blood smears, our system for leukemia detection provides 97.3 % accuracy in classifying samples as cancerous or normal samples by taking a shot of blood smear and passing it as an input to the system that will check whether it contains cancer or not. In case of containing cancer cells, then the hematological expert passes the sample to a more complex device such as flow cytometry to generate complete information about the progress of cancer in the blood.

    "title": "Machine-Learning Prediction of the Computed Band Gaps of Double  Perovskite Materials",
    "abstract": "Prediction of the electronic structure of functional materials is essential for the engineering of new devices. Conventional electronic structure prediction methods based on density functional theory (DFT) suffer from not only high computational cost, but also limited accuracy arising from the approximations of the exchange-correlation functional. Surrogate methods based on machine learning have garnered much attention as a viable alternative to bypass these limitations, especially in the prediction of solid-state band gaps, which motivated this research study. Herein, we construct a random forest regression model for band gaps of double perovskite materials, using a dataset of 1306 band gaps computed with the GLLBSC (Gritsenko, van Leeuwen, van Lenthe, and Baerends solid correlation) functional. Among the 20 physical features employed, we find that the bulk modulus, superconductivity temperature, and cation electronegativity exhibit the highest importance scores, consistent with the physics of the underlying electronic structure. Using the top 10 features, a model accuracy of 85.6% with a root mean square error of 0.64 eV is obtained, comparable to previous studies. Our results are significant in the sense that they attest to the potential of machine learning regressions for the rapid screening of promising candidate functional materials. ",

    "abstract": "The sixth generation (6G) wireless systems are envisioned to enable the paradigm shift from \"connected things\" to \"connected intelligence\", featured by ultra high density, large-scale, dynamic heterogeneity, diversified functional requirements and machine learning capabilities, which leads to a growing need for highly efficient intelligent algorithms. The classic optimization-based algorithms usually require highly precise mathematical model of data links and suffer from poor performance with high computational cost in realistic 6G applications. Based on domain knowledge (e.g., optimization models and theoretical tools), machine learning (ML) stands out as a promising and viable methodology for many complex large-scale optimization problems in 6G, due to its superior performance, generalizability, computational efficiency and robustness. In this paper, we systematically review the most representative \"learning to optimize\" techniques in diverse domains of 6G wireless networks by identifying the inherent feature of the underlying optimization problem and investigating the specifically designed ML frameworks from the perspective of optimization. In particular, we will cover algorithm unrolling, learning to branch-and-bound, graph neural network for structured optimization, deep reinforcement learning for stochastic optimization, end-to-end learning for semantic optimization, as well as federated learning for distributed optimization, for solving challenging large-scale optimization problems arising from various important wireless applications. Through the in-depth discussion, we shed light on the excellent performance of ML-based optimization algorithms with respect to the classical methods, and provide insightful guidance to develop advanced ML techniques in 6G networks.

Meanwhile, research on corporate social responsibility is still not aligned with the recent data-driven strategies, and little public data are available. This paper aims to describe CSRCZ, a newly created dataset based on disclosure reports from the websites of 1000 companies that operate in Czech Republic. Each company was analyzed based on three main parameters: company size, company industry, and company initiatives. We describe the content of the dataset as well as its potential use for future research. We believe that CSRCZ has implications for further research, since it is the first publicly available dataset of its kind. ",

    "abstract": "Computational discovery of ideal lead compounds is a critical process for modern drug discovery. It comprises multiple stages: hit screening, molecular property prediction, and molecule optimization. Current efforts are disparate, involving the establishment of models for each stage, followed by multi-stage multi-model integration. However, this is non-ideal, as clumsy integration of incompatible models increases research overheads, and may even reduce success rates in drug discovery. Facilitating compatibilities requires establishing inherent model consistencies across lead discovery stages. Towards that effect, we propose an open deep graph learning (DGL) based pipeline: generative adversarial feature subspace enhancement (GAFSE), which first unifies the modeling of these stages into one learning framework. GAFSE also offers standardized modular design and streamlined interfaces for future expansions and community support. GAFSE combines adversarial/generative learning, graph attention network, graph reconstruction network, and optimizes the classification/regression loss, adversarial/generative loss, and reconstruction loss simultaneously. Convergence analysis theoretically guarantees model generalization performance. Exhaustive benchmarking demonstrates that the GAFSE pipeline achieves excellent performance across almost all lead discovery stages, while also providing valuable model interpretability. Hence, we believe this tool will enhance the efficiency and productivity of drug discovery researchers. ",

    "abstract": "In this manuscript, we propose a novel deep learning (DL)-based framework intended for obtaining short latency in real-time electroencephalogram-based epileptic seizure detection using multiscale 3D convolutional neural networks. We pioneer converting seizure detection task from traditional binary classification of samples from ictal and interictal periods to probabilistic classification of samples from interictal, ictal, and crossing periods. We introduce a crossing period from seizure-oriented EEG recording and propose a labelling rule using soft-label for samples from the crossing period to build a probabilistic classification task. A novel multiscale short-time Fourier transform feature extraction method and 3D convolution neural network architecture are proposed to accurately capture predictive probabilities of samples. Furthermore, we also propose rectified weighting strategy to enhance predictive probabilities, and accumulative decision-making rule to achieve short detection latency. We implement leave-one-seizure-out cross validation on two prevalent datasets -- CHB-MIT scalp EEG dataset and SWEC-ETHZ intracranial EEG dataset. Eventually, the proposed algorithm achieved 94 out of 99 seizures detected during the crossing period, averaged 14.84% rectified predictive ictal probability (RPIP) errors of crossing samples, 2.3 s detection latency, 0.32/h false detection rate on CHB-MIT dataset, meanwhile 84 out of 89 detected seizures, 16.17% RPIP errors, 4.7 s detection latency, and 0.75/h FDR are achieved on SWEC-ETHZ dataset. The obtained detection latencies are at least 50% faster than state-of-the-art results reported in previous studies. ",

    "abstract": "Sleep behaviour and in-bed movements contain rich information on the neurophysiological health of people, and have a direct link to the general well-being and quality of life. Standard clinical practices rely on polysomnography for sleep assessment; however, it is intrusive, performed in unfamiliar environments and requires trained personnel. Progress has been made on less invasive sensor technologies, such as actigraphy, but clinical validation raises concerns over their reliability and precision. Additionally, the field lacks a widely acceptable algorithm, with proposed approaches ranging from raw signal or feature thresholding to data-hungry classification models, many of which are unfamiliar to medical staff. This paper proposes an online Bayesian probabilistic framework for objective (in)activity detection and segmentation based on clinically meaningful joint kinematics, measured by a custom-made wearable sensor. Intuitive three-dimensional visualisations of kinematic timeseries were accomplished through dimension reduction based preprocessing, offering out-of-the-box framework explainability potentially useful for clinical monitoring and diagnosis. The proposed framework attained up to 99.2\\% $F_1$-score and 0.96 Pearson's correlation coefficient in, respectively, the posture change detection and inactivity segmentation tasks. The work paves the way for a reliable home-based analysis of movements during sleep which would serve patient-centred longitudinal care plans. ",

We qualify our results as either minimax optimal or instance optimal: the former hold for the set of distribution pairs with prescribed Hellinger divergence and total variation distance, whereas the latter hold for specific distribution pairs. For the sample complexity of simple hypothesis testing under pure LDP constraints, we establish instance-optimal bounds for distributions with binary support; minimax-optimal bounds for general distributions; and (approximately) instance-optimal, computationally efficient algorithms for general distributions. When both privacy and communication constraints are present, we develop instance-optimal, computationally efficient algorithms that achieve the minimum possible sample complexity (up to universal constants). Our results on instance-optimal algorithms hinge on identifying the extreme points of the joint range set $\\mathcal A$ of two distributions $p$ and $q$, defined as $\\mathcal A := \\{(\\mathbf T p, \\mathbf T q) | \\mathbf T \\in \\mathcal C\\}$, where $\\mathcal C$ is the set of channels characterizing the constraints.
