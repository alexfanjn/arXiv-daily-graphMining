    "abstract": "Time series are the primary data type used to record dynamic system measurements and generated in great volume by both physical sensors and online processes (virtual sensors). Time series analytics is therefore crucial to unlocking the wealth of information implicit in available data. With the recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs), there has been a surge in GNN-based approaches for time series analysis. Approaches can explicitly model inter-temporal and inter-variable relationships, which traditional and other deep neural network-based methods struggle to do. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of graph neural networks for time series analysis (GNN4TS), encompassing four fundamental dimensions: Forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and imputation. Our aim is to guide designers and practitioners to understand, build applications, and advance research of GNN4TS. At first, we provide a comprehensive task-oriented taxonomy of GNN4TS. Then, we present and discuss representative research works and, finally, discuss mainstream applications of GNN4TS. A comprehensive discussion of potential future research directions completes the survey. This survey, for the first time, brings together a vast array of knowledge on GNN-based time series research, highlighting both the foundations, practical applications, and opportunities of graph neural networks for time series analysis.

    "title": "Dynamic Graph Attention for Anomaly Detection in Heterogeneous Sensor  Networks",
    "abstract": "In the era of digital transformation, systems monitored by the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs) generate large amounts of Multivariate Time Series (MTS) data through heterogeneous sensor networks. While this data facilitates condition monitoring and anomaly detection, the increasing complexity and interdependencies within the sensor network pose significant challenges for anomaly detection. Despite progress in this field, much of the focus has been on point anomalies and contextual anomalies, with lesser attention paid to collective anomalies. A less addressed but common variant of collective anomalies is when the abnormal collective behavior is caused by shifts in interrelationships within the system. This can be due to abnormal environmental conditions like overheating, improper operational settings resulting from cyber-physical attacks, or system-level faults. To address these challenges, this paper proposes DyGATAD (Dynamic Graph Attention for Anomaly Detection), a graph-based anomaly detection framework that leverages the attention mechanism to construct a continuous graph representation of multivariate time series by inferring dynamic edges between time series. DyGATAD incorporates an operating condition-aware reconstruction combined with a topology-based anomaly score, thereby enhancing the detection ability of relationship shifts. We evaluate the performance of DyGATAD using both a synthetic dataset with controlled varying fault severity levels and an industrial-scale multiphase flow facility benchmark featuring various fault types with different detection difficulties. Our proposed approach demonstrated superior performance in collective anomaly detection for sensor networks, showing particular strength in early-stage fault detection, even in the case of faults with minimal severity.

We present an ensemble active learning pipeline to train a stance classifier. Our novelty lies in the involvement of Iranian women in an active role as annotators in building this AI system. Our annotators not only provide labels, but they also suggest valuable keywords for more meaningful corpus creation as well as provide short example documents for a guided sampling step. Our analyses indicate that Mahsa Amini's death triggered polarized Persian language discourse where both fractions of negative and positive tweets toward gender equality increased. The increase in positive tweets was slightly greater than the increase in negative tweets. We also observe that with respect to account creation time, between the state-aligned Twitter accounts and pro-protest Twitter accounts, pro-protest accounts are more similar to baseline Persian Twitter activity.

We validate the proposed approach on near- and far-OOD datasets and compare it to a recently proposed, 3D-enabled approach using Latent Transformer Models (LTMs). Not only does the proposed LDM-based approach achieve statistically significant better performance, it also shows less sensitivity to the underlying latent representation, more favourable memory scaling, and produces better spatial anomaly maps.

    "abstract": "Abstraction-based techniques are an attractive approach for synthesizing correct-by-construction controllers to satisfy high-level temporal requirements. A main bottleneck for successful application of these techniques is the memory requirement, both during controller synthesis and in controller deployment. We propose memory-efficient methods for mitigating the high memory demands of the abstraction-based techniques using neural network representations. To perform synthesis for reach-avoid specifications, we propose an on-the-fly algorithm that relies on compressed neural network representations of the forward and backward dynamics of the system. In contrast to usual applications of neural representations, our technique maintains soundness of the end-to-end process. To ensure this, we correct the output of the trained neural network such that the corrected output representations are sound with respect to the finite abstraction. For deployment, we provide a novel training algorithm to find a neural network representation of the synthesized controller and experimentally show that the controller can be correctly represented as a combination of a neural network and a look-up table that requires a substantially smaller memory. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach significantly reduces the memory requirements of abstraction-based methods. For the selected benchmarks, our approach reduces the memory requirements respectively for the synthesis and deployment by a factor of $1.31\\times 10^5$ and $7.13\\times 10^3$ on average, and up to $7.54\\times 10^5$ and $3.18\\times 10^4$. Although this reduction is at the cost of increased off-line computations to train the neural networks, all the steps of our approach are parallelizable and can be implemented on machines with higher number of processing units to reduce the required computational time.

In this work, we generate synthetic forestry images that satisfy certain phenotypic attributes, viz. canopy greenness.

Our objective is to develop a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesize forestry images conditioned on this continuous attribute, i.e., greenness of vegetation, over a specific region of interest. The training data is based on the automated digital camera imagery provided by the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and processed by the PhenoCam Network. The synthetic images generated by our method are also used to predict another phenotypic attribute, viz., redness of plants. The Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) index is utilized to assess the quality of the synthetic images. The greenness and redness indices of the generated synthetic images are compared against that of the original images using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in order to evaluate their accuracy and integrity. Moreover, the generalizability and scalability of our proposed GAN model is determined by effectively transforming it to generate synthetic images for other forest sites and vegetation types. ",

    "abstract": "The robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) against adversarial attacks has been studied extensively in hopes of both better understanding how deep learning models converge and in order to ensure the security of these models in safety-critical applications. Adversarial training is one approach to strengthening DNNs against adversarial attacks, and has been shown to offer a means for doing so at the cost of applying computationally expensive training methods to the entire model. To better understand these attacks and facilitate more efficient adversarial training, in this paper we develop a novel theoretical framework that investigates how the adversarial robustness of a subnetwork contributes to the robustness of the entire network. To do so we first introduce the concept of semirobustness, which is a measure of the adversarial robustness of a subnetwork. Building on this concept, we then provide a theoretical analysis to show that if a subnetwork is semirobust and there is a sufficient dependency between it and each subsequent layer in the network, then the remaining layers are also guaranteed to be robust. We validate these findings empirically across multiple DNN architectures, datasets, and adversarial attacks. Experiments show the ability of a robust subnetwork to promote full-network robustness, and investigate the layer-wise dependencies required for this full-network robustness to be achieved. ",

With the rising demand for reliable machine learning and uncertainty quantification, there is a need for pretrained models that not only provide embeddings but also transferable uncertainty estimates.

Besides the transferability of the representations, it also measures the zero-shot transferability of the uncertainty estimate using a novel metric. We apply URL to evaluate eleven uncertainty quantifiers that are pretrained on ImageNet and transferred to eight downstream datasets. We find that approaches that focus on the uncertainty of the representation itself or estimate the prediction risk directly outperform those that are based on the probabilities of upstream classes. Yet, achieving transferable uncertainty quantification remains an open challenge. Our findings indicate that it is not necessarily in conflict with traditional representation learning goals.

In cases where additional sensors are not available or LOS is not possible, these technologies may not be the best option. This paper proposes a novel method that employs channel state information (CSI) from WiFi signals affected by robotic arm motion. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify four different activities of a Franka Emika robotic arm. The implemented method seeks to accurately predict robot motion even in scenarios in which the robot is obscured by obstacles, without relying on any attached or internal sensors. ",

However, in addition to the anticipated revolutionary changes to our technology and society, the difficulty of distinguishing LLM-generated texts (AI-text) from human-generated texts poses new challenges of misuse and fairness, such as fake content generation, plagiarism, and false accusation of innocent writers. While existing works show that current AI-text detectors are not robust to LLM-based paraphrasing, this paper aims to bridge this gap by proposing a new framework called RADAR, which jointly trains a Robust AI-text Detector via Adversarial leaRning. RADAR is based on adversarial training of a paraphraser and a detector. The paraphraser's goal is to generate realistic contents to evade AI-text detection. RADAR uses the feedback from the detector to update the paraphraser, and vice versa. Evaluated with 8 different LLMs (Pythia, Dolly 2.0, Palmyra, Camel, GPT-J, Dolly 1.0, LLaMA, and Vicuna) across 4 datasets, experimental results show that RADAR significantly outperforms existing AI-text detection methods, especially when paraphrasing is in place. We also identify the strong transferability of RADAR from instruction-tuned LLMs to other LLMs, and evaluate the improved capability of RADAR via GPT-3.5. ",

    "abstract": "Background: As improving code review (CR) effectiveness is a priority for many software development organizations, projects have deployed CR analytics platforms to identify potential improvement areas. The number of issues identified, which is a crucial metric to measure CR effectiveness, can be misleading if all issues are placed in the same bin. Therefore, a finer-grained classification of issues identified during CRs can provide actionable insights to improve CR effectiveness. Although a recent work by Fregnan et al. proposed automated models to classify CR-induced changes, we have noticed two potential improvement areas -- i) classifying comments that do not induce changes and ii) using deep neural networks (DNN) in conjunction with code context to improve performances. Aims: This study aims to develop an automated CR comment classifier that leverages DNN models to achieve a more reliable performance than Fregnan et al. Method: Using a manually labeled dataset of 1,828 CR comments, we trained and evaluated supervised learning-based DNN models leveraging code context, comment text, and a set of code metrics to classify CR comments into one of the five high-level categories proposed by Turzo and Bosu. Results: Based on our 10-fold cross-validation-based evaluations of multiple combinations of tokenization approaches, we found a model using CodeBERT achieving the best accuracy of 59.3%. Our approach outperforms Fregnan et al.'s approach by achieving 18.7% higher accuracy. Conclusion: Besides facilitating improved CR analytics, our proposed model can be useful for developers in prioritizing code review feedback and selecting reviewers. ",

    "abstract": "The real-time crash likelihood prediction model is an essential component of the proactive traffic safety management system. Over the years, numerous studies have attempted to construct a crash likelihood prediction model in order to enhance traffic safety, but mostly on freeways. In the majority of the existing studies, researchers have primarily employed a deep learning-based framework to identify crash potential. Lately, Transformer has emerged as a potential deep neural network that fundamentally operates through attention-based mechanisms. Transformer has several functional benefits over extant deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), etc. Firstly, Transformer can readily handle long-term dependencies in a data sequence. Secondly, Transformer can parallelly process all elements in a data sequence during training. Finally, Transformer does not have the vanishing gradient issue. Realizing the immense possibility of Transformer, this paper proposes inTersection-Transformer (inTformer), a time-embedded attention-based Transformer model that can effectively predict intersection crash likelihood in real-time. The proposed model was evaluated using connected vehicle data extracted from INRIX's Signal Analytics Platform. The data was parallelly formatted and stacked at different timesteps to develop nine inTformer models. The best inTformer model achieved a sensitivity of 73%. This model was also compared to earlier studies on crash likelihood prediction at intersections and with several established deep learning models trained on the same connected vehicle dataset. In every scenario, this inTformer outperformed the benchmark models confirming the viability of the proposed inTformer architecture. ",

One such task is Computer-Assisted Coding (CAC) which has improved significantly in recent years, thanks to advances in machine learning technologies. Yet simply predicting a set of final codes for a patient encounter is insufficient as CAC systems are required to provide supporting textual evidence to justify the billing codes. A model able to produce accurate and reliable supporting evidence for each code would be a tremendous benefit. However, a human annotated code evidence corpus is extremely difficult to create because it requires specialized knowledge. In this paper, we introduce MDACE, the first publicly available code evidence dataset, which is built on a subset of the MIMIC-III clinical records. The dataset -- annotated by professional medical coders -- consists of 302 Inpatient charts with 3,934 evidence spans and 52 Profee charts with 5,563 evidence spans. We implemented several evidence extraction methods based on the EffectiveCAN model (Liu et al., 2021) to establish baseline performance on this dataset. MDACE can be used to evaluate code evidence extraction methods for CAC systems, as well as the accuracy and interpretability of deep learning models for multi-label classification. We believe that the release of MDACE will greatly improve the understanding and application of deep learning technologies for medical coding and document classification. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, work has gone into developing deep interpretable methods for image classification that clearly attributes a model's output to specific features of the data. One such of these methods is the prototypical part network (ProtoPNet), which attempts to classify images based on meaningful parts of the input. While this method results in interpretable classifications, this method often learns to classify from spurious or inconsistent parts of the image. Hoping to remedy this, we take inspiration from the recent developments in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune these prototypes. By collecting human annotations of prototypes quality via a 1-5 scale on the CUB-200-2011 dataset, we construct a reward model that learns to identify non-spurious prototypes. In place of a full RL update, we propose the reweighted, reselected, and retrained prototypical part network (R3-ProtoPNet), which adds an additional three steps to the ProtoPNet training loop. The first two steps are reward-based reweighting and reselection, which align prototypes with human feedback. The final step is retraining to realign the model's features with the updated prototypes. We find that R3-ProtoPNet improves the overall consistency and meaningfulness of the prototypes, but lower the test predictive accuracy when used independently. When multiple R3-ProtoPNets are incorporated into an ensemble, we find an increase in test predictive performance while maintaining interpretability. ",

    "abstract": "Our paper investigates the use of discourse embedding techniques to develop a community recommendation system that focuses on mental health support groups on social media. Social media platforms provide a means for users to anonymously connect with communities that cater to their specific interests. However, with the vast number of online communities available, users may face difficulties in identifying relevant groups to address their mental health concerns. To address this challenge, we explore the integration of discourse information from various subreddit communities using embedding techniques to develop an effective recommendation system. Our approach involves the use of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to enhance the performance of the recommendation system. Our findings indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the use of each technique separately and provides interpretability in the recommendation process. ",

    "abstract": "In visible-infrared video person re-identification (re-ID), extracting features not affected by complex scenes (such as modality, camera views, pedestrian pose, background, etc.) changes, and mining and utilizing motion information are the keys to solving cross-modal pedestrian identity matching. To this end, the paper proposes a new visible-infrared video person re-ID method from a novel perspective, i.e., adversarial self-attack defense and spatial-temporal relation mining. In this work, the changes of views, posture, background and modal discrepancy are considered as the main factors that cause the perturbations of person identity features. Such interference information contained in the training samples is used as an adversarial perturbation. It performs adversarial attacks on the re-ID model during the training to make the model more robust to these unfavorable factors. The attack from the adversarial perturbation is introduced by activating the interference information contained in the input samples without generating adversarial samples, and it can be thus called adversarial self-attack. This design allows adversarial attack and defense to be integrated into one framework. This paper further proposes a spatial-temporal information-guided feature representation network to use the information in video sequences. The network cannot only extract the information contained in the video-frame sequences but also use the relation of the local information in space to guide the network to extract more robust features. The proposed method exhibits compelling performance on large-scale cross-modality video datasets. The source code of the proposed method will be released at https://github.com/lhf12278/xxx. ",

In PINNs, the NN acts as the solution approximator for the PDE while the PDE acts as the prior knowledge to guide the NN training, leading to the desired generalization performance of the NN when facing the limited availability of training data. However, training PINNs is a non-trivial task largely due to the complexity of the loss composed of both NN and physical law parts. In this work, we propose a new PINN training framework based on the multi-task optimization (MTO) paradigm. Under this framework, multiple auxiliary tasks are created and solved together with the given (main) task, where the useful knowledge from solving one task is transferred in an adaptive mode to assist in solving some other tasks, aiming to uplift the performance of solving the main task. We implement the proposed framework and apply it to train the PINN for addressing the traffic density prediction problem. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed training framework leads to significant performance improvement in comparison to the traditional way of training the PINN. ",

However, edges are important and fundamental factors in the following segmentation task. Due to the high visual similarity between camouflaged targets and the surroundings, edge prior predicted in early stage usually introduces erroneous foreground-background and contaminates features for segmentation. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Edge-aware Mirror Network (EAMNet), which models edge detection and camouflaged object segmentation as a cross refinement process. More specifically, EAMNet has a two-branch architecture, where a segmentation-induced edge aggregation module and an edge-induced integrity aggregation module are designed to cross-guide the segmentation branch and edge detection branch. A guided-residual channel attention module which leverages the residual connection and gated convolution finally better extracts structural details from low-level features. Quantitative and qualitative experiment results show that EAMNet outperforms existing cutting-edge baselines on three widely used COD datasets.

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) are information networks with multiple types of nodes and edges. The concept of meta-path, i.e., a sequence of entity types and relation types connecting two entities, is proposed to provide the meta-level explainable semantics for various HIN tasks. Traditionally, meta-paths are primarily used for schema-simple HINs, e.g., bibliographic networks with only a few entity types, where meta-paths are often enumerated with domain knowledge. However, the adoption of meta-paths for schema-complex HINs, such as knowledge bases (KBs) with hundreds of entity and relation types, has been limited due to the computational complexity associated with meta-path enumeration. Additionally, effectively assessing meta-paths requires enumerating relevant path instances, which adds further complexity to the meta-path learning process. To address these challenges, we propose SchemaWalk, an inductive meta-path learning framework for schema-complex HINs. We represent meta-paths with schema-level representations to support the learning of the scores of meta-paths for varying relations, mitigating the need of exhaustive path instance enumeration for each relation. Further, we design a reinforcement-learning based path-finding agent, which directly navigates the network schema (i.e., schema graph) to learn policies for establishing meta-paths with high coverage and confidence for multiple relations. Extensive experiments on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm. ",

However, limited understanding of human behavior in this context often leads to suboptimal resource utilization. In this study, we analyzed the participation behavior of 2,956 members with a time span of 6 years in a community sports organization. Our study reveals that, at the population level, the participation frequency in activities adheres to a power-law distribution. To understand the underlying mechanisms driving crowd participation, we introduce a novel behavioral model called HFBI (Habit-Formation and Behavioral Inertia), demonstrating a robust fit to the observed power-law distribution. The habit formation mechanism indicates that individuals who are more engaged are more likely to maintain participation, while the behavioral inertia mechanism suggests that individuals' willingness to participate in activities diminishes with their absences from activities. At the individual level, our analysis reveals a burst-quiet participation pattern, with bursts often commencing with incentive activities. We also find a power-law distribution in the intervals between individual participations. Our research offers valuable insights into the complex dynamics of human participation in community sports activity and provides a theoretical foundation to inform intervention design. Furthermore, the flexibility of our model enables its application to other data exhibiting power-law properties, broadening its potential impact beyond the realm of community sports. ",

    "abstract": "In mapping enterprise applications, data mapping remains a fundamental part of integration development, but its time consuming. An increasing number of applications lack naming standards, and nested field structures further add complexity for the integration developers. Once the mapping is done, data transformation is the next challenge for the users since each application expects data to be in a certain format. Also, while building integration flow, developers need to understand the format of the source and target data field and come up with transformation program that can change data from source to target format. The problem of automatic generation of a transformation program through program synthesis paradigm from some specifications has been studied since the early days of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Programming by Example (PBE) is one such kind of technique that targets automatic inferencing of a computer program to accomplish a format or string conversion task from user-provided input and output samples. To learn the correct intent, a diverse set of samples from the user is required. However, there is a possibility that the user fails to provide a diverse set of samples. This can lead to multiple intents or ambiguity in the input and output samples. Hence, PBE systems can get confused in generating the correct intent program. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network based ambiguity prediction model, which analyzes the input-output strings and maps them to a different set of properties responsible for multiple intent. Users can analyze these properties and accordingly can provide new samples or modify existing samples which can help in building a better PBE system for mapping enterprise applications. ",

Particularly, a cognitive radio inspired uplink NOMA communication scenario is considered, where one primary user is allocated one dedicated resource block, while M secondary users compete with each other to be opportunistically served by using the same resource block of the primary user. Two novel schemes are proposed for the considered scenario, namely hybrid SIC with PA (HSIC-PA) scheme and fixed SIC with PA (FSIC-PA) scheme. Both schemes can ensure that the secondary users are served without degrading the transmission reliability of the primary user compared to conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based schemes. Rigorous analytical results are presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed two schemes. It is shown that both schemes can avoid outage probability error floors without any constraints on users' target rates in the high SNR regime. Furthermore, it is shown that the diversity gain achieved by the HSIC-PA scheme is M, while that of the FISC-PA scheme is only 1. Numerical results are provided to verify the developed analytical results and also demonstrate the superior performance achieved by the proposed schemes by comparing with the existing HSIC without PA (HSIC-NPA) scheme. The presented simulation results also show that HSIC-PA scheme performs the best among the three schemes, which indicates the importance of the combination of HSIC and PA for improving transmission robustness.

Current methods either struggle with perceptual performance or suffer from significant distortion. Recently, the emerging diffusion model achieves state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, and its denoising mechanism demonstrates great potential for image denoising. However, stimulating diffusion models for image denoising is not straightforward and requires solving several critical problems. On the one hand, the input inconsistency hinders the connection of diffusion models and image denoising. On the other hand, the content inconsistency between the generated image and the desired denoised image introduces additional distortion. To tackle these problems, we present a novel strategy called Diffusion Model for Image Denoising (DMID) by understanding and rethinking the diffusion model from a denoising perspective. Our DMID strategy includes an adaptive embedding method that embeds the noisy image into a pre-trained diffusion model, and an adaptive ensembling method that reduces distortion in the denoised image. Our DMID strategy achieves state-of-the-art performance on all distortion-based and perceptual metrics, for both Gaussian and real-world image denoising. ",

Our approach tackles the challenges in market equilibrium characterization arising from: (a) integer and network constraints on the dynamic flow of trips in sharing limited edge capacity; (b) heterogeneous and private preferences of strategic agents. We provide sufficient conditions on the network topology and agents' preferences that ensure the existence and polynomial-time computation of market equilibrium.

    "abstract": "Code review is considered a key process in the software industry for minimizing bugs and improving code quality. Inspection of review process effectiveness and continuous improvement can boost development productivity. Such inspection is a time-consuming and human-bias-prone task. We propose a semi-supervised learning based system ReviewRanker which is aimed at assigning each code review a confidence score which is expected to resonate with the quality of the review. Our proposed method is trained based on simple and and well defined labels provided by developers. The labeling task requires little to no effort from the developers and has an indirect relation to the end goal (assignment of review confidence score). ReviewRanker is expected to improve industry-wide code review quality inspection through reducing human bias and effort required for such task. The system has the potential of minimizing the back-and-forth cycle existing in the development and review process.

    "abstract": "The display devices like HDR10 televisions are increasingly prevalent in our daily life for visualizing high dynamic range (HDR) images. But the majority of media images on the internet remain in 8-bit standard dynamic range (SDR) format. Therefore, converting SDR images to HDR ones by inverse tone mapping (ITM) is crucial to unlock the full potential of abundant media images. However, existing ITM methods are usually developed with complex network architectures requiring huge computational costs. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Improved Residual Network (IRNet) by enhancing the power of popular residual block for efficient ITM. Specifically, we propose a new Improved Residual Block (IRB) to extract and fuse multi-layer features for fine-grained HDR image reconstruction. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our IRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the ITM and joint SR-ITM tasks.

    "abstract": "Set representation has become ubiquitous in deep learning for modeling the inductive bias of neural networks that are insensitive to the input order. DeepSets is the most widely used neural network architecture for set representation. It involves embedding each set element into a latent space with dimension $L$, followed by a sum pooling to obtain a whole-set embedding, and finally mapping the whole-set embedding to the output. In this work, we investigate the impact of the dimension $L$ on the expressive power of DeepSets. Previous analyses either oversimplified high-dimensional features to be one-dimensional features or were limited to analytic activations, thereby diverging from practical use or resulting in $L$ that grows exponentially with the set size $N$ and feature dimension $D$. To investigate the minimal value of $L$ that achieves sufficient expressive power, we present two set-element embedding layers: (a) linear + power activation (LP) and (b) linear + exponential activations (LE). We demonstrate that $L$ being poly$(N, D)$ is sufficient for set representation using both embedding layers. We also provide a lower bound of $L$ for the LP embedding layer. Furthermore, we extend our results to permutation-equivariant set functions and the complex field. ",

    "abstract": "Internet privacy is increasingly important on the modern Internet. Users are looking to control the trail of data that they leave behind on the systems that they interact with. Multi-Party Relay (MPR) architectures lower the traditional barriers to adoption of privacy enhancing technologies on the Internet. MPRs are unique from legacy architectures in that they are able to offer privacy guarantees without paying significant performance penalties. Apple's iCloud Private Relay is a recently deployed MPR service, creating the potential for widespread consumer adoption of the architecture. However, many current Internet-scale systems are designed based on assumptions that may no longer hold for users of privacy enhancing systems like Private Relay. There are inherent tensions between systems that rely on data about users -- estimated location of a user based on their IP address, for example -- and the trend towards a more private Internet. This work studies a core function that is widely used to control network and application behavior, IP geolocation, in the context of iCloud Private Relay usage. We study the location accuracy of popular IP geolocation services compared against the published location dataset that Apple publicly releases to explicitly aid in geolocating PR users. We characterize geolocation service performance across a number of dimensions, including different countries, IP version, infrastructure provider, and time. Our findings lead us to conclude that existing approaches to IP geolocation (e.g., frequently updated databases) perform inadequately for users of the MPR architecture. For example, we find median location errors >1,000 miles in some countries for IPv4 addresses using IP2Location. Our findings lead us to conclude that new, privacy-focused, techniques for inferring user location may be required as privacy becomes a default user expectation on the Internet. ",

    "abstract": "Robotic navigation in unknown, cluttered environments with limited sensing capabilities poses significant challenges in robotics. Local trajectory optimization methods, such as Model Predictive Path Intergal (MPPI), are a promising solution to this challenge. However, global guidance is required to ensure effective navigation, especially when encountering challenging environmental conditions or navigating beyond the planning horizon. This study presents the GP-MPPI, an online learning-based control strategy that integrates MPPI with a local perception model based on Sparse Gaussian Process (SGP). The key idea is to leverage the learning capability of SGP to construct a variance (uncertainty) surface, which enables the robot to learn about the navigable space surrounding it, identify a set of suggested subgoals, and ultimately recommend the optimal subgoal that minimizes a predefined cost function to the local MPPI planner. Afterward, MPPI computes the optimal control sequence that satisfies the robot and collision avoidance constraints. Such an approach eliminates the necessity of a global map of the environment or an offline training process. We validate the efficiency and robustness of our proposed control strategy through both simulated and real-world experiments of 2D autonomous navigation tasks in complex unknown environments, demonstrating its superiority in guiding the robot safely towards its desired goal while avoiding obstacles and escaping entrapment in local minima.

In addition, we provide a generalized Marini formula for the primal solution that determines a discrete primal solution in terms of a given discrete dual solution. We benchmark all these concepts via the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi model. This leads to an adaptive algorithm that yields a (quasi-optimal) linear convergence rate. ",

Due to its visual straightforwardness, the method has been one of the most popular explainable AI (XAI) methods for diagnosing CNNs. Through our formative study (S1), however, we captured ML engineers' ambivalent perspective about the local explanation as a valuable and indispensable envision in building CNNs versus the process that exhausts them due to the heuristic nature of detecting vulnerability. Moreover, steering the CNNs based on the vulnerability learned from the diagnosis seemed highly challenging. To mitigate the gap, we designed DeepFuse, the first interactive design that realizes the direct feedback loop between a user and CNNs in diagnosing and revising CNN's vulnerability using local explanations. DeepFuse helps CNN engineers to systemically search \"unreasonable\" local explanations and annotate the new boundaries for those identified as unreasonable in a labor-efficient manner. Next, it steers the model based on the given annotation such that the model doesn't introduce similar mistakes. We conducted a two-day study (S2) with 12 experienced CNN engineers. Using DeepFuse, participants made a more accurate and \"reasonable\" model than the current state-of-the-art. Also, participants found the way DeepFuse guides case-based reasoning can practically improve their current practice. We provide implications for design that explain how future HCI-driven design can move our practice forward to make XAI-driven insights more actionable. ",

    "abstract": "The load planning problem is a critical challenge in service network design for parcel carriers: it decides how many trailers (or loads) to assign for dispatch over time between pairs of terminals. Another key challenge is to determine a flow plan, which specifies how parcel volumes are assigned to planned loads. This paper considers the Dynamic Load Planning Problem (DLPP) that considers both flow and load planning challenges jointly to adjust loads and flows as the demand forecast changes over time before the day of operations. The paper aims at developing a decision-support tool to inform planners making these decisions at terminals across the network. The paper formulates the DLPP as a MIP and shows that it admits a large number of symmetries in a network where each commodity can be routed through primary and alternate paths. As a result, an optimization solver may return fundamentally different solutions to closely related problems, confusing planners and reducing trust in optimization. To remedy this limitation, the paper proposes a Goal-Directed Optimization that eliminates those symmetries by generating optimal solutions staying close to a reference plan. The paper also proposes an optimization proxy to address the computational challenges of the optimization models. The proxy combines a machine learning model and a feasibility restoration model and finds solutions that satisfy real-time constraints imposed by planners-in-the-loop. An extensive computational study on industrial instances shows that the optimization proxy is around 10 times faster than the commercial solver in obtaining the same quality solutions and orders of magnitude faster for generating solutions that are consistent with each other. The proposed approach also demonstrates the benefits of the DLPP for load consolidation, and the significant savings obtained from combining machine learning and optimization. ",

Due to this stringent requirement, deploying adversarial patches for vision transformers in the physical world becomes impractical, unlike their effectiveness on CNNs. This paper proposes a novel method for generating an adversarial patch (G-Patch) that overcomes the alignment constraint, allowing the patch to launch a targeted attack at any position within the field of view. Specifically, instead of directly optimizing the patch using gradients, we employ a GAN-like structure to generate the adversarial patch. Our experiments show the effectiveness of the adversarial patch in achieving universal attacks on vision transformers, both in digital and physical-world scenarios. Additionally, further analysis reveals that the generated adversarial patch exhibits robustness to brightness restriction, color transfer, and random noise. Real-world attack experiments validate the effectiveness of the G-Patch to launch robust attacks even under some very challenging conditions. ",

We study this potential in the context of a type of American Competitive Debate, called Policy Debate, which already has a large scale dataset targeting it called DebateSum. We significantly improve upon DebateSum by introducing 53180 new examples, as well as further useful metadata for every example, to the dataset. We leverage the txtai semantic search and knowledge graph toolchain to produce and contribute 9 semantic knowledge graphs built on this dataset. We create a unique method for evaluating which knowledge graphs are better in the context of producing policy debate cases. A demo which automatically generates debate cases, along with all other code and the Knowledge Graphs, are open-sourced and made available to the public here: https://github.com/Hellisotherpeople/DebateKG ",

    "abstract": "2D RGB images and 3D LIDAR point clouds provide complementary knowledge for the perception system of autonomous vehicles. Several 2D and 3D fusion methods have been explored for the LIDAR semantic segmentation task, but they suffer from different problems. 2D-to-3D fusion methods require strictly paired data during inference, which may not be available in real-world scenarios, while 3D-to-2D fusion methods cannot explicitly make full use of the 2D information. Therefore, we propose a Bidirectional Fusion Network with Cross-Modality Knowledge Distillation (CMDFusion) in this work. Our method has two contributions. First, our bidirectional fusion scheme explicitly and implicitly enhances the 3D feature via 2D-to-3D fusion and 3D-to-2D fusion, respectively, which surpasses either one of the single fusion schemes. Second, we distillate the 2D knowledge from a 2D network (Camera branch) to a 3D network (2D knowledge branch) so that the 3D network can generate 2D information even for those points not in the FOV (field of view) of the camera. In this way, RGB images are not required during inference anymore since the 2D knowledge branch provides 2D information according to the 3D LIDAR input. We show that our CMDFusion achieves the best performance among all fusion-based methods on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets. The code will be released at https://github.com/Jun-CEN/CMDFusion. ",

The core idea is to learn a mapping to transform the unknown distribution of training (normal) data to a known target distribution. Crucially, the target distribution should be sufficiently simple, compact, and informative. The simplicity is to ensure that we can sample from the distribution easily, the compactness is to ensure that the decision boundary between normal data and abnormal data is clear and reliable, and the informativeness is to ensure that the transformed data preserve the important information of the original data. Therefore, we propose to use truncated Gaussian, uniform in hypersphere, uniform on hypersphere, or uniform between hyperspheres, as the target distribution. We then minimize the distance between the transformed data distribution and the target distribution while keeping the reconstruction error for the original data small enough. Comparative studies on multiple benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our methods in comparison to baselines. ",

Previous methods often generate AE with no or very limited transferability; that is, they easily overfit to the particular architecture and feature representation of the source, white-box model and the generated AE barely work for target, black-box models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance AE transferability using Gradient Norm Penalty (GNP). It drives the loss function optimization procedure to converge to a flat region of local optima in the loss landscape. By attacking 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models and 6 advanced defense methods, we empirically show that GNP is very effective in generating AE with high transferability. We also demonstrate that it is very flexible in that it can be easily integrated with other gradient based methods for stronger transfer-based attacks. ",

Multispectral imaging is an important task relevant to image processing and computer vision, even more, since the development of the RGBT sensor. While the visible image sees color and suffers from noise, haze, and clouds, the NIR channel captures a clearer picture and it is significantly required by applications such as dehazing or object detection. The proposed approach fuses these two aligned channels by training a Convolutional-Neural-Network (CNN) by a Self-Supervised-Learning (SSL) on a single example. For each such pair, RGB and IR, the network is trained for seconds to deduce the final fusion. The SSL is based on Sturcture-of-Similarity (SSIM) loss combined with Edge-Preservation (EP) loss. The labels for the SSL are the input channels themselves. This fusion preserves the relevant detail of each spectral channel while not based on a heavy training process. In the experiments section, the proposed approach achieves better qualitative and quantitative multispectral fusion results with respect to other recent methods, that are not based on large dataset training.

Two novel schemes are proposed to improve the feature extraction and utilization ability of CA-CentripetalNet, which are vertical-horizontal corner pooling and bounding constrained center attention. The former is designed to realize the comprehensive utilization of marginal features and internal features. The latter is designed to enforce the backbone to pay attention to internal features, which is only used during the training rather than during the detection. Experimental results indicate that the CA-CentripetalNet achieves better performance with the 86.63% mAP (mean Average Precision) with less memory consumption at a reasonable speed than the existing deep learning based methods, especially in case of small-scale hardhats and non-worn-hardhats.

    "abstract": "Recent vision-only perception models for autonomous driving achieved promising results by encoding multi-view image features into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space. A critical step and the main bottleneck of these methods is transforming image features into the BEV coordinate frame. This paper focuses on leveraging geometry information, such as depth, to model such feature transformation. Existing works rely on non-parametric depth distribution modeling leading to significant memory consumption, or ignore the geometry information to address this problem. In contrast, we propose to use parametric depth distribution modeling for feature transformation. We first lift the 2D image features to the 3D space defined for the ego vehicle via a predicted parametric depth distribution for each pixel in each view. Then, we aggregate the 3D feature volume based on the 3D space occupancy derived from depth to the BEV frame. Finally, we use the transformed features for downstream tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Existing semantic segmentation methods do also suffer from an hallucination problem as they do not take visibility information into account. This hallucination can be particularly problematic for subsequent modules such as control and planning. To mitigate the issue, our method provides depth uncertainty and reliable visibility-aware estimations. We further leverage our parametric depth modeling to present a novel visibility-aware evaluation metric that, when taken into account, can mitigate the hallucination problem. Extensive experiments on object detection and semantic segmentation on the nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods on both tasks. ",

Coflow is a relatively new network abstraction used to characterize communication patterns in data centers. Both flow-level scheduling and coflow-level scheduling problems are examined, with the key distinction being the scheduling granularity. The proposed algorithm effectively determines the scheduling order of coflows by employing the primal-dual method. When considering workload sizes and weights that are dependent on the network topology in the input instances, our proposed algorithm for the flow-level scheduling problem achieves an approximation ratio of $O(\\chi)$ where $\\chi$ is the coflow number of the longest path in the directed acyclic graph (DAG). Additionally, when taking into account workload sizes that are topology-dependent, the algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $O(R\\chi)$, where $R$ represents the ratio of maximum weight to minimum weight. For the coflow-level scheduling problem, the proposed algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $O(m\\chi)$, where $m$ is the number of network cores, when considering workload sizes and weights that are topology-dependent. Moreover, when considering workload sizes that are topology-dependent, the algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $O(Rm\\chi)$. In the coflows of multi-stage job scheduling problem, the proposed algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $O(\\chi)$. Although our theoretical results are based on a limited set of input instances, experimental findings show that the results for general input instances outperform the theoretical results, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed algorithm.

Box detection assessment revealed that CBAM achieved the best outcome (F1 score of 77%) compared to coordinate attention (F1 score of 71%) and YOLOv7/bottleneck transformer (both F1 scores around 66%). Mask evaluation showed CBAM again leading with an F1 score of 73%, whereas coordinate attention and YOLOv7 had comparable performances (around F1 score of 68%/69%) and bottleneck transformer lagged behind at F1 score of 56%.

Specifically, we propose a mask modeling strategy that randomly masks a specific modality of some tokens to enforce the interaction between tokens from different modalities interacting proactively. To mitigate network oscillations resulting from the masking strategy and further amplify its positive effect, we then theoretically propose an orthogonal high-rank loss to regularize the attention matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play training augmentation techniques can significantly boost state-of-the-art one-stream and twostream trackers to a large extent in terms of both tracking precision and success rate. Our new perspective and findings will potentially bring insights to the field of leveraging powerful pre-trained ViTs to model cross-modal data. The code will be publicly available. ",

Conventional attention-based and graph-based models capture the global context to a large extent, however, these are computationally expensive. Moreover, the existing approaches are limited to only learning the pairwise semantic relation between any two points on the image. In this paper, we present Latent Graph Attention (LGA) a computationally inexpensive (linear to the number of nodes) and stable, modular framework for incorporating the global context in the existing architectures, especially empowering small-scale architectures to give performance closer to large size architectures, thus making the light-weight architectures more useful for edge devices with lower compute power and lower energy needs. LGA propagates information spatially using a network of locally connected graphs, thereby facilitating to construct a semantically coherent relation between any two spatially distant points that also takes into account the influence of the intermediate pixels. Moreover, the depth of the graph network can be used to adapt the extent of contextual spread to the target dataset, thereby being able to explicitly control the added computational cost. To enhance the learning mechanism of LGA, we also introduce a novel contrastive loss term that helps our LGA module to couple well with the original architecture at the expense of minimal additional computational load. We show that incorporating LGA improves the performance on three challenging applications, namely transparent object segmentation, image restoration for dehazing and optical flow estimation. ",

With the recent introduction of diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, we can access far more powerful image generation techniques, enabling new possibilities. In our work, we propose using this new class of models to perform style transfer while enabling deformable style transfer, an elusive capability in previous models.

However, most of the existing methods focus on modeling WSIs with homogeneous graphs (e.g., with homogeneous node type). Despite their successes, these works are incapable of mining the complex structural relations between biological entities (e.g., the diverse interaction among different cell types) in the WSI. We propose a novel heterogeneous graph-based framework to leverage the inter-relationships among different types of nuclei for WSI analysis. Specifically, we formulate the WSI as a heterogeneous graph with \"nucleus-type\" attribute to each node and a semantic similarity attribute to each edge. We then present a new heterogeneous-graph edge attribute transformer (HEAT) to take advantage of the edge and node heterogeneity during massage aggregating. Further, we design a new pseudo-label-based semantic-consistent pooling mechanism to obtain graph-level features, which can mitigate the over-parameterization issue of conventional cluster-based pooling. Additionally, observing the limitations of existing association-based localization methods, we propose a causal-driven approach attributing the contribution of each node to improve the interpretability of our framework.

    "abstract": "We revisit the binary adversarial wiretap channel (AWTC) of type II in which an active adversary can read a fraction $r$ and flip a fraction $p$ of codeword bits. The semantic-secrecy capacity of the AWTC II is partially known, where the best-known lower bound is non-constructive, proven via a random coding argument that uses a large number (that is exponential in blocklength $n$) of random bits to seed the random code. In this paper, we establish a new derandomization result in which we match the best-known lower bound of $1-H_2(p)-r$ where $H_2(\\cdot)$ is the binary entropy function via a random code that uses a small seed of only $O(n^2)$ bits. Our random code construction is a novel application of pseudolinear codes -- a class of non-linear codes that have $k$-wise independent codewords when picked at random where $k$ is a design parameter. As the key technical tool in our analysis, we provide a soft-covering lemma in the flavor of Goldfeld, Cuff and Permuter (Trans. Inf. Theory 2016) that holds for random codes with $k$-wise independent codewords. ",

    "abstract": "Fire is considered one of the most serious threats to human lives which results in a high probability of fatalities. Those severe consequences stem from the heavy smoke emitted from a fire that mostly restricts the visibility of escaping victims and rescuing squad. In such hazardous circumstances, the use of a vision-based human detection system is able to improve the ability to save more lives. To this end, a thermal and infrared imaging fusion strategy based on multiple cameras for human detection in low-visibility scenarios caused by smoke is proposed in this paper. By processing with multiple cameras, vital information can be gathered to generate more useful features for human detection. Firstly, the cameras are calibrated using a Light Heating Chessboard. Afterward, the features extracted from the input images are merged prior to being passed through a lightweight deep neural network to perform the human detection task. The experiments conducted on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano computer demonstrated that the proposed method can process with reasonable speed and can achieve favorable performance with a mAP@0.5 of 95%. ",

    "abstract": "Learning multi-agent system dynamics has been extensively studied for various real-world applications, such as molecular dynamics in biology. Most of the existing models are built to learn single system dynamics from observed historical data and predict the future trajectory. In practice, however, we might observe multiple systems that are generated across different environments, which differ in latent exogenous factors such as temperature and gravity. One simple solution is to learn multiple environment-specific models, but it fails to exploit the potential commonalities among the dynamics across environments and offers poor prediction results where per-environment data is sparse or limited. Here, we present GG-ODE (Generalized Graph Ordinary Differential Equations), a machine learning framework for learning continuous multi-agent system dynamics across environments. Our model learns system dynamics using neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) parameterized by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the continuous interaction among agents. We achieve the model generalization by assuming the dynamics across different environments are governed by common physics laws that can be captured via learning a shared ODE function. The distinct latent exogenous factors learned for each environment are incorporated into the ODE function to account for their differences. To improve model performance, we additionally design two regularization losses to (1) enforce the orthogonality between the learned initial states and exogenous factors via mutual information minimization; and (2) reduce the temporal variance of learned exogenous factors within the same system via contrastive learning. Experiments over various physical simulations show that our model can accurately predict system dynamics, especially in the long range, and can generalize well to new systems with few observations.

However, the edge computers will have small data storage but we need to store the collected audio samples for a long time in order to update existing models or develop a novel method. Therefore, we should consider an approach for efficient storage management methods while preserving high-fidelity audio. A hardware-perspective approach, such as using a low-resolution microphone, is an intuitive way to reduce file size but is not recommended because it fundamentally cuts off high-frequency components. On the other hand, a computational file compression approach that encodes collected high-resolution audio into a compact code should be recommended because it also provides a corresponding decoding method. Motivated by this, we propose a way of simple yet effective pre-trained autoencoder-based data compression method. The pre-trained autoencoder is trained for the purpose of audio super-resolution so it can be utilized to encode or decode any arbitrary sampling rate. Moreover, it will reduce the communication cost for data transmission from the edge to the central server. Via the comparative experiments, we confirm that the zero-shot audio compression and decompression highly preserve anomaly detection performance while enhancing storage and transmission efficiency.

    "abstract": "We propose a physics informed, neural network-based elasto-viscoplasticity (NN-EVP) constitutive modeling framework for predicting the flow response in metals as a function of underlying grain size. The developed NN-EVP algorithm is based on input convex neural networks as a means to strictly enforce thermodynamic consistency, while allowing high expressivity towards model discovery from limited data. It utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning tools within PyTorch's high-performance library providing a flexible tool for data-driven, automated constitutive modeling. To test the performance of the framework, we generate synthetic stress-strain curves using a power law-based model with phenomenological hardening at small strains and test the trained model for strain amplitudes beyond the training data. Next, experimentally measured flow responses obtained from uniaxial deformations are used to train the framework under large plastic deformations. Ultimately, the Hall-Petch relationship corresponding to grain size strengthening is discovered by training flow response as a function of grain size, also leading to efficient extrapolation. The present work demonstrates a successful integration of neural networks into elasto-viscoplastic constitutive laws, providing a robust automated framework for constitutive model discovery that can efficiently generalize, while also providing insights into predictions of flow response and grain size-property relationships in metals and metallic alloys under large plastic deformations.

In addition, progressive self-bootstrapping is introduced to minimize the negative impact of supervision from noisy labels.

At the same time, recent works in joint visual language models such as CLIP provide ways to specify natural language descriptions of image classes but typically focus on providing single descriptions for each class. In this work, we demonstrate that an alternative approach, arguably more akin to our understanding of multiple ``visual features'' per class, can also provide compelling performance in the robust few-shot learning setting. In particular, we automatically enumerate multiple visual descriptions of each class -- via a large language model (LLM) -- then use a vision-image model to translate these descriptions to a set of multiple visual features of each image; we finally use sparse logistic regression to select a relevant subset of these features to classify each image. This both provides an ``intuitive'' set of relevant features for each class, and in the few-shot learning setting, outperforms standard approaches such as linear probing. When combined with finetuning, we also show that the method is able to outperform existing state-of-the-art finetuning approaches on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance. ",

    "abstract": "In e-commerce search, personalized retrieval is a crucial technique for improving user shopping experience. Recent works in this domain have achieved significant improvements by the representation learning paradigm, e.g., embedding-based retrieval (EBR) and collaborative filtering (CF). EBR methods do not sufficiently exploit the useful collaborative signal and are difficult to learn the representations of long-tail item well. Graph-based CF methods improve personalization by modeling collaborative signal within the user click graph. However, existing Graph-based methods ignore user's multiple behaviours, such as click/purchase and the relevance constraint between user behaviours and items.In this paper, we propose a Graph Contrastive Learning with Multi-Objective (GCL-MO) collaborative filtering model, which solves the problems of weak relevance and incomplete personalization in e-commerce search. Specifically, GCL-MO builds a homogeneous graph of items and then optimizes a multi-objective function of personalization and relevance. Moreover, we propose a modified contrastive loss for multi-objectives graph learning, which avoids the mutual suppression among positive samples and thus improves the generalization and robustness of long-tail item representations. These learned item embeddings are then used for personalized retrieval by constructing an efficient offline-to-online inverted table. GCL-MO outperforms the online collaborative filtering baseline in both offline/online experimental metrics and shows a significant improvement in the online A/B testing of Taobao search. ",

In this paper, we introduce a novel adversarial defense scheme named ScoreOpt, which optimizes adversarial samples at test-time, towards original clean data in the direction guided by score-based priors.

Benefitting from the information passing paradigm of SNNs, the multiplications of activations and weights can be replaced by additions, which are more energy-efficient. However, its ``Hard Reset\" mechanism for the firing activity would ignore the difference among membrane potentials when the membrane potential is above the firing threshold, causing information loss. Meanwhile, quantifying the membrane potential to 0/1 spikes at the firing instants will inevitably introduce the quantization error thus bringing about information loss too. To address these problems, we propose to use the ``Soft Reset\" mechanism for the supervised training-based SNNs, which will drive the membrane potential to a dynamic reset potential according to its magnitude, and Membrane Potential Rectifier (MPR) to reduce the quantization error via redistributing the membrane potential to a range close to the spikes. Results show that the SNNs with the ``Soft Reset\" mechanism and MPR outperform their vanilla counterparts on both static and dynamic datasets. ",

This problem is challenging because the behavior of a node is coupled to all the other nodes by the unknown interaction model. Besides, high-dimensional and nonlinear state trajectories make difficult to identify if two nodes are connected. Current solutions rely on prior knowledge of the graph topology and the dynamic behavior of the nodes, and hence, have poor generalization to other network configurations. To address these issues, we propose a novel learning-based approach that combines (i) a strongly convex program that efficiently uncovers graph topologies with global convergence guarantees and (ii) a self-attention encoder that learns to embed the original state trajectories into a feature space and predicts appropriate regularizers for the optimization program. In contrast to other works, our approach can identify the graph topology of unseen networks with new configurations in terms of number of nodes, connectivity or state trajectories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in identifying graphs in multi-robot formation and flocking tasks. ",

    "title": "Causal Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering",
    "abstract": "Graph collaborative filtering (GCF) has gained considerable attention in recommendation systems by leveraging graph learning techniques to enhance collaborative filtering (CF) models. One classical approach in GCF is to learn user and item embeddings by modeling complex graph relations and utilizing these embeddings for CF models. However, the quality of the embeddings significantly impacts the recommendation performance of GCF models. In this paper, we argue that existing graph learning methods are insufficient in generating satisfactory embeddings for CF models. This is because they aggregate neighboring node messages directly, which can result in incorrect estimations of user-item correlations. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach that incorporates causal modeling to explicitly encode the causal effects of neighboring nodes on the target node. This approach enables us to identify spurious correlations and uncover the root causes of user preferences. We introduce Causal Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (CNGCF), the first causality-aware graph learning framework for CF. CNGCF integrates causal modeling into the graph representation learning process, explicitly coupling causal effects between node pairs into the core message-passing process of graph learning. As a result, CNGCF yields causality-aware embeddings that promote robust recommendations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CNGCF provides precise recommendations that align with user preferences. Therefore, our proposed framework can address the limitations of existing GCF models and offer a more effective solution for recommendation systems. ",

FL enables the training of a global model among clients without exposing local data.

In this study, we propose a novel dynamic cross-tier FL scheme, named FedDCT to increase training accuracy and performance in wireless communication networks. We utilize a tiering algorithm that dynamically divides clients into different tiers according to specific indicators and assigns specific timeout thresholds to each tier to reduce the training time required. To improve the accuracy of the model without increasing the training time, we introduce a cross-tier client selection algorithm that can effectively select the tiers and participants. Simulation experiments show that our scheme can make the model converge faster and achieve a higher accuracy in wireless communication networks. ",

    "abstract": "Cognitive diagnosis plays a vital role in modern intelligent education platforms to reveal students' proficiency in knowledge concepts for subsequent adaptive tasks. However, due to the requirement of high model interpretability, existing manually designed cognitive diagnosis models hold too simple architectures to meet the demand of current intelligent education systems, where the bias of human design also limits the emergence of effective cognitive diagnosis models. In this paper, we propose to automatically design novel cognitive diagnosis models by evolutionary multi-objective neural architecture search (NAS). Specifically, we observe existing models can be represented by a general model handling three given types of inputs and thus first design an expressive search space for the NAS task in cognitive diagnosis. Then, we propose multi-objective genetic programming (MOGP) to explore the NAS task's search space by maximizing model performance and interpretability. In the MOGP design, each architecture is transformed into a tree architecture and encoded by a tree for easy optimization, and a tailored genetic operation based on four sub-genetic operations is devised to generate offspring effectively. Besides, an initialization strategy is also suggested to accelerate the convergence by evolving half of the population from existing models' variants. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that the cognitive diagnosis models searched by the proposed approach exhibit significantly better performance than existing models and also hold as good interpretability as human-designed models.

Therefore, under these conditions, these graphs also admit implicit representations. The sign-rank of a matrix $M \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}^{N \\times N}$ is the smallest rank of a matrix $R$ such that $M_{i,j} = \\mathrm{sign}(R_{i,j})$ for all $i,j \\in [N]$; equivalently, it is the smallest dimension $d$ in which $M$ can be represented as a point-halfspace incidence matrix with halfspaces through the origin, and it is essentially equivalent to the unbounded-error communication complexity. Matrices of sign-rank 3 can achieve the maximum possible bounded-error randomized communication complexity $\\Theta(\\log N)$, and meanwhile the existence of implicit representations for graphs of bounded sign-rank (including UDGs, which have sign-rank 4) has been open since at least 2003. We prove that matrices of sign-rank 3, and UDGs, have constant randomized communication complexity if and only if they do not encode arbitrarily large instances of the Greater-Than communication problem, or, equivalently, if they do not contain arbitrarily large half-graphs as semi-induced subgraphs.

To address these concerns, we automate the construction of task-specific deep learning architectures optimized for device constraints through Neural Architecture Search (NAS). We present DCA-NAS, a principled method of fast neural network architecture search that incorporates edge-device constraints such as model size and floating-point operations. It incorporates weight sharing and channel bottleneck techniques to speed up the search time. Based on our experiments, we see that DCA-NAS outperforms manual architectures for similar sized models and is comparable to popular mobile architectures on various image classification datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Imagenet-1k.

As an example, in elasto-plasticity under large strain and rotations, given the Cauchy deformation tensor, it is a fundamental step to compute the logarithmic strain tensor. Recently, this approach has been also adopted in small-strain isotropic plasticity to reconstruct the stress tensor as a function of its eigenvalues, allowing the formulation of predictor-corrector return algorithms in the invariants space. These algorithms not only reduce the number of unknowns at the constitutive level, but also allow the correct handling of stress states in which the plastic normals are undefined, thus ensuring a better convergence with respect to the standard approach. While the eigenvalues of a symmetric, second-order tensor can be simply computed as a function of the tensor invariants, the computation of its eigenbasis can be more difficult, especially when two or more eigenvalues are coincident. Moreover, when a Newton-Rhapson algorithm is adopted to solve nonlinear problems in Computational Mechanics, also the tensorial derivatives of the eigenbasis, whose computation is still more complicate, are required to assemble the tangent matrix. A simple and comprehensive method is presented, which can be adopted to compute a closed form representation of a second-order tensor, as well as their derivatives with respect to the tensor itself, allowing a simpler implementation of spectral decomposition of a tensor in Computational Mechanics applications.

This enables handling big BDDs, but the performance suffers when dealing with moderate-sized BDDs. This is mostly due to initializing expensive external memory data structures, even if their contents can fit entirely inside internal memory. The contents of these auxiliary data structures always correspond to a graph cut in an input or output BDD. Specifically, these cuts respect the levels of the BDD. We formalise the shape of these cuts and prove sound upper bounds on their maximum size for each BDD operation. We have implemented these upper bounds within Adiar. With these bounds, it can predict whether a faster internal memory variant of the auxiliary data structures can be used. In practice, this improves Adiar's running time across the board. Specifically for the moderate-sized BDDs, this results in an average reduction of the computation time by 86.1% (median of 89.7%). In some cases, the difference is even 99.9\\%.

    "abstract": "In graph representation learning, it is important that the complex geometric structure of the input graph, e.g. hidden relations among nodes, is well captured in embedding space. However, standard Euclidean embedding spaces have a limited capacity in representing graphs of varying structures. A promising candidate for the faithful embedding of data with varying structure is product manifolds of component spaces of different geometries (spherical, hyperbolic, or euclidean). In this paper, we take a closer look at the structure of product manifold embedding spaces and argue that each component space in a product contributes differently to expressing structures in the input graph, hence should be weighted accordingly. This is different from previous works which consider the roles of different components equally. We then propose WEIGHTED-PM, a data-driven method for learning embedding of heterogeneous graphs in weighted product manifolds. Our method utilizes the topological information of the input graph to automatically determine the weight of each component in product spaces. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world graph datasets demonstrate that WEIGHTED-PM is capable of learning better graph representations with lower geometric distortion from input data, and performs better on multiple downstream tasks, such as word similarity learning, top-$k$ recommendation, and knowledge graph embedding.

    "abstract": "SfM (Structure from Motion) has been extensively used for UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) image orientation. Its efficiency is directly influenced by feature matching. Although image retrieval has been extensively used for match pair selection, high computational costs are consumed due to a large number of local features and the large size of the used codebook. Thus, this paper proposes an efficient match pair retrieval method and implements an integrated workflow for parallel SfM reconstruction. First, an individual codebook is trained online by considering the redundancy of UAV images and local features, which avoids the ambiguity of training codebooks from other datasets. Second, local features of each image are aggregated into a single high-dimension global descriptor through the VLAD (Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors) aggregation by using the trained codebook, which remarkably reduces the number of features and the burden of nearest neighbor searching in image indexing. Third, the global descriptors are indexed via the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) based graph structure for the nearest neighbor searching. Match pairs are then retrieved by using an adaptive threshold selection strategy and utilized to create a view graph for divide-and-conquer based parallel SfM reconstruction. Finally, the performance of the proposed solution has been verified using three large-scale UAV datasets. The test results demonstrate that the proposed solution accelerates match pair retrieval with a speedup ratio ranging from 36 to 108 and improves the efficiency of SfM reconstruction with competitive accuracy in both relative and absolute orientation.

We prove an upper bound on the \"rate\" at which neurons are added, and a computationally cheap lower bound on the expansion score.

In this context, we study the parameterised coverability problem of a configuration, which consists in determining whether there is an initialnumber of processes and an execution allowing to reach a configuration bigger than a given one. We show that this problem is EXPSPACE-complete and can be solved in polynomial time if the protocol is partitioned into two sets of states, the states from which a process can request a rendez-vous and the ones from which it can answer one. We also prove that the problem of the existence of an execution bringing all the processes in a final state is undecidable in our context. These two problems can be solved in polynomial time with the classical rendez-vous semantics. ",

As a result, texture plays a crucial role in the manufacturing industry and is extensively studied in the fields of computer vision and pattern recognition. However, real-world textures are susceptible to defects, which can degrade image quality and cause various issues. Therefore, there is a need for accurate and effective methods to detect texture defects. In this study, a simple autoencoder and Fourier transform are employed for texture defect detection. The proposed method combines Fourier transform analysis with the reconstructed template obtained from the simple autoencoder. Fourier transform is a powerful tool for analyzing the frequency domain of images and signals. Moreover, since texture defects often exhibit characteristic changes in specific frequency ranges, analyzing the frequency domain enables effective defect detection. The proposed method demonstrates effectiveness and accuracy in detecting texture defects. Experimental results are presented to evaluate its performance and compare it with existing approaches. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel abstraction of the image segmentation task in the form of a combinatorial optimization problem that we call the multi-separator problem. Feasible solutions indicate for every pixel whether it belongs to a segment or a segment separator, and indicate for pairs of pixels whether or not the pixels belong to the same segment. This is in contrast to the closely related lifted multicut problem where every pixel is associated to a segment and no pixel explicitly represents a separating structure. While the multi-separator problem is NP-hard, we identify two special cases for which it can be solved efficiently. Moreover, we define two local search algorithms for the general case and demonstrate their effectiveness in segmenting simulated volume images of foam cells and filaments. ",

    "title": "Source-Free Open-Set Domain Adaptation for Histopathological Images via  Distilling Self-Supervised Vision Transformer",
    "abstract": "There is a strong incentive to develop computational pathology models to i) ease the burden of tissue typology annotation from whole slide histological images; ii) transfer knowledge, e.g., tissue class separability from the withheld source domain to the distributionally shifted unlabeled target domain, and simultaneously iii) detect Open Set samples, i.e., unseen novel categories not present in the training source domain. This paper proposes a highly practical setting by addressing the abovementioned challenges in one fell swoop, i.e., source-free Open Set domain adaptation (SF-OSDA), which addresses the situation where a model pre-trained on the inaccessible source dataset can be adapted on the unlabeled target dataset containing Open Set samples. The central tenet of our proposed method is distilling knowledge from a self-supervised vision transformer trained in the target domain. We propose a novel style-based data augmentation used as hard positives for self-training a vision transformer in the target domain, yielding strongly contextualized embedding. Subsequently, semantically similar target images are clustered while the source model provides their corresponding weak pseudo-labels with unreliable confidence. Furthermore, we propose cluster relative maximum logit score (CRMLS) to rectify the confidence of the weak pseudo-labels and compute weighted class prototypes in the contextualized embedding space that are utilized for adapting the source model on the target domain. Our method significantly outperforms the previous methods, including open set detection, test-time adaptation, and SF-OSDA methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on three public histopathological datasets of colorectal cancer (CRC) assessment- Kather-16, Kather-19, and CRCTP.

    "abstract": "Recent work has explored Large Language Models (LLMs) to overcome the lack of training data for Information Retrieval (IR) tasks. The generalization abilities of these models have enabled the creation of synthetic in-domain data by providing instructions and a few examples on a prompt. InPars and Promptagator have pioneered this approach and both methods have demonstrated the potential of using LLMs as synthetic data generators for IR tasks. This makes them an attractive solution for IR tasks that suffer from a lack of annotated data. However, the reproducibility of these methods was limited, because InPars' training scripts are based on TPUs -- which are not widely accessible -- and because the code for Promptagator was not released and its proprietary LLM is not publicly accessible. To fully realize the potential of these methods and make their impact more widespread in the research community, the resources need to be accessible and easy to reproduce by researchers and practitioners. Our main contribution is a unified toolkit for end-to-end reproducible synthetic data generation research, which includes generation, filtering, training and evaluation. Additionally, we provide an interface to IR libraries widely used by the community and support for GPU. Our toolkit not only reproduces the InPars method and partially reproduces Promptagator, but also provides a plug-and-play functionality allowing the use of different LLMs, exploring filtering methods and finetuning various reranker models on the generated data. We also made available all the synthetic data generated in this work for the 18 different datasets in the BEIR benchmark which took more than 2,000 GPU hours to be generated as well as the reranker models finetuned on the synthetic data.

    "abstract": "Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is a critical task that aims to estimate the amount of time until a system fails, where the latter is formed by three main components, that is, the application, communication network, and RUL logic. In this paper, we provide an end-to-end analysis of an entire RUL-based chain. Specifically, we consider a factory floor where Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) transport dangerous liquids whose fall may cause injuries to workers. Regarding the communication infrastructure, the AGVs are equipped with 5G User Equipments (UEs) that collect real-time data of their movements and send them to an application server. The RUL logic consists of a Deep Learning (DL)-based pipeline that assesses if there will be liquid falls by analyzing the collected data, and, eventually, sending commands to the AGVs to avoid such a danger. According to this scenario, we performed End-to-End 5G NR-compliant network simulations to study the Round-Trip Time (RTT) as a function of the overall system bandwidth, subcarrier spacing, and modulation order. Then, via real-world experiments, we collect data to train, test and compare 7 DL models and 1 baseline threshold-based algorithm in terms of cost and average advance. Finally, we assess whether or not the RTT provided by four different 5G NR network architectures is compatible with the average advance provided by the best-performing one-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN). Numerical results show under which conditions the DL-based approach for RUL estimation matches with the RTT performance provided by different 5G NR network architectures. ",

In this case, salient objects are typically non-camouflaged, and camouflaged objects are usually not salient. Due to this inherent contradictory attribute, we introduce an uncertainty-aware learning pipeline to extensively explore the contradictory information of salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) via data-level and task-wise contradiction modeling. We first exploit the dataset correlation of these two tasks and claim that the easy samples in the COD dataset can serve as hard samples for SOD to improve the robustness of the SOD model. Based on the assumption that these two models should lead to activation maps highlighting different regions of the same input image, we further introduce a contrastive module with a joint-task contrastive learning framework to explicitly model the contradictory attributes of these two tasks. Different from conventional intra-task contrastive learning for unsupervised representation learning, our contrastive module is designed to model the task-wise correlation, leading to cross-task representation learning. To better understand the two tasks from the perspective of uncertainty, we extensively investigate the uncertainty estimation techniques for modeling the main uncertainties of the two tasks, namely task uncertainty (for SOD) and data uncertainty (for COD), and aiming to effectively estimate the challenging regions for each task to achieve difficulty-aware learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our solution leads to both state-of-the-art performance and informative uncertainty estimation. ",

We prove that for any GNN with piecewise polynomial activations, whose architecture size does not grow with the graph input sizes, there exists a pair of non-isomorphic rooted trees of depth two such that the GNN cannot distinguish their root vertex up to an arbitrary number of iterations. The proof relies on tools from the algebra of symmetric polynomials. In contrast, it was already known that unbounded GNNs (those whose size is allowed to change with the graph sizes) with piecewise polynomial activations can distinguish these vertices in only two iterations. Our results imply a strict separation between bounded and unbounded size GNNs, answering an open question formulated by [Grohe, 2021]. We next prove that if one allows activations that are not piecewise polynomial, then in two iterations a single neuron perceptron can distinguish the root vertices of any pair of nonisomorphic trees of depth two (our results hold for activations like the sigmoid, hyperbolic tan and others). This shows how the power of graph neural networks can change drastically if one changes the activation function of the neural networks. The proof of this result utilizes the Lindemann-Weierstrauss theorem from transcendental number theory. ",

    "abstract": "The rise of social media platforms has facilitated the formation of echo chambers, which are online spaces where users predominantly encounter viewpoints that reinforce their existing beliefs while excluding dissenting perspectives. This phenomenon significantly hinders information dissemination across communities and fuels societal polarization. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methods for quantifying echo chambers. In this paper, we present the Echo Chamber Score (ECS), a novel metric that assesses the cohesion and separation of user communities by measuring distances between users in the embedding space. In contrast to existing approaches, ECS is able to function without labels for user ideologies and makes no assumptions about the structure of the interaction graph. To facilitate measuring distances between users, we propose EchoGAE, a self-supervised graph autoencoder-based user embedding model that leverages users' posts and the interaction graph to embed them in a manner that reflects their ideological similarity. To assess the effectiveness of ECS, we use a Twitter dataset consisting of four topics - two polarizing and two non-polarizing. Our results showcase ECS's effectiveness as a tool for quantifying echo chambers and shedding light on the dynamics of online discourse. ",

    "abstract": "Learning effective representations of source code is critical for any Machine Learning for Software Engineering (ML4SE) system. Inspired by natural language processing, large language models (LLMs) like Codex and CodeGen treat code as generic sequences of text and are trained on huge corpora of code data, achieving state of the art performance on several software engineering (SE) tasks. However, valid source code, unlike natural language, follows a strict structure and pattern governed by the underlying grammar of the programming language. Current LLMs do not exploit this property of the source code as they treat code like a sequence of tokens and overlook key structural and semantic properties of code that can be extracted from code-views like the Control Flow Graph (CFG), Data Flow Graph (DFG), Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), etc. Unfortunately, the process of generating and integrating code-views for every programming language is cumbersome and time consuming. To overcome this barrier, we propose our tool COMEX - a framework that allows researchers and developers to create and combine multiple code-views which can be used by machine learning (ML) models for various SE tasks. Some salient features of our tool are: (i) it works directly on source code (which need not be compilable), (ii) it currently supports Java and C#, (iii) it can analyze both method-level snippets and program-level snippets by using both intra-procedural and inter-procedural analysis, and (iv) it is easily extendable to other languages as it is built on tree-sitter - a widely used incremental parser that supports over 40 languages. We believe this easy-to-use code-view generation and customization tool will give impetus to research in source code representation learning methods and ML4SE.

    "abstract": "Mining in proof-of-work blockchains has become an expensive affair requiring specialized hardware capable of executing several megahashes per second at huge electricity costs. Miners earn a reward each time they mine a block within the longest chain, which helps offset their mining costs. It is therefore of interest to miners to maximize the number of mined blocks in the blockchain and increase revenue. A key factor affecting mining rewards earned is the connectivity between miners in the peer-to-peer network. To maximize rewards a miner must choose its network connections carefully, ensuring existence of paths to other miners that are on average of a lower latency compared to paths between other miners. We formulate the problem of deciding whom to connect to for miners as a combinatorial bandit problem. Each node picks its neighbors strategically to minimize the latency to reach 90\\% of the hash power of the network relative to the 90-th percentile latency from other nodes. A key contribution of our work is the use of a network coordinates based model for learning the network structure within the bandit algorithm. Experimentally we show our proposed algorithm outperforming or matching baselines on diverse network settings. ",

    "abstract": "One of the fundamental steps toward understanding a complex system is identifying variation at the scale of the system's components that is most relevant to behavior on a macroscopic scale. Mutual information is a natural means of linking variation across scales of a system due to its independence of the particular functional relationship between variables. However, estimating mutual information given high-dimensional, continuous-valued data is notoriously difficult, and the desideratum -- to reveal important variation in a comprehensible manner -- is only readily achieved through exhaustive search. Here we propose a practical, efficient, and broadly applicable methodology to decompose the information contained in a set of measurements by lossily compressing each measurement with machine learning. Guided by the distributed information bottleneck as a learning objective, the information decomposition sorts variation in the measurements of the system state by relevance to specified macroscale behavior, revealing the most important subsets of measurements for different amounts of predictive information. Additional granularity is achieved by inspection of the learned compression schemes: the variation transmitted during compression is composed of distinctions among measurement values that are most relevant to the macroscale behavior. We focus our analysis on two paradigmatic complex systems: a Boolean circuit and an amorphous material undergoing plastic deformation. In both examples, specific bits of entropy are identified out of the high entropy of the system state as most related to macroscale behavior for insight about the connection between micro- and macro- in the complex system. The identification of meaningful variation in data, with the full generality brought by information theory, is made practical for the study of complex systems. ",

    "abstract": "Oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) is a premalignant histopathological diagnosis given to lesions of the oral cavity. Its grading suffers from significant inter-/intra- observer variability, and does not reliably predict malignancy progression, potentially leading to suboptimal treatment decisions. To address this, we developed a novel artificial intelligence algorithm that can assign an Oral Malignant Transformation (OMT) risk score, based on histological patterns in the in Haematoxylin and Eosin stained whole slide images, to quantify the risk of OED progression. The algorithm is based on the detection and segmentation of nuclei within (and around) the epithelium using an in-house segmentation model. We then employed a shallow neural network fed with interpretable morphological/spatial features, emulating histological markers. We conducted internal cross-validation on our development cohort (Sheffield; n = 193 cases) followed by independent validation on two external cohorts (Birmingham and Belfast; n = 92 cases). The proposed OMTscore yields an AUROC = 0.74 in predicting whether an OED progresses to malignancy or not. Survival analyses showed the prognostic value of our OMTscore for predicting malignancy transformation, when compared to the manually-assigned WHO and binary grades. Analysis of the correctly predicted cases elucidated the presence of peri-epithelial and epithelium-infiltrating lymphocytes in the most predictive patches of cases that transformed (p < 0.0001). This is the first study to propose a completely automated algorithm for predicting OED transformation based on interpretable nuclear features, whilst being validated on external datasets. The algorithm shows better-than-human-level performance for prediction of OED malignant transformation and offers a promising solution to the challenges of grading OED in routine clinical practice.

    "abstract": "Autonomous ultrasound (US) imaging has gained increased interest recently, and it has been seen as a potential solution to overcome the limitations of free-hand US examinations, such as inter-operator variations. However, it is still challenging to accurately map planned paths from a generic atlas to individual patients, particularly for thoracic applications with high acoustic-impedance bone structures under the skin. To address this challenge, a graph-based non-rigid registration is proposed to enable transferring planned paths from the atlas to the current setup by explicitly considering subcutaneous bone surface features instead of the skin surface. To this end, the sternum and cartilage branches are segmented using a template matching to assist coarse alignment of US and CT point clouds. Afterward, a directed graph is generated based on the CT template. Then, the self-organizing map using geographical distance is successively performed twice to extract the optimal graph representations for CT and US point clouds, individually. To evaluate the proposed approach, five cartilage point clouds from distinct patients are employed. The results demonstrate that the proposed graph-based registration can effectively map trajectories from CT to the current setup for displaying US views through limited intercostal space. The non-rigid registration results in terms of Hausdorff distance (Mean$\\pm$SD) is 9.48$\\pm$0.27 mm and the path transferring error in terms of Euclidean distance is 2.21$\\pm$1.11 mm. ",

A widely adopted approach involves domain informed high-throughput screening of individual components that can be combined into a formulation. This manages to accelerate the discovery of new compounds for a target application but still leave the process of identifying the right 'formulation' from the shortlisted chemical space largely a laboratory experiment-driven process. We report a deep learning model, Formulation Graph Convolution Network (F-GCN), that can map structure-composition relationship of the individual components to the property of liquid formulation as whole. Multiple GCNs are assembled in parallel that featurize formulation constituents domain-intuitively on the fly. The resulting molecular descriptors are scaled based on respective constituent's molar percentage in the formulation, followed by formalizing into a combined descriptor that represents a complete formulation to an external learning architecture. The use case of proposed formulation learning model is demonstrated for battery electrolytes by training and testing it on two exemplary datasets representing electrolyte formulations vs battery performance -- one dataset is sourced from literature about Li/Cu half-cells, while the other is obtained by lab-experiments related to lithium-iodide full-cell chemistry. The model is shown to predict the performance metrics like Coulombic Efficiency (CE) and specific capacity of new electrolyte formulations with lowest reported errors. The best performing F-GCN model uses molecular descriptors derived from molecular graphs that are informed with HOMO-LUMO and electric moment properties of the molecules using a knowledge transfer technique.

    "title": "Detecting periodic time scales in temporal networks",
    "abstract": "Temporal networks are commonly used to represent dynamical complex systems like social networks, simultaneous firing of neurons, human mobility or public transportation. Their dynamics may evolve on multiple time scales characterising for instance periodic activity patterns or structural changes. The detection of these time scales can be challenging from the direct observation of simple dynamical network properties like the activity of nodes or the density of links. Here we propose two new methods, which rely on already established static representations of temporal networks, namely supra-adjacency matrices and temporal event graphs. We define dissimilarity metrics extracted from these representations and compute their Fourier Transform to effectively identify dominant periodic time scales characterising the original temporal network. We demonstrate our methods using synthetic and real-world data sets describing various kinds of temporal networks. We find that while in all cases the two methods outperform the reference measures, the supra-adjacency based method identifies more easily periodic changes in network density, while the temporal event graph based method is better suited to detect periodic changes in the group structure of the network. Our methodology may provide insights into different phenomena occurring at multiple time-scales in systems represented by temporal networks. ",

For the nonparametric regression problem, it has been shown that an estimator using deep neural networks can achieve better performances in the sense of the $L2$-norm. In contrast, it is difficult for the neural estimator with least-squares to achieve the sup-norm convergence, due to the deep structure of neural network models. In this study, we develop an adversarial training scheme and investigate the sup-norm convergence of deep neural network estimators. First, we find that ordinary adversarial training makes neural estimators inconsistent. Second, we show that a deep neural network estimator achieves the optimal rate in the sup-norm sense by the proposed adversarial training with correction. We extend our adversarial training to general setups of a loss function and a data-generating function. Our experiments support the theoretical findings. ",

This work investigates the cooperation success condition in the context of biased payoff allocation and self-confidence. The first component allows the organizer in a spatial public goods game to receive a different proportion of goods than other participants. The second aspect influences the micro-level dynamics of strategy updates, wherein players can maintain their strategy with a certain weight. Analytical results are obtained on square lattices under the weak selection limit. If the organizer attempts to monopolize the public goods, cooperation becomes more attainable. If the confidence increases, cooperation is inhibited. Consequently, these elements have conflicting effects on cooperation, and their simultaneous presence can result in a heterogeneous change of the critical synergy factor. Our theoretical findings underscore the subtle implications of a mutual trait that may manifest as greediness or self-confidence under different circumstances, which are validated through Monte Carlo simulations.

We then consider a method, based on building a data-driven graph, for implementing such networks when one does not have global knowledge of the manifold, but merely has access to finitely many sample points. We provide sufficient conditions for the network to provably converge to its continuum limit as the number of sample points tends to infinity. Unlike previous work (which focused on specific MNN architectures and graph constructions), our rate of convergence does not explicitly depend on the number of filters used. Moreover, it exhibits linear dependence on the depth of the network rather than the exponential dependence obtained previously. ",

Hospitals often have strict guidelines on the types of annotations that should appear on imaging results. However, manually inspecting these images can be a cumbersome task. While a neural network could potentially automate the process, training such a model typically requires a dataset of paired input and target images, which in turn involves significant human labour. This study introduces an automated approach for detecting annotations in images. This is achieved by treating the annotations as noise, creating a self-supervised pretext task and using a model trained under the Noise2Noise scheme to restore the image to a clean state. We tested a variety of model structures on the denoising task against different types of annotation, including body marker annotation, radial line annotation, etc. Our results demonstrate that most models trained under the Noise2Noise scheme outperformed their counterparts trained with noisy-clean data pairs. The costumed U-Net yielded the most optimal outcome on the body marker annotation dataset, with high scores on segmentation precision and reconstruction similarity.

    "abstract": "Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods commonly confront two fundamental challenges: the accurate characterization of the prior distribution and the efficient evaluation of the likelihood. In the context of Bayesian studies on tomography, principal component analysis (PCA) can in some cases facilitate the straightforward definition of the prior distribution, while simultaneously enabling the implementation of accurate surrogate models based on polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) to replace computationally intensive full-physics forward solvers. When faced with scenarios where PCA does not offer a direct means of easily defining the prior distribution alternative methods like deep generative models (e.g., variational autoencoders (VAEs)), can be employed as viable options. However, accurately producing a surrogate capable of capturing the intricate non-linear relationship between the latent parameters of a VAE and the outputs of forward modeling presents a notable challenge. Indeed, while PCE models provide high accuracy when the input-output relationship can be effectively approximated by relatively low-degree multivariate polynomials, this condition is typically unmet when utilizing latent variables derived from deep generative models. In this contribution, we present a strategy that combines the excellent reconstruction performances of VAE in terms of prio representation with the accuracy of PCA-PCE surrogate modeling in the context of Bayesian ground penetrating radar (GPR) travel-time tomography. Within the MCMC process, the parametrization of the VAE is leveraged for prior exploration and sample proposal. Concurrently, modeling is conducted using PCE, which operates on either globally or locally defined principal components of the VAE samples under examination. ",

    "abstract": "Materials datasets are usually featured by the existence of many redundant (highly similar) materials due to the tinkering material design practice over the history of materials research. For example, the materials project database has many perovskite cubic structure materials similar to SrTiO$_3$. This sample redundancy within the dataset makes the random splitting of machine learning model evaluation to fail so that the ML models tend to achieve over-estimated predictive performance which is misleading for the materials science community. This issue is well known in the field of bioinformatics for protein function prediction, in which a redundancy reduction procedure (CD-Hit) is always applied to reduce the sample redundancy by ensuring no pair of samples has a sequence similarity greater than a given threshold. This paper surveys the overestimated ML performance in the literature for both composition based and structure based material property prediction. We then propose a material dataset redundancy reduction algorithm called MD-HIT and evaluate it with several composition and structure based distance threshold sfor reducing data set sample redundancy. We show that with this control, the predicted performance tends to better reflect their true prediction capability. Our MD-hit code can be freely accessed at https://github.com/usccolumbia/MD-HIT ",

Data-driven surrogate modeling provides computationally inexpensive alternatives to high-fidelity numerical simulators. While the commonly used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are powerful in approximating partial differential equation solutions, it remains challenging for CNNs to handle irregular and unstructured simulation meshes. However, subsurface simulation models often involve unstructured meshes with complex mesh geometries, which limits the application of CNNs. To address this challenge, here we construct surrogate models based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to approximate the spatial-temporal solutions of multi-phase flow and transport processes. We propose a new GCN architecture suited to the hyperbolic character of the coupled PDE system, to better capture the saturation dynamics. Results of 2D heterogeneous test cases show that our surrogates predict the evolutions of the pressure and saturation states with high accuracy, and the predicted rollouts remain stable for multiple timesteps. Moreover, the GCN-based models generalize well to irregular domain geometries and unstructured meshes that are unseen in the training dataset. ",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of multi-path entanglement distribution to a pair of nodes in a quantum network consisting of devices with non-deterministic entanglement swapping capabilities. Multi-path entanglement distribution enables a network to establish end-to-end entangled links across any number of available paths with pre-established link-level entanglement. Probabilistic entanglement swapping, on the other hand, limits the amount of entanglement that is shared between the nodes; this is especially the case when, due to architectural and other practical constraints, swaps must be performed in temporal proximity to each other. Limiting our focus to the case where only bipartite entangled states are generated across the network, we cast the problem as an instance of generalized flow maximization between two quantum end nodes wishing to communicate. We propose a mixed-integer quadratically constrained program (MIQCP) to solve this flow problem for networks with arbitrary topology. We then compute the overall network capacity, defined as the maximum number of EPR states distributed to users per time unit, by solving the flow problem for all possible network states generated by probabilistic entangled link presence and absence, and subsequently by averaging over all network state capacities. The MIQCP can also be applied to networks with multiplexed links. While our approach for computing the overall network capacity has the undesirable property that the total number of states grows exponentially with link multiplexing capability, it nevertheless yields an exact solution that serves as an upper bound comparison basis for the throughput performance of easily-implementable yet non-optimal entanglement routing algorithms. We apply our capacity computation method to several networks, including a topology based on SURFnet -- a backbone network used for research purposes in the Netherlands. ",

    "abstract": "New lesion segmentation is essential to estimate the disease progression and therapeutic effects during multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical treatments. However, the expensive data acquisition and expert annotation restrict the feasibility of applying large-scale deep learning models. Since single-time-point samples with all-lesion labels are relatively easy to collect, exploiting them to train deep models is highly desirable to improve new lesion segmentation. Therefore, we proposed a coaction segmentation (CoactSeg) framework to exploit the heterogeneous data (i.e., new-lesion annotated two-time-point data and all-lesion annotated single-time-point data) for new MS lesion segmentation. The CoactSeg model is designed as a unified model, with the same three inputs (the baseline, follow-up, and their longitudinal brain differences) and the same three outputs (the corresponding all-lesion and new-lesion predictions), no matter which type of heterogeneous data is being used. Moreover, a simple and effective relation regularization is proposed to ensure the longitudinal relations among the three outputs to improve the model learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that utilizing the heterogeneous data and the proposed longitudinal relation constraint can significantly improve the performance for both new-lesion and all-lesion segmentation tasks. Meanwhile, we also introduce an in-house MS-23v1 dataset, including 38 Oceania single-time-point samples with all-lesion labels.

    "abstract": "Many vehicle platforms typically use sensors such as LiDAR or camera for locally-referenced navigation with GPS for globally-referenced navigation. However, due to the unencrypted nature of GPS signals, all civilian users are vulner-able to spoofing attacks, where a malicious spoofer broadcasts fabricated signals and causes the user to track a false position fix. To protect against such GPS spoofing attacks, Chips-Message Robust Authentication (Chimera) has been developed and will be tested on the Navigation Technology Satellite 3 (NTS-3) satellite being launched later this year. However, Chimera authentication is not continuously available and may not provide sufficient protection for vehicles which rely on more frequent GPS measurements. In this paper, we propose a factor graph-based state estimation framework which integrates LiDAR and GPS while simultaneously detecting and mitigating spoofing attacks experienced between consecutive Chimera authentications. Our proposed framework combines GPS pseudorange measurements with LiDAR odometry to provide a robust navigation solution. A chi-squared detector, based on pseudorange residuals, is used to detect and mitigate any potential GPS spoofing attacks. We evaluate our method using real-world LiDAR data from the KITTI dataset and simulated GPS measurements, both nominal and with spoofing. Across multiple trajectories and Monte Carlo runs, our method consistently achieves position errors under 5 m during nominal conditions, and successfully bounds positioning error to within odometry drift levels during spoofed conditions.
