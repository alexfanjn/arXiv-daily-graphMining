    "abstract": "Digital twin technology has is anticipated to transform healthcare, enabling personalized medicines and support, earlier diagnoses, simulated treatment outcomes, and optimized surgical plans. Digital twins are readily gaining traction in industries like manufacturing, supply chain logistics, and civil infrastructure. Not in patient care, however. The challenge of modeling complex diseases with multimodal patient data and the computational complexities of analyzing it have stifled digital twin adoption in the biomedical vertical. Yet, these major obstacles can potentially be handled by approaching these models in a different way. This paper proposes a novel framework for addressing the barriers to clinical twin modeling created by computational costs and modeling complexities. We propose structuring patient health data as a knowledge graph and using closed-form continuous-time liquid neural networks, for real-time analytics. By synthesizing multimodal patient data and leveraging the flexibility and efficiency of closed form continuous time networks and knowledge graph ontologies, our approach enables real time insights, personalized medicine, early diagnosis and intervention, and optimal surgical planning. This novel approach provides a comprehensive and adaptable view of patient health along with real-time analytics, paving the way for digital twin simulations and other anticipated benefits in healthcare.

S2vNTM leverages the pattern of keywords to identify potential topics, as well as optimize the quality of topics' keywords sets. Across a variety of datasets, S2vNTM outperforms existing semi-supervised topic modeling methods in classification accuracy with limited keywords provided.

However, deploying real-time object detectors on resource-constrained platforms poses challenges due to high computational and memory requirements. This paper describes a low-bit quantization method to build a highly efficient one-stage detector, dubbed as Q-YOLO, which can effectively address the performance degradation problem caused by activation distribution imbalance in traditional quantized YOLO models. Q-YOLO introduces a fully end-to-end Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) pipeline with a well-designed Unilateral Histogram-based (UH) activation quantization scheme, which determines the maximum truncation values through histogram analysis by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) quantization errors. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Q-YOLO, outperforming other PTQ methods while achieving a more favorable balance between accuracy and computational cost. This research contributes to advancing the efficient deployment of object detection models on resource-limited edge devices, enabling real-time detection with reduced computational and memory overhead.

Recent works have advocated using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) for cellular network throughput prediction. In contrast, this work has proposed a low computationally complex simple solution which models the future throughput as a multiple linear regression of several present network parameters and present throughput. It then feeds the variance of prediction error and measurement error, which is inherent in any measurement setup but unaccounted for in existing works, to a Kalman filter-based prediction-correction approach to obtain the optimal estimates of the future throughput. Extensive experiments across seven publicly available 5G throughput datasets for different prediction window lengths have shown that the proposed method outperforms the baseline ML and DL algorithms by delivering more accurate results within a shorter timeframe for inferencing and retraining. Furthermore, in comparison to its ML and DL counterparts, the proposed throughput prediction method is also found to deliver higher QoE to both streaming and live video users when used in conjunction with popular Model Predictive Control (MPC) based adaptive bitrate streaming algorithms.

Current state-of-the-art methods use complex graphical models that utilize language cues and visual features to address this challenge. We hypothesize that the strong language priors in CLIP embeddings can simplify these graphical models paving for a simpler approach. We adopt the UVTransE relation prediction framework, which learns the relation as a translational embedding with subject, object, and union box embeddings from a scene. We systematically explore the design of CLIP-based subject, object, and union-box representations within the UVTransE framework and propose CREPE (CLIP Representation Enhanced Predicate Estimation). CREPE utilizes text-based representations for all three bounding boxes and introduces a novel contrastive training strategy to automatically infer the text prompt for union-box. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicate estimation, mR@5 27.79, and mR@20 31.95 on the Visual Genome benchmark, achieving a 15.3\\% gain in performance over recent state-of-the-art at mR@20.

A generic data-driven predictor is first trained to predict maximal frequency deviation and the highest locational RoCoF simultaneously based on a high-fidelity simulation dataset, and then incorporated into ALSNN-FCUC model. Sparse computation is introduced to avoid dense matrix multiplications. An active data sampling method is proposed to maintain the bindingness of the frequency related constraints. Besides, an active ReLU linearization method is implemented to further improve the algorithm efficiency while retaining solution quality.

This set of nodes reachable from a source defines an out-component, which identification is costly. In this paper, we propose an efficient matrix algorithm to tackle this issue and show that it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. Secondly, we propose a hashing framework to coarsen large temporal networks into smaller proxies on which out-components are easier to estimate, and then recombined to obtain the initial components.

This branch of game theory is used in the study of the adaptation of large, but finite, populations of agents to changes in the environment. It assumes that each agent has no significant influence on the system. Many scientific areas use the theory of evolutionary games. In particular, it is used in biology, medicine and the modelling of wireless networks. In this paper we study an evolutionary game with two levels of interaction between population agents. At the first level, changes in the population state depend on changes in the environment and on increasing or decreasing the resources available to the agents. At the second level, the populations state changes according to how the agents evaluate the state of the environment. These levels form a hierarchical structure. A change in one parameter of the system, which is responsible for the state of the environment, the population or the opinions of the agents, causes a change in the other elements of the system. The study involves the analysis of a modified evolutionary game taking into account the influence of the environment and the opinions of the agents. It also involves the development of computational methods in MATLAB and two sets of numerical experiments. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks have shown great ability in representation (GNNs) learning on graphs, facilitating various tasks. Despite their great performance in modeling graphs, recent works show that GNNs tend to inherit and amplify the bias from training data, causing concerns of the adoption of GNNs in high-stake scenarios. Hence, many efforts have been taken for fairness-aware GNNs. However, most existing fair GNNs learn fair node representations by adopting statistical fairness notions, which may fail to alleviate bias in the presence of statistical anomalies. Motivated by causal theory, there are several attempts utilizing graph counterfactual fairness to mitigate root causes of unfairness. However, these methods suffer from non-realistic counterfactuals obtained by perturbation or generation. In this paper, we take a causal view on fair graph learning problem. Guided by the casual analysis, we propose a novel framework CAF, which can select counterfactuals from training data to avoid non-realistic counterfactuals and adopt selected counterfactuals to learn fair node representations for node classification task. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show the effectiveness of CAF. ",

    "abstract": "The significance of multi-scale features has been gradually recognized by the edge detection community. However, the fusion of multi-scale features increases the complexity of the model, which is not friendly to practical application. In this work, we propose a Compact Twice Fusion Network (CTFN) to fully integrate multi-scale features while maintaining the compactness of the model. CTFN includes two lightweight multi-scale feature fusion modules: a Semantic Enhancement Module (SEM) that can utilize the semantic information contained in coarse-scale features to guide the learning of fine-scale features, and a Pseudo Pixel-level Weighting (PPW) module that aggregate the complementary merits of multi-scale features by assigning weights to all features. Notwithstanding all this, the interference of texture noise makes the correct classification of some pixels still a challenge. For these hard samples, we propose a novel loss function, coined Dynamic Focal Loss, which reshapes the standard cross-entropy loss and dynamically adjusts the weights to correct the distribution of hard samples. We evaluate our method on three datasets, i.e., BSDS500, NYUDv2, and BIPEDv2. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, CTFN achieves competitive accuracy with less parameters and computational cost. Apart from the backbone, CTFN requires only 0.1M additional parameters, which reduces its computation cost to just 60% of other state-of-the-art methods.

Specifically, recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variants (e.g. long short-term memory) are designed to retain long-term temporal correlations and therefore are suitable for modeling sequences. However, multi-regime models assume the traffic system to evolve through multiple states (say, free-flow, congestion in traffic) with distinct characteristics, and hence, separate models are trained to characterize the traffic dynamics within each regime. For instance, Markov-switching models with a hidden Markov model (HMM) for regime identification is capable of capturing complex dynamic patterns and non-stationarity. Interestingly, both HMM and LSTM can be used for modeling an observation sequence from a set of latent or, hidden state variables. In LSTM, the latent variable is computed in a deterministic manner from the current observation and the previous latent variable, while, in HMM, the set of latent variables is a Markov chain. Inspired by research in natural language processing, a hybrid hidden Markov-LSTM model that is capable of learning complementary features in traffic data is proposed for traffic flow prediction. Results indicate significant performance gains in using hybrid architecture compared to conventional methods such as Markov switching ARIMA and LSTM. ",

The theories view curiosity as an intrinsic motivation to optimize for topological features of subgraphs induced by the visited nodes in the environment. We use these proposed features as rewards for graph neural-network-based reinforcement learning. On multiple classes of synthetically generated graphs, we find that trained agents generalize to larger environments and to longer exploratory walks than are seen during training. Our method computes more efficiently than the greedy evaluation of the relevant topological properties. The proposed intrinsic motivations bear particular relevance for recommender systems. We demonstrate that curiosity-based recommendations are more predictive of human behavior than PageRank centrality for several real-world graph datasets, including MovieLens, Amazon Books, and Wikispeedia.

    "abstract": "DL compiler's primary function is to translate DNN programs written in high-level DL frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow into portable executables. These executables can then be flexibly executed by the deployed host programs. However, existing DL compilers rely on a tracing mechanism, which involves feeding a runtime input to a neural network program and tracing the program execution paths to generate the computational graph necessary for compilation. Unfortunately, this mechanism falls short when dealing with modern dynamic neural networks (DyNNs) that possess varying computational graphs depending on the inputs. Consequently, conventional DL compilers struggle to accurately compile DyNNs into executable code. To address this limitation, we propose \\tool, a general approach that enables any existing DL compiler to successfully compile DyNNs. \\tool tackles the dynamic nature of DyNNs by introducing a compilation mechanism that redistributes the control and data flow of the original DNN programs during the compilation process. Specifically, \\tool develops program analysis and program transformation techniques to convert a dynamic neural network into multiple sub-neural networks. Each sub-neural network is devoid of conditional statements and is compiled independently. Furthermore, \\tool synthesizes a host module that models the control flow of the DyNNs and facilitates the invocation of the sub-neural networks. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of \\tool, achieving a 100\\% success rate in compiling all dynamic neural networks. Moreover, the compiled executables generated by \\tool exhibit significantly improved performance, running between $1.12\\times$ and $20.21\\times$ faster than the original DyNNs executed on general-purpose DL frameworks.

However, tracking maneuvering targets by cellular networks faces many challenges. For example, the dense network and high-speed targets make the selection of the sensing nodes (SNs), e.g., base stations, and the associated power allocation very difficult, given the stringent latency requirement of sensing applications. Existing methods have demonstrated engaging tracking performance, but with very high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a model-driven deep learning approach for SN selection to meet the latency requirement. To this end, we first propose an iterative SN selection method by jointly exploiting the majorization-minimization (MM) framework and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then, we unfold the iterative algorithm as a deep neural network (DNN) and prove its convergence. The proposed model-driven method has a low computational complexity, because the number of layers is less than the number of iterations required by the original algorithm, and each layer only involves simple matrix-vector additions/multiplications. Finally, we propose an efficient power allocation method based on fixed point (FP) water filling (WF) and solve the joint SN selection and power allocation problem under the alternative optimization framework. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves better performance than the conventional optimization-based methods with much lower computational complexity. ",

    "title": "A Multi-view Impartial Decision Network for Frontotemporal Dementia  Diagnosis",
    "abstract": "Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) diagnosis has been successfully progress using deep learning techniques. However, current FTD identification methods suffer from two limitations. Firstly, they do not exploit the potential of multi-view functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for classifying FTD. Secondly, they do not consider the reliability of the multi-view FTD diagnosis. To address these limitations, we propose a reliable multi-view impartial decision network (MID-Net) for FTD diagnosis in fMRI. Our MID-Net provides confidence for each view and generates a reliable prediction without any conflict. To achieve this, we employ multiple expert models to extract evidence from the abundant neural network information contained in fMRI images. We then introduce the Dirichlet Distribution to characterize the expert class probability distribution from an evidence level. Additionally, a novel Impartial Decision Maker (IDer) is proposed to combine the different opinions inductively to arrive at an unbiased prediction without additional computation cost. Overall, our MID-Net dynamically integrates the decisions of different experts on FTD disease, especially when dealing with multi-view high-conflict cases. Extensive experiments on a high-quality FTD fMRI dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms previous methods and provides high uncertainty for hard-to-classify examples. We believe that our approach represents a significant step toward the deployment of reliable FTD decision-making under multi-expert conditions. We will release the codes for reproduction after acceptance. ",

Nevertheless, a notable gap exists in the evaluation of causal discovery methods, where insufficient emphasis is placed on downstream inference. To address this gap, we evaluate six established baseline causal discovery methods and a newly proposed method based on GFlowNets, on the downstream task of treatment effect estimation. Through the implementation of a robust evaluation procedure, we offer valuable insights into the efficacy of these causal discovery methods for treatment effect estimation, considering both synthetic and real-world scenarios, as well as low-data scenarios. Furthermore, the results of our study demonstrate that GFlowNets possess the capability to effectively capture a wide range of useful and diverse ATE modes. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are of critical use in different domains. To accelerate DNN computation, tensor compilers are proposed to generate efficient code on different domain-specific accelerators. Existing tensor compilers mainly focus on optimizing computation efficiency. However, memory access is becoming a key performance bottleneck because the computational performance of accelerators is increasing much faster than memory performance. The lack of direct description of memory access and data dependence in current tensor compilers' intermediate representation (IR) brings significant challenges to generate memory-efficient code. In this paper, we propose IntelliGen, a tensor compiler that can generate high-performance code for memory-intensive operators by considering both computation and data movement optimizations. IntelliGen represent a DNN program using GIR, which includes primitives indicating its computation, data movement, and parallel strategies. This information will be further composed as an instruction-level dataflow graph to perform holistic optimizations by searching different memory access patterns and computation operations, and generating memory-efficient code on different hardware. We evaluate IntelliGen on NVIDIA GPU, AMD GPU, and Cambricon MLU, showing speedup up to 1.97x, 2.93x, and 16.91x(1.28x, 1.23x, and 2.31x on average), respectively, compared to current most performant frameworks.

For example, in financial services, companies may benefit from providing relevant financial articles to their customers to cultivate relationships, foster client engagement and promote informed financial decisions. While several approaches center on KG-based recommender systems for improved content, in this study we focus on interpretable KG-based recommender systems for decision making.To this end, we present two knowledge graph-based approaches for personalized article recommendations for a set of customers of a large multinational financial services company. The first approach employs Reinforcement Learning and the second approach uses the XGBoost algorithm for recommending articles to the customers. Both approaches make use of a KG generated from both structured (tabular data) and unstructured data (a large body of text data).Using the Reinforcement Learning-based recommender system we could leverage the graph traversal path leading to the recommendation as a way to generate interpretations (Path Directed Reasoning (PDR)). In the XGBoost-based approach, one can also provide explainable results using post-hoc methods such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and ELI5 (Explain Like I am Five).Importantly, our approach offers explainable results, promoting better decision-making. This study underscores the potential of combining advanced machine learning techniques with KG-driven insights to bolster experience in customer relationship management. ",

We address the existence and stability of the solution, as well as approximation bounds. More precisely, we prove the existence of discrete solutions, intended in a suitable weak sense, for which we prove a quasi-best approximation estimate similar to Cea's lemma, a result commonly found in finite element methods. We also propose two new stabilized WAN-based formulas that avoid the need for direct normalization. Furthermore, we analyze the method's effectiveness for the Dirichlet boundary problem that employs the implicit representation of the geometry. The key requirement for achieving the best approximation outcome is to ensure that the space for the test network satisfies a specific condition, known as the inf-sup condition, essentially requiring that the test network set is sufficiently large when compared to the trial space. The method's accuracy, however, is only determined by the space of the trial network. We also devise a pseudo-time XNODE neural network class for static PDE problems, yielding significantly faster convergence results than the classical DNN network. ",

To this end, we modify the original texts using a set of phrases - modifiers that correspond to universal quantifiers, existential quantifiers, negation, and other concept modifiers in Natural Logic (NL) (MacCartney, 2009). We use these phrases to modify the subject, verb, and object parts of the premise and hypothesis. Lastly, we annotate these modified texts with the corresponding entailment labels following NL rules. We conduct a preliminary verification of how well the change in the structural and semantic composition is captured by neural NLI models, in both zero-shot and fine-tuned scenarios. We found that the performance of NLI models under the zero-shot setting is poor, especially for modified sentences with negation and existential quantifiers. After fine-tuning this dataset, we observe that models continue to perform poorly over negation, existential and universal modifiers. ",

DNNs have shown sometimes superior performance, even compared to humans, in cases such as self-driving, health applications, etc. Because of their computational complexity, deploying DNNs in resource-constrained devices still faces many challenges related to computing complexity, energy efficiency, latency, and cost. To this end, several research directions are being pursued by both academia and industry to accelerate and efficiently implement DNNs. One important direction is determining the appropriate data representation for the massive amount of data involved in DNN processing. Using conventional number systems has been found to be sub-optimal for DNNs. Alternatively, a great body of research focuses on exploring suitable number systems. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey and discussion about alternative number systems for more efficient representations of DNN data. Various number systems (conventional/unconventional) exploited for DNNs are discussed. The impact of these number systems on the performance and hardware design of DNNs is considered. In addition, this paper highlights the challenges associated with each number system and various solutions that are proposed for addressing them. The reader will be able to understand the importance of an efficient number system for DNN, learn about the widely used number systems for DNN, understand the trade-offs between various number systems, and consider various design aspects that affect the impact of number systems on DNN performance.

As our main technical contribution, we establish the tractability of computing a welfare-maximizing partitioning of the agents into coalitions on tree-like networks, for every score-based function u_v. We provide more efficient algorithms when dealing with specific choices of u_v or simpler networks, and also extend all of these results to computing coalitions that are Nash stable or individually rational. We view these results as a further strong indication of the usefulness of the proposed score-based utility function: even on very simple networks, the problem of computing a welfare-maximizing partitioning into coalitions remains open for the originally considered canonical function u.

Following the mapping and projection pinciples, a set of SAR images is modeled implicitly as a function of attenuation coefficients and scattering intensities in the 3D imaging space through a differentiable rendering equation. SAR-NeRF is then constructed to learn the distribution of attenuation coefficients and scattering intensities of voxels, where the vectorized form of 3D voxel SAR rendering equation and the sampling relationship between the 3D space voxels and the 2D view ray grids are analytically derived. Through quantitative experiments on various datasets, we thoroughly assess the multi-view representation and generalization capabilities of SAR-NeRF. Additionally, it is found that SAR-NeRF augumented dataset can significantly improve SAR target classification performance under few-shot learning setup, where a 10-type classification accuracy of 91.6\\% can be achieved by using only 12 images per class.

    "abstract": "By treating users' interactions as a user-item graph, graph learning models have been widely deployed in Collaborative Filtering(CF) based recommendation. Recently, researchers have introduced Graph Contrastive Learning(GCL) techniques into CF to alleviate the sparse supervision issue, which first constructs contrastive views by data augmentations and then provides self-supervised signals by maximizing the mutual information between contrastive views. Despite the effectiveness, we argue that current GCL-based recommendation models are still limited as current data augmentation techniques, either structure augmentation or feature augmentation. First, structure augmentation randomly dropout nodes or edges, which is easy to destroy the intrinsic nature of the user-item graph. Second, feature augmentation imposes the same scale noise augmentation on each node, which neglects the unique characteristics of nodes on the graph. To tackle the above limitations, we propose a novel Variational Graph Generative-Contrastive Learning(VGCL) framework for recommendation. Specifically, we leverage variational graph reconstruction to estimate a Gaussian distribution of each node, then generate multiple contrastive views through multiple samplings from the estimated distributions, which builds a bridge between generative and contrastive learning. Besides, the estimated variances are tailored to each node, which regulates the scale of contrastive loss for each node on optimization. Considering the similarity of the estimated distributions, we propose a cluster-aware twofold contrastive learning, a node-level to encourage consistency of a node's contrastive views and a cluster-level to encourage consistency of nodes in a cluster. Finally, extensive experimental results on three public datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. ",

Moreover, few prior GNN-based detectors have recognized the significance of incorporating global information, which encompasses similar behavioral patterns and offers valuable insights for discriminative representation learning. Therefore, we propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network called Spatial-Temporal-Aware Graph Transformer (STA-GT) for transaction fraud detection problems. Specifically, we design a temporal encoding strategy to capture temporal dependencies and incorporate it into the graph neural network framework, enhancing spatial-temporal information modeling and improving expressive ability. Furthermore, we introduce a transformer module to learn local and global information. Pairwise node-node interactions overcome the limitation of the GNN structure and build up the interactions with the target node and long-distance ones.

To ensure a stable electricity distribution in this changing environment, we propose a robust energy management approach to deal with uncertainty occurring in microgrids. For this, we combine robust optimization with a rolling horizon framework to obtain an algorithm that is both, tractable and can deal with the considered uncertainty. The main contribution of this work lies within the development and testing of a dynamic scheduling tool, which identifies good starting time slots for the rolling horizon. Combining this scheduling tool with the rolling horizon framework results in a dynamic rolling horizon model, which better integrates uncertainty forecasts and realizations of uncertain parameters into the decision-making process. A case study reveals that the dynamic rolling horizon model outperforms the classical version by up to 57% in costs and increases the local use of PV by up to 11%. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promising results in various speech and natural language processing applications. However, its efficacy in music information retrieval (MIR) still remains largely unexplored. While previous SSL models pre-trained on music recordings may have been mostly closed-sourced, recent speech models such as wav2vec2.0 have shown promise in music modelling. Nevertheless, research exploring the effectiveness of applying speech SSL models to music recordings has been limited. We explore the music adaption of SSL with two distinctive speech-related models, data2vec1.0 and Hubert, and refer to them as music2vec and musicHuBERT, respectively. We train $12$ SSL models with 95M parameters under various pre-training configurations and systematically evaluate the MIR task performances with 13 different MIR tasks. Our findings suggest that training with music data can generally improve performance on MIR tasks, even when models are trained using paradigms designed for speech. However, we identify the limitations of such existing speech-oriented designs, especially in modelling polyphonic information. Based on the experimental results, empirical suggestions are also given for designing future musical SSL strategies and paradigms. ",

    "abstract": "We seek the best traffic allocation scheme for the edge-cloud computing network that satisfies constraints and minimizes the cost based on burstable billing. First, for a fixed network topology, we formulate a family of integer programming problems with random parameters describing the various traffic demands. Then, to overcome the difficulty caused by the discrete feature of the problem, we generalize the Gumbel-softmax reparameterization method to induce an unconstrained continuous optimization problem as a regularized continuation of the discrete problem. Finally, we introduce the Gumbel-softmax sampling network to solve the optimization problems via unsupervised learning. The network structure reflects the edge-cloud computing topology and is trained to minimize the expectation of the cost function for unconstrained continuous optimization problems. The trained network works as an efficient traffic allocation scheme sampler, remarkably outperforming the random strategy in feasibility and cost function value. Besides testing the quality of the output allocation scheme, we examine the generalization property of the network by increasing the time steps and the number of users. We also feed the solution to existing integer optimization solvers as initial conditions and verify the warm-starts can accelerate the short-time iteration process. The framework is general with solid performance, and the decoupled feature of the random neural networks is adequate for practical implementations. ",

    "abstract": "Medical students and junior surgeons often rely on senior surgeons and specialists to answer their questions when learning surgery. However, experts are often busy with clinical and academic work, and have little time to give guidance. Meanwhile, existing deep learning (DL)-based surgical Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems can only provide simple answers without the location of the answers. In addition, vision-language (ViL) embedding is still a less explored research in these kinds of tasks. Therefore, a surgical Visual Question Localized-Answering (VQLA) system would be helpful for medical students and junior surgeons to learn and understand from recorded surgical videos. We propose an end-to-end Transformer with Co-Attention gaTed Vision-Language (CAT-ViL) for VQLA in surgical scenarios, which does not require feature extraction through detection models. The CAT-ViL embedding module is designed to fuse heterogeneous features from visual and textual sources. The fused embedding will feed a standard Data-Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) module, before the parallel classifier and detector for joint prediction. We conduct the experimental validation on public surgical videos from MICCAI EndoVis Challenge 2017 and 2018. The experimental results highlight the superior performance and robustness of our proposed model compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies further prove the outstanding performance of all the proposed components. The proposed method provides a promising solution for surgical scene understanding, and opens up a primary step in the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based VQLA system for surgical training.

    "abstract": "Requirements traceability is an important activity to reach an effective requirements management method in the requirements engineering. Requirement-to-Code Traceability Links (RtC-TLs) shape the relations between requirement and source code artifacts. RtC-TLs can assist engineers to know which parts of software code implement a specific requirement. In addition, these links can assist engineers to keep a correct mental model of software, and decreasing the risk of code quality degradation when requirements change with time mainly in large sized and complex software. However, manually recovering and preserving of these TLs puts an additional burden on engineers and is error-prone, tedious, and costly task. This paper introduces YamenTrace, an automatic approach and implementation to recover and visualize RtC-TLs in Object-Oriented software based on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). The originality of YamenTrace is that it exploits all code identifier names, comments, and relations in TLs recovery process. YamenTrace uses LSI to find textual similarity across software code and requirements. While FCA employs to cluster similar code and requirements together. Furthermore, YamenTrace gives a visualization of recovered TLs. To validate YamenTrace, it applied on three case studies. The findings of this evaluation prove the importance and performance of YamenTrace proposal as most of RtC-TLs were correctly recovered and visualized. ",

The present work is exploratory in nature, and we restrict the description and experiments to (i) simple feedforward neural networks, (ii) scalar (single output) regression problems, and (iii) invertible activation functions. However, the approach is intended to be extensible to larger, more complex architectures. The key idea is the observation that the input to every neuron in a neural network is a linear combination of the activations of neurons in the previous layer, as well as the parameters (weights and biases) of the layer. If we are able to compute the ideal total input values to every neuron by working backwards from the output, we can formulate the learning problem as a linear least squares problem which iterates between updating the parameters and the activation values. We present an explicit algorithm that implements this idea, and we show that (at least for simple problems) the approach is more stable and faster than gradient-based backpropagation. ",

    "abstract": "Several membership inference (MI) attacks have been proposed to audit a target DNN. Given a set of subjects, MI attacks tell which subjects the target DNN has seen during training. This work focuses on the post-training MI attacks emphasizing high confidence membership detection -- True Positive Rates (TPR) at low False Positive Rates (FPR). Current works in this category -- likelihood ratio attack (LiRA) and enhanced MI attack (EMIA) -- only perform well on complex datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10 and Imagenet) where the target DNN overfits its train set, but perform poorly on simpler datasets (0% TPR by both attacks on Fashion-MNIST, 2% and 0% TPR respectively by LiRA and EMIA on MNIST at 1% FPR). To address this, firstly, we unify current MI attacks by presenting a framework divided into three stages -- preparation, indication and decision. Secondly, we utilize the framework to propose two novel attacks: (1) Adversarial Membership Inference Attack (AMIA) efficiently utilizes the membership and the non-membership information of the subjects while adversarially minimizing a novel loss function, achieving 6% TPR on both Fashion-MNIST and MNIST datasets; and (2) Enhanced AMIA (E-AMIA) combines EMIA and AMIA to achieve 8% and 4% TPRs on Fashion-MNIST and MNIST datasets respectively, at 1% FPR. Thirdly, we introduce two novel augmented indicators that positively leverage the loss information in the Gaussian neighborhood of a subject. This improves TPR of all four attacks on average by 2.5% and 0.25% respectively on Fashion-MNIST and MNIST datasets at 1% FPR. Finally, we propose simple, yet novel, evaluation metric, the running TPR average (RTA) at a given FPR, that better distinguishes different MI attacks in the low FPR region. We also show that AMIA and E-AMIA are more transferable to the unknown DNNs (other than the target DNN) and are more robust to DP-SGD training as compared to LiRA and EMIA. ",

In this paper, we address this question and present several contributions. We propose three reject option models for OOD setups: the Cost-based model, the Bounded TPR-FPR model, and the Bounded Precision-Recall model. These models extend the standard reject option models used in non-OOD setups and define the notion of an optimal OOD selective classifier. We establish that all the proposed models, despite their different formulations, share a common class of optimal strategies. Motivated by the optimal strategy, we introduce double-score OOD methods that leverage uncertainty scores from two chosen OOD detectors: one focused on OOD/ID discrimination and the other on misclassification detection. The experimental results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of this simple strategy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we propose novel evaluation metrics derived from the definition of the optimal strategy under the proposed OOD rejection models. These new metrics provide a comprehensive and reliable assessment of OOD methods without the deficiencies observed in existing evaluation approaches. ",

Battery-less IoT devices live and die with ambient energy, as they use energy harvesting to power their operation. They are employed in a multitude of applications, including safety-critical ones such as biomedical implants. Due to scarce energy intakes and limited energy buffers, their executions become intermittent, alternating periods of active operation with periods of recharging their energy buffers. Experimental evidence exists that shows how controlling ambient energy allows an attacker to steer a device execution in unintended ways: energy provisioning effectively becomes an attack vector. We design, implement, and evaluate a mitigation system for energy attacks. By taking into account the specific application requirements and the output of an attack detection module, we tune task execution rates and optimize energy management. This ensures continued application execution in the event of an energy attack. When a device is under attack, our solution ensures the execution of 23.3% additional application cycles compared to the baselines we consider and increases task schedulability by at least 21%, while enabling a 34% higher peripheral availability.

Among the different variants of graph neural networks, graph attention networks (GATs) have been applied with great success to different tasks. In the GAT model, each node assigns an importance score to its neighbors using an attention mechanism. However, similar to other graph neural networks, GATs aggregate messages from nodes that belong to different classes, and therefore produce node representations that are not well separated with respect to the different classes, which might hurt their performance. In this work, to alleviate this problem, we propose a new technique that can be incorporated into any graph attention model to encourage higher attention scores between nodes that share the same class label.

First, we introduce a new \"compensated autocorrelation\" metric, providing a more analytically tractable solution with precise expressions for false-alarm and missed-detection probabilities. Second, this paper proposes the Pareto comparison principle for fair benchmarking packet-detection algorithms, considering both false alarms and missed detections simultaneously. Third, with the Pareto benchmarking scheme, we experimentally confirm that the performance of S&C can be greatly improved by taking only the real part and discarding the imaginary part of the autocorrelation, leading to the novel real-part S&C (RP-S&C) scheme. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, we utilize the compensated autocorrelation metric we newly put forth to extend the single-antenna algorithm to multi-antenna scenarios through a weighted-sum approach. Two optimization problems, minimizing false-alarm and missed-detection probabilities respectively, are formulated and solutions are provided. Our experimental results reveal that the optimal weights for false alarms (WFA) scheme is more desirable than the optimal weights for missed detections (WMD) due to its simplicity, reliability, and superior performance.

    "abstract": "Despite the impressive performance of recent unbiased Scene Graph Generation (SGG) methods, the current debiasing literature mainly focuses on the long-tailed distribution problem, whereas it overlooks another source of bias, i.e., semantic confusion, which makes the SGG model prone to yield false predictions for similar relationships. In this paper, we explore a debiasing procedure for the SGG task leveraging causal inference. Our central insight is that the Sparse Mechanism Shift (SMS) in causality allows independent intervention on multiple biases, thereby potentially preserving head category performance while pursuing the prediction of high-informative tail relationships. However, the noisy datasets lead to unobserved confounders for the SGG task, and thus the constructed causal models are always causal-insufficient to benefit from SMS. To remedy this, we propose Two-stage Causal Modeling (TsCM) for the SGG task, which takes the long-tailed distribution and semantic confusion as confounders to the Structural Causal Model (SCM) and then decouples the causal intervention into two stages. The first stage is causal representation learning, where we use a novel Population Loss (P-Loss) to intervene in the semantic confusion confounder. The second stage introduces the Adaptive Logit Adjustment (AL-Adjustment) to eliminate the long-tailed distribution confounder to complete causal calibration learning. These two stages are model agnostic and thus can be used in any SGG model that seeks unbiased predictions. Comprehensive experiments conducted on the popular SGG backbones and benchmarks show that our TsCM can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of mean recall rate. Furthermore, TsCM can maintain a higher recall rate than other debiasing methods, which indicates that our method can achieve a better tradeoff between head and tail relationships. ",

In this paper, we propose a double-RIS assisted multihop routing protocol for a device-to-device (D2D) communication network. Specifically, the protocol is dependent on the already deployed RISs and users in the surroundings. Besides the RISs, the emphasis of this work is to make more use of the existing intermediate users (IUs), which can act as relays. Hence, the density of RIS deployment in the surroundings can be reduced, which leads to the avoidance of resource wastage. However, we cannot solely depend on the IUs because this implies complete dependence on their availability for relaying and as a result, the aspect of reliability in terms of delay-constrained information transfer cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, the IUs are considered capable of energy harvesting and as a result, they do not waste their own energy in the process of volunteering to act as a relay for other users. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed protocol over some existing approaches and lastly, useful insights related to the protocol design are also drawn, where we characterize the maximum acceptable delay at each hop under different set-ups.

In particular, in industrial environments, operators should be able to interact with robots in a fast, effective, and possibly effortless manner.

Building upon this, in this paper we propose a system based on mixed reality that allows a ubiquitous interface for heterogeneous robotic systems in dynamic scenarios, where users are involved in different tasks and need to interact with different robots. By means of mixed reality, users can interact with a robot through manipulation of its virtual replica, which is always colocated with the user and is extracted when interaction is needed. The system has been tested in a simulated intralogistics setting, where different robots are present and require sporadic intervention by human operators, who are involved in other tasks. In our setting we consider the presence of drones and AGVs with different levels of autonomy, calling for different user interventions. The proposed approach has been validated in virtual reality, considering quantitative and qualitative assessment of performance and user's feedback. ",

This fundamental problem is known to be undecidable for $\\mathbb{Z}^{4 \\times 4}$ and decidable for $\\mathbb{Z}^{2 \\times 2}$. The Identity Problem has been recently shown to be in polynomial time by Dong for the Heisenberg group over complex numbers in any fixed dimension with the use of Lie algebra and the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. We develop alternative proof techniques for the problem making a step forward towards more general problems such as the Membership Problem. We extend our techniques to show that the fundamental problem of determining if a given set of Heisenberg matrices generates a group, can also be decided in polynomial time. ",

    "abstract": "Autonomous vehicles require accurate and reliable short-term trajectory predictions for safe and efficient driving. While most commercial automated vehicles currently use state machine-based algorithms for trajectory forecasting, recent efforts have focused on end-to-end data-driven systems. Often, the design of these models is limited by the availability of datasets, which are typically restricted to generic scenarios. To address this limitation, we have developed a synthetic dataset for short-term trajectory prediction tasks using the CARLA simulator. This dataset is extensive and incorporates what is considered complex scenarios - pedestrians crossing the road, vehicles overtaking - and comprises 6000 perspective view images with corresponding IMU and odometry information for each frame. Furthermore, an end-to-end short-term trajectory prediction model using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks has also been developed. This model can handle corner cases, such as slowing down near zebra crossings and stopping when pedestrians cross the road, without the need for explicit encoding of the surrounding environment. In an effort to accelerate this research and assist others, we are releasing our dataset and model to the research community. Our datasets are publicly available on https://github.com/navigatinguncertainty. ",

    "abstract": "The time evolution of physical systems is described by differential equations, which depend on abstract quantities like energy and force. Traditionally, these quantities are derived as functionals based on observables such as positions and velocities. Discovering these governing symbolic laws is the key to comprehending the interactions in nature. Here, we present a Hamiltonian graph neural network (HGNN), a physics-enforced GNN that learns the dynamics of systems directly from their trajectory. We demonstrate the performance of HGNN on n-springs, n-pendulums, gravitational systems, and binary Lennard Jones systems; HGNN learns the dynamics in excellent agreement with the ground truth from small amounts of data. We also evaluate the ability of HGNN to generalize to larger system sizes, and to hybrid spring-pendulum system that is a combination of two original systems (spring and pendulum) on which the models are trained independently. Finally, employing symbolic regression on the learned HGNN, we infer the underlying equations relating the energy functionals, even for complex systems such as the binary Lennard-Jones liquid. Our framework facilitates the interpretable discovery of interaction laws directly from physical system trajectories. Furthermore, this approach can be extended to other systems with topology-dependent dynamics, such as cells, polydisperse gels, or deformable bodies. ",

    "abstract": "Social learning is key in the development of both human and non-human animal societies. Here, we provide quantitative evidence that supports the existence of social learning in sperm whales across socio-cultural barriers, based on acoustic data from locations in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Sperm whale populations have traditionally been partitioned into clans based on their vocal repertoire (what they say) of rhythmically patterned clicks (codas), and in particular their identity codas, which serve as symbolic markers for each clan. However, identity codas account for between 35% and 60% of all codas vocalized depending on the different clans. We introduce a computational modeling approach that recovers clan structure and shows new evidence of social learning across clans from the internal temporal structure of non-identity codas, the remaining fraction of codas. The proposed method is based on vocal style, which encodes how sperm whales assemble individual clicks into codas. Specifically, we modeled clicking pattern data using generative models based on variable length Markov chains, producing what we term \"subcoda trees\". Based on our results, we propose here a new concept of vocal identity, which consists of both vocal repertoire and style. We show that (i) style-delimited clans are similar to repertoire-delimited clans, and that (ii) sympatry increases vocal style similarity between clans for non-identity codas, but has no significant effect on identity codas. This implies that different clans who geographically overlap have similar styles for most codas, which in turn implies social learning across cultural boundaries. More broadly, the proposed method provides a new framework for comparing communication systems of other animal species, with potential implications for our understanding of cultural transmission in animal societies.

We calculate various network metrics for each episode, such as node degree and graph density, and use these metrics to explore the potential relationship between network metrics and TV series reviews from IMDB. Our results show that certain network metrics of character interactions in episodes have a strong correlation with the review score of TV series. Our research aims to provide more quantitative information that can help TV producers understand how to adjust the character dynamics of future episodes to appeal to their audience.

    "abstract": "In a graph, a (perfect) matching cut is an edge cut that is a (perfect) matching. Matching Cut (MC), respectively, Perfect Matching Cut (PMC), is the problem of deciding whether a given graph has a matching cut, respectively, a perfect matching cut. The Disconnected Perfect Matching problem (DPM) is to decide if a graph has a perfect matching that contains a matching cut. Solving an open problem recently posed in [Lucke, Paulusma, Ries (ISAAC 2022), and Feghali, Lucke, Paulusma, Ries (arXiv:2212.12317)], we show that PMC is NP-complete in graphs without induced 14-vertex path $P_{14}$. Our reduction also works simultaneously for MC and DPM, improving the previous hardness results of MC on $P_{19}$-free graphs and of DPM on $P_{23}$-free graphs to $P_{14}$-free graphs for both problems. Actually, we prove a slightly stronger result: within $P_{14}$-free graphs, it is hard to distinguish between (i) those without matching cuts and those in which every matching cut is a perfect matching cut, (ii) those without perfect matching cuts and those in which every matching cut is a perfect matching cut, and (iii) those without disconnected perfect matchings and those in which every matching cut is a perfect matching cut. Moreover, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis, none of these problems can be solved in time $2^{o(n)}$ for $n$-vertex $P_{14}$-free input graphs. We also consider the problems in graphs without long induced cycles. It is known that MC is polynomially solvable in graphs without induced cycles of length at least 5 [Moshi (JGT 1989)].

The rare methods today achieving this objective at a Level Of Details $2$ rely on procedural approaches based on geometry, and need stereo images and/or LIDAR data as input. We here propose a method for urban 3D reconstruction named KIBS(\\textit{Keypoints Inference By Segmentation}), which comprises two novel features: i) a full deep learning approach for the 3D detection of the roof sections, and ii) only one single (non-orthogonal) satellite raster image as model input. This is achieved in two steps: i) by a Mask R-CNN model performing a 2D segmentation of the buildings' roof sections, and after blending these latter segmented pixels within the RGB satellite raster image, ii) by another identical Mask R-CNN model inferring the heights-to-ground of the roof sections' corners via panoptic segmentation, unto full 3D reconstruction of the buildings and city. We demonstrate the potential of the KIBS method by reconstructing different urban areas in a few minutes, with a Jaccard index for the 2D segmentation of individual roof sections of $88.55\\%$ and $75.21\\%$ on our two data sets resp., and a height's mean error of such correctly segmented pixels for the 3D reconstruction of $1.60$ m and $2.06$ m on our two data sets resp., hence within the LOD2 precision range.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a data-efficient detection method for deep neural networks against backdoor attacks under a black-box scenario. The proposed approach is motivated by the intuition that features corresponding to triggers have a higher influence in determining the backdoored network output than any other benign features. To quantitatively measure the effects of triggers and benign features on determining the backdoored network output, we introduce five metrics. To calculate the five-metric values for a given input, we first generate several synthetic samples by injecting the input's partial contents into clean validation samples. Then, the five metrics are computed by using the output labels of the corresponding synthetic samples. One contribution of this work is the use of a tiny clean validation dataset. Having the computed five metrics, five novelty detectors are trained from the validation dataset. A meta novelty detector fuses the output of the five trained novelty detectors to generate a meta confidence score. During online testing, our method determines if online samples are poisoned or not via assessing their meta confidence scores output by the meta novelty detector. We show the efficacy of our methodology through a broad range of backdoor attacks, including ablation studies and comparison to existing approaches. Our methodology is promising since the proposed five metrics quantify the inherent differences between clean and poisoned samples. Additionally, our detection method can be incrementally improved by appending more metrics that may be proposed to address future advanced attacks. ",

We designed the experiment to loosely resemble a driving situation where the haptic feedback was provided through a steering wheel (\\textit{Sensodrive}), while the accompanying audio was played through noise cancelling headphones. Both feedbacks were designed to resemble rumble strips, that are generally installed on the side of major roadways as a safety tool. The results indicate that, for $50\\%$ of the participants, asynchrony was detectable outside the range of -75 ms and 110 ms, where the former is related to perceiving audio before haptic and vice versa for the latter.

Using data collected during the Covid-19 pandemic in Hungary, we first identify the dimensions along which individuals exhibit the greatest variation in their contact patterns and vaccination attitudes. We find that generally privileged groups of the population have higher number of contact and a higher vaccination uptake with respect to disadvantaged groups. Subsequently, we propose a data-driven epidemiological model that incorporates these behavioral differences. Finally, we apply our model to analyze the fourth wave of Covid-19 in Hungary, providing valuable insights into real-world scenarios. By bridging the gap between individual characteristics and epidemic spread, our research contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of disease dynamics and informs effective public health strategies.

However, challenges arising from device complexity and availability, cost and analytical methodology have limited widespread application of such tools. Research Question: Can accelerometer data from commercially-available smartphones be used to extract gait CFs across a broad range of attainable gait velocities in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and typically developing controls (TDs) using machine learning (ML)-based methods Methods: Fifteen children with DMD and 15 TDs underwent supervised clinical testing across a range of gait speeds using 10 or 25m run/walk (10MRW, 25MRW), 100m run/walk (100MRW), 6-minute walk (6MWT) and free-walk (FW) evaluations while wearing a mobile phone-based accelerometer at the waist near the body's center of mass. Gait CFs were extracted from the accelerometer data using a multi-step machine learning-based process and results were compared to ground-truth observation data. Results: Model predictions vs. observed values for step counts, distance traveled, and step length showed a strong correlation (Pearson's r = -0.9929 to 0.9986, p<0.0001). The estimates demonstrated a mean (SD) percentage error of 1.49% (7.04%) for step counts, 1.18% (9.91%) for distance traveled, and 0.37% (7.52%) for step length compared to ground truth observations for the combined 6MWT, 100MRW, and FW tasks. Significance: The study findings indicate that a single accelerometer placed near the body's center of mass can accurately measure CFs across different gait speeds in both TD and DMD peers, suggesting that there is potential for accurately measuring CFs in the community with consumer-level smartphones.

    "abstract": "Precise measurements of the black hole mass are essential to gain insight on the black hole and host galaxy co-evolution. A direct measure of the black hole mass is often restricted to nearest galaxies and instead, an indirect method using the single-epoch virial black hole mass estimation is used for objects at high redshifts. However, this method is subjected to biases and uncertainties as it is reliant on the scaling relation from a small sample of local active galactic nuclei. In this study, we propose the application of conformalised quantile regression (CQR) to quantify the uncertainties of the black hole predictions in a machine learning setting. We compare CQR with various prediction interval techniques and demonstrated that CQR can provide a more useful prediction interval indicator. In contrast to baseline approaches for prediction interval estimation, we show that the CQR method provides prediction intervals that adjust to the black hole mass and its related properties. That is it yields a tighter constraint on the prediction interval (hence more certain) for a larger black hole mass, and accordingly, bright and broad spectral line width source. Using a combination of neural network model and CQR framework, the recovered virial black hole mass predictions and uncertainties are comparable to those measured from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

    "abstract": "A paradigm put forth by E. Schr\\\"odinger in 1931/32, known as Schr\\\"odinger bridges, represents a formalism to pose and solve control and estimation problems seeking a perturbation from an initial control schedule (in the case of control), or from a prior probability law (in the case of estimation), sufficient to reconcile data in the form of marginal distributions and minimal in the sense of relative entropy to the prior. In the same spirit, we consider traffic-flow and apply a Schr\\\"odinger-type dictum, to perturb minimally with respect to a suitable relative entropy functional a prior schedule/law so as to reconcile the traffic flow with scarce aggregate distributions on families of indistinguishable individuals. Specifically, we consider the problem to regulate/estimate multi-commodity network flow rates based only on empirical distributions of commodities being transported (e.g., types of vehicles through a network, in motion) at two given times. Thus, building on Schr\\\"odinger's large deviation rationale, we develop a method to identify {\\em the most likely flow rates (traffic flow)}, given prior information and aggregate observations. Our method further extends the Schr\\\"odinger bridge formalism to the multi-commodity setting, allowing commodities to exit or enter the flow field as well (e.g., vehicles to enter and stop and park) at any time. The behavior of entering or exiting the flow field, by commodities or vehicles, is modeled by a Markov chains with killing and creation states. Our method is illustrated with a numerical experiment.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) speech representations learned from large amounts of diverse, mixed-quality speech data without transcriptions are gaining ground in many speech technology applications. Prior work has shown that SSL is an effective intermediate representation in two-stage text-to-speech (TTS) for both read and spontaneous speech. However, it is still not clear which SSL and which layer from each SSL model is most suited for spontaneous TTS. We address this shortcoming by extending the scope of comparison for SSL in spontaneous TTS to 6 different SSLs and 3 layers within each SSL. Furthermore, SSL has also shown potential in predicting the mean opinion scores (MOS) of synthesized speech, but this has only been done in read-speech MOS prediction. We extend an SSL-based MOS prediction framework previously developed for scoring read speech synthesis and evaluate its performance on synthesized spontaneous speech. All experiments are conducted twice on two different spontaneous corpora in order to find generalizable trends. Overall, we present comprehensive experimental results on the use of SSL in spontaneous TTS and MOS prediction to further quantify and understand how SSL can be used in spontaneous TTS.

Recent works use Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to build the coordinate-based mapping between sinograms and CT images. However, these methods have not considered the correlation between adjacent projection views, resulting in aliasing artifacts on SV sinograms. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised SVCT reconstruction method -- Anti-Aliasing Projection Representation Field (APRF), which can build the continuous representation between adjacent projection views via the spatial constraints. Specifically, APRF only needs SV sinograms for training, which first employs a line-segment sampling module to estimate the distribution of projection views in a local region, and then synthesizes the corresponding sinogram values using center-based line integral module. After training APRF on a single SV sinogram itself, it can synthesize the corresponding dense-view (DV) sinogram with consistent continuity. High-quality CT images can be obtained by applying re-projection techniques on the predicted DV sinograms. Extensive experiments on CT images demonstrate that APRF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, yielding more accurate details and fewer artifacts. Our code will be publicly available soon. ",

Computing solubility using first-principles methods requires accounting for the competing effects of entropy and enthalpy, resulting in long computations for relatively poor accuracy.

Additionally, ease of use remains a concern for any computational technique, resulting in the sustained popularity of group-based contribution methods. In this work, we addressed these problems with a deep learning model with predictive uncertainty that runs on a static website (without a server). This approach moves computing needs onto the website visitor without requiring installation, removing the need to pay for and maintain servers. Our model achieves satisfactory results in solubility prediction. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to create molecular property prediction models that balance uncertainty and ease of use.

For the successful application of MUSIC, exact values of permittivity, conductivity, and permeability of the background must be known. If one of these values is unknown, it will fail to identify the location of an anomaly. However, to the best of our knowledge, no explanation of this failure has been provided yet. In this paper, we consider the application of MUSIC to the localization of a small anomaly from scattering parameter data when complete information of the background is not available. Thanks to the framework of the integral equation formulation for the scattering parameter data, an analytical expression of the MUSIC-type imaging function in terms of the infinite series of Bessel functions of integer order is derived. Based on the theoretical result, we confirm that the identification of a small anomaly is significantly affected by the applied values of permittivity and conductivity. However, fortunately, it is possible to recognize the anomaly if the applied value of conductivity is small. Simulation results with synthetic data are reported to demonstrate the theoretical result.

However, PPG signals collected from such devices are susceptible to corruption from noise and motion artifacts, which cause errors in heart rate estimation. Typical denoising approaches filter or reconstruct the signal in ways that eliminate much of the morphological information, even from the clean parts of the signal that would be useful to preserve. In this work, we develop an algorithm for denoising PPG signals that reconstructs the corrupted parts of the signal, while preserving the clean parts of the PPG signal. Our novel framework relies on self-supervised training, where we leverage a large database of clean PPG signals to train a denoising autoencoder. As we show, our reconstructed signals provide better estimates of heart rate from PPG signals than the leading heart rate estimation methods. Further experiments show significant improvement in Heart Rate Variability (HRV) estimation from PPG signals using our algorithm. We conclude that our algorithm denoises PPG signals in a way that can improve downstream analysis of many different health metrics from wearable devices. ",

To overcome this, we present an approach that utilizes prior knowledge to regularize the training process over larger parameter spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various scenarios, including multilayer structures with box model parameterization and a physics-inspired special parameterization of the scattering length density profile for a multilayer structure.

The current sensory evaluation of taste mainly relies on artificial sensory evaluation and electronic tongue, but the former has strong subjectivity and poor repeatability, and the latter is not flexible enough. This work proposed a strategy for acquiring and recognizing taste electroencephalogram (EEG), aiming to decode people's objective perception of taste through taste EEG. Firstly, according to the proposed experimental paradigm, the taste EEG of subjects under different taste stimulation was collected. Secondly, to avoid insufficient training of the model due to the small number of taste EEG samples, a Temporal and Spatial Reconstruction Data Augmentation (TSRDA) method was proposed, which effectively augmented the taste EEG by reconstructing the taste EEG's important features in temporal and spatial dimensions. Thirdly, a multi-view channel attention module was introduced into a designed convolutional neural network to extract the important features of the augmented taste EEG. The proposed method has accuracy of 99.56%, F1-score of 99.48%, and kappa of 99.38%, proving the method's ability to distinguish the taste EEG evoked by different taste stimuli successfully. In summary, combining TSRDA with taste EEG technology provides an objective and effective method for sensory evaluation of food taste. ",

To extract features and enhance accuracy, emotion recognition using brain waves or EEG signals requires the implementation of efficient signal processing techniques. Various approaches to human-machine interaction technologies have been ongoing for a long time, and in recent years, researchers have had great success in automatically understanding emotion using brain signals. In our research, several emotional states were classified and tested on EEG signals collected from a well-known publicly available dataset, the DEAP Dataset, using SVM (Support Vector Machine), KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor), and an advanced neural network model, RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), trained with LSTM (Long Short Term Memory).

Exiting state-of-the-art models rely on a single modality of crystal data i.e. crystal graph structure, where they construct multi-graph by establishing edges between nearby atoms in 3D space and apply GNN to learn materials representation. Thereby, they encode local chemical semantics around the atoms successfully but fail to capture important global periodic structural information like space group number, crystal symmetry, rotational information, etc, which influence different crystal properties. In this work, we leverage textual descriptions of materials to model global structural information into graph structure and learn a more robust and enriched representation of crystalline materials. To this effect, we first curate a textual dataset for crystalline material databases containing descriptions of each material. Further, we propose CrysMMNet, a simple multi-modal framework, which fuses both structural and textual representation together to generate a joint multimodal representation of crystalline materials. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across ten different properties to show that CrysMMNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art baseline methods with a good margin. We also observe that fusing the textual representation with crystal graph structure provides consistent improvement for all the SOTA GNN models compared to their own vanilla versions. We have shared the textual dataset, that we have curated for both the benchmark material databases, with the community for future use. ",

To address this problem, this work proposes a Simplicial Message Passing (SMP) framework to better capture the topological information from molecules, which can break through the limitation within the vanilla message-passing paradigm. In SMP, a generalized message-passing framework is established for aggregating the information from arbitrary-order simplicial complex, and a hierarchical structure is elaborated to allow information exchange between different order simplices. We apply the SMP framework within deep learning architectures for quantum-chemical properties prediction and achieve state-of-the-art results. The results show that compared to traditional MPNN, involving higher-order simplex can better capture the complex structure of molecules and substantially enhance the performance of tasks.

    "title": "Geometric Neural Diffusion Processes",
    "abstract": "Denoising diffusion models have proven to be a flexible and effective paradigm for generative modelling. Their recent extension to infinite dimensional Euclidean spaces has allowed for the modelling of stochastic processes. However, many problems in the natural sciences incorporate symmetries and involve data living in non-Euclidean spaces. In this work, we extend the framework of diffusion models to incorporate a series of geometric priors in infinite-dimension modelling. We do so by a) constructing a noising process which admits, as limiting distribution, a geometric Gaussian process that transforms under the symmetry group of interest, and b) approximating the score with a neural network that is equivariant w.r.t. this group. We show that with these conditions, the generative functional model admits the same symmetry. We demonstrate scalability and capacity of the model, using a novel Langevin-based conditional sampler, to fit complex scalar and vector fields, with Euclidean and spherical codomain, on synthetic and real-world weather data.
