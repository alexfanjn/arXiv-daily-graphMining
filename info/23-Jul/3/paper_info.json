    "title": "RECAP-KG: Mining Knowledge Graphs from Raw GP Notes for Remote COVID-19  Assessment in Primary Care",
    "abstract": "Clinical decision-making is a fundamental stage in delivering appropriate care to patients. In recent years several decision-making systems designed to aid the clinician in this process have been developed. However, technical solutions currently in use are based on simple regression models and are only able to take into account simple pre-defined multiple-choice features, such as patient age, pre-existing conditions, smoker status, etc. One particular source of patient data, that available decision-making systems are incapable of processing is the collection of patient consultation GP notes. These contain crucial signs and symptoms - the information used by clinicians in order to make a final decision and direct the patient to the appropriate care. Extracting information from GP notes is a technically challenging problem, as they tend to include abbreviations, typos, and incomplete sentences. This paper addresses this open challenge. We present a framework that performs knowledge graph construction from raw GP medical notes written during or after patient consultations. By relying on support phrases mined from the SNOMED ontology, as well as predefined supported facts from values used in the RECAP (REmote COVID-19 Assessment in Primary Care) patient risk prediction tool, our graph generative framework is able to extract structured knowledge graphs from the highly unstructured and inconsistent format that consultation notes are written in. Our knowledge graphs include information about existing patient symptoms, their duration, and their severity. We apply our framework to consultation notes of COVID-19 patients in the UK COVID-19 Clinical Assesment Servcie (CCAS) patient dataset. We provide a quantitative evaluation of the performance of our framework, demonstrating that our approach has better accuracy than traditional NLP methods when answering questions about patients. ",

    "title": "Unsupervised Text Embedding Space Generation Using Generative  Adversarial Networks for Text Synthesis",
    "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) is a model for data synthesis, which creates plausible data through the competition of generator and discriminator. Although GAN application to image synthesis is extensively studied, it has inherent limitations to natural language generation. Because natural language is composed of discrete tokens, a generator has difficulty updating its gradient through backpropagation; therefore, most text-GAN studies generate sentences starting with a random token based on a reward system. Thus, the generators of previous studies are pre-trained in an autoregressive way before adversarial training, causing data memorization that synthesized sentences reproduce the training data. In this paper, we synthesize sentences using a framework similar to the original GAN. More specifically, we propose Text Embedding Space Generative Adversarial Networks (TESGAN) which generate continuous text embedding spaces instead of discrete tokens to solve the gradient backpropagation problem. Furthermore, TESGAN conducts unsupervised learning which does not directly refer to the text of the training data to overcome the data memorization issue. By adopting this novel method, TESGAN can synthesize new sentences, showing the potential of unsupervised learning for text synthesis. We expect to see extended research combining Large Language Models with a new perspective of viewing text as an continuous space. ",

    "abstract": "Satellite communication networks have attracted widespread attention for seamless network coverage and collaborative computing. In satellite-terrestrial networks, ground users can offload computing tasks to visible satellites that with strong computational capabilities. Existing solutions on satellite-assisted task computing generally focused on system performance optimization such as task completion time and energy consumption. However, due to the high-speed mobility pattern and unreliable communication channels, existing methods still suffer from serious privacy leakages. In this paper, we present an integrated satellite-terrestrial network to enable satellite-assisted task offloading under dynamic mobility nature. We also propose a privacy-preserving task offloading scheme to bridge the gap between offloading performance and privacy leakage. In particular, we balance two offloading privacy, called the usage pattern privacy and the location privacy, with different offloading targets (e.g., completion time, energy consumption, and communication reliability). Finally, we formulate it into a joint optimization problem, and introduce a deep reinforcement learning-based privacy-preserving algorithm for an optimal offloading policy. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms other benchmark algorithms in terms of completion time, energy consumption, privacy-preserving level, and communication reliability. We hope this work could provide improved solutions for privacy-persevering task offloading in satellite-assisted edge computing. ",

However, a rigorous theoretical explanation for their success in the context of formal language theory has not yet been developed, as it is unclear why neural language models can learn the combinatorial rules that govern the next-word prediction task. In this paper, we study a class of formal languages that can be used to model real-world examples of English sentences.

    "abstract": "DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a target system with a large number of requests or traffic from multiple sources, disrupting the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network. Distinguishing between legitimate traffic and malicious traffic is a challenging task. It is possible to classify legitimate traffic and malicious traffic and analysis the network traffic by using machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, an inter-model explanation implemented to classify a traffic flow whether is benign or malicious is an important investigation of the inner working theory of the model to increase the trustworthiness of the model. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can explain the decision-making of the machine learning models that can be classified and identify DDoS traffic. In this context, we proposed a framework that can not only classify legitimate traffic and malicious traffic of DDoS attacks but also use SHAP to explain the decision-making of the classifier model. To address this concern, we first adopt feature selection techniques to select the top 20 important features based on feature importance techniques (e.g., XGB-based SHAP feature importance). Following that, the Multi-layer Perceptron Network (MLP) part of our proposed model uses the optimized features of the DDoS attack dataset as inputs to classify legitimate and malicious traffic. We perform extensive experiments with all features and selected features. The evaluation results show that the model performance with selected features achieves above 99\\% accuracy. Finally, to provide interpretability, XAI can be adopted to explain the model performance between the prediction results and features based on global and local explanations by SHAP, which can better explain the results achieved by our proposed framework.

    "abstract": "Recent results of machine learning for automatic vulnerability detection have been very promising indeed: Given only the source code of a function $f$, models trained by machine learning techniques can decide if $f$ contains a security flaw with up to 70% accuracy. But how do we know that these results are general and not specific to the datasets? To study this question, researchers proposed to amplify the testing set by injecting semantic preserving changes and found that the model's accuracy significantly drops. In other words, the model uses some unrelated features during classification. In order to increase the robustness of the model, researchers proposed to train on amplified training data, and indeed model accuracy increased to previous levels. In this paper, we replicate and continue this investigation, and provide an actionable model benchmarking methodology to help researchers better evaluate advances in machine learning for vulnerability detection. Specifically, we propose (i) a cross validation algorithm, where a semantic preserving transformation is applied during the amplification of either the training set or the testing set, and (ii) the amplification of the testing set with code snippets where the vulnerabilities are fixed. Using 11 transformations, 3 ML techniques, and 2 datasets, we find that the improved robustness only applies to the specific transformations used during training data amplification. In other words, the robustified models still rely on unrelated features for predicting the vulnerabilities in the testing data. Additionally, we find that the trained models are unable to generalize to the modified setting which requires to distinguish vulnerable functions from their patches. ",

    "abstract": "Estimating 3D human poses only from a 2D human pose sequence is thoroughly explored in recent years. Yet, prior to this, no such work has attempted to unify 2D and 3D pose representations in the shared feature space. In this paper, we propose MPM, a unified 2D-3D human pose representation framework via masked pose modeling. We treat 2D and 3D poses as two different modalities like vision and language and build a single-stream transformer-based architecture. We apply three pretext tasks, which are masked 2D pose modeling, masked 3D pose modeling, and masked 2D pose lifting to pre-train our network and use full-supervision to perform further fine-tuning. A high masking ratio of 72.5% in total with a spatio-temporal mask sampling strategy leading to better relation modeling both in spatial and temporal domains. MPM can handle multiple tasks including 3D human pose estimation, 3D pose estimation from occluded 2D pose, and 3D pose completion in a single framework. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on several widely used human pose datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.

    "abstract": "Accurate and timely detection of plant stress is essential for yield protection, allowing better-targeted intervention strategies. Recent advances in remote sensing and deep learning have shown great potential for rapid non-invasive detection of plant stress in a fully automated and reproducible manner. However, the existing models always face several challenges: 1) computational inefficiency and the misclassifications between the different stresses with similar symptoms; and 2) the poor interpretability of the host-stress interaction. In this work, we propose a novel fast Fourier Convolutional Neural Network (FFDNN) for accurate and explainable detection of two plant stresses with similar symptoms (i.e. Wheat Yellow Rust And Nitrogen Deficiency). Specifically, unlike the existing CNN models, the main components of the proposed model include: 1) a fast Fourier convolutional block, a newly fast Fourier transformation kernel as the basic perception unit, to substitute the traditional convolutional kernel to capture both local and global responses to plant stress in various time-scale and improve computing efficiency with reduced learning parameters in Fourier domain; 2) Capsule Feature Encoder to encapsulate the extracted features into a series of vector features to represent part-to-whole relationship with the hierarchical structure of the host-stress interactions of the specific stress. In addition, in order to alleviate over-fitting, a photochemical vegetation indices-based filter is placed as pre-processing operator to remove the non-photochemical noises from the input Sentinel-2 time series.

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led to a global pandemic of significant severity. In addition to its high level of contagiousness, COVID-19 can have a heterogeneous clinical course, ranging from asymptomatic carriers to severe and potentially life-threatening health complications. Many patients have to revisit the emergency room (ER) within a short time after discharge, which significantly increases the workload for medical staff. Early identification of such patients is crucial for helping physicians focus on treating life-threatening cases. In this study, we obtained Electronic Health Records (EHRs) of 3,210 encounters from 13 affiliated ERs within the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center between March 2020 and January 2021. We leveraged a Natural Language Processing technique, ScispaCy, to extract clinical concepts and used the 1001 most frequent concepts to develop 7-day revisit models for COVID-19 patients in ERs. The research data we collected from 13 ERs may have distributional differences that could affect the model development. To address this issue, we employed a classic deep transfer learning method called the Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) and evaluated different modeling strategies, including the Multi-DANN algorithm, the Single-DANN algorithm, and three baseline methods. Results showed that the Multi-DANN models outperformed the Single-DANN models and baseline models in predicting revisits of COVID-19 patients to the ER within 7 days after discharge. Notably, the Multi-DANN strategy effectively addressed the heterogeneity among multiple source domains and improved the adaptation of source data to the target domain. Moreover, the high performance of Multi-DANN models indicates that EHRs are informative for developing a prediction model to identify COVID-19 patients who are very likely to revisit an ER within 7 days after discharge.

In this paper, we aim to speed up the convergence and enhance the resilience of state estimation and tracking using a simple hierarchical system architecture wherein agents are clusters into smaller networks, and a parameter server exists to aid the information exchanges among networks. The information exchange among networks is expensive and occurs only once in a while. We propose two consensus + innovation algorithms for the state estimation and tracking problems, respectively. In both algorithms, we use a novel hierarchical push-sum consensus component. For the state estimation, we use dual averaging as the local innovation component. State tracking is much harder to tackle in the presence of dropping-link failures and the standard integration of the consensus and innovation approaches are no longer applicable. Moreover, dual averaging is no longer feasible. Our algorithm introduces a pair of additional variables per link and ensure the relevant local variables evolve according to the state dynamics, and use projected local gradient descent as the local innovation component. We also characterize the convergence rates of both of the algorithms under linear local observation model and minimal technical assumptions. We numerically validate our algorithm through simulation of both state estimation and tracking problems. ",

    "abstract": "Despite great successes, model predictive control (MPC) relies on an accurate dynamical model and requires high onboard computational power, impeding its wider adoption in engineering systems, especially for nonlinear real-time systems with limited computation power. These shortcomings of MPC motivate this work to make such a control framework more practically viable for real-world applications. Specifically, to remove the required accurate dynamical model and reduce the computational cost for nonlinear MPC (NMPC), this paper develops a unified online data-driven predictive control pipeline to efficiently control a system with guaranteed safety without incurring large computational complexity. The new aspect of this idea is learning not only the real system but also the control policy, which results in a reasonable computational cost for the data-driven predictive controllers. More specifically, we first develop a spatial temporal filter (STF)-based concurrent learning scheme to systematically identify system dynamics for general nonlinear systems. We then develop a robust control barrier function (RCBF) for safety guarantees in the presence of model uncertainties and learn the RCBF-based NMPC policy. Furthermore, to mitigate the performance degradation due to the existing model uncertainties, we propose an online policy correction scheme through perturbation analysis and design of an ancillary feedback controller. Finally, extensive simulations on two applications, cart-inverted pendulum and automotive powertrain control, are performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, which shows comparable performance with much lower computational cost in comparison with several benchmark algorithms.

Our computational results show that our approach finds better lower bounds than CVRPSEP for large-scale problems with 400 or more customers, while CVRPSEP shows strong competency for problems with less than 400 customers.

In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to address this problem by creating synthesized training data using Augmented Reality and Generative Adversarial Network. This method creates synthesized dataset that is capable of training or fine-tuning a roadside perception detector which is robust to different weather and lighting conditions, or to adapt a new deployment location. We validate our approach at two intersections: Mcity intersection and State St/Ellsworth Rd roundabout. Our experiments show that (1) the detector can achieve good performance in all conditions when trained on synthesized data only, and (2) the performance of an existing detector trained with labeled data can be enhanced by synthesized data in harsh conditions.

We introduce a training-free high quality neural matte extraction approach that specifically targets the assumptions of visual effects production. Our approach is based on the deep image prior, which optimizes a deep neural network to fit a single image, thereby providing a deep encoding of the particular image. We make use of the representations in the penultimate layer to interpolate coarse and incomplete \"trimap\" constraints. Videos processed with this approach are temporally consistent.

This is to be contrasted with the ordinary ResNet architecture which, even if the spectral norms of the weights are constrained, has a Lipschitz constant that, in the worst case, grows exponentially with the depth of the network. Further analysis of the proposed architecture shows that the spectral norms of the weights can be further constrained to ensure that the network is an averaged operator, making it a natural candidate for a learned denoiser in Plug-and-Play algorithms. Using a novel adaptive way of enforcing the spectral norm constraints, we show that, even with these constraints, it is possible to train performant networks.

    "title": "Diagnosis Uncertain Models For Medical Risk Prediction",
    "abstract": "We consider a patient risk models which has access to patient features such as vital signs, lab values, and prior history but does not have access to a patient's diagnosis. For example, this occurs in a model deployed at intake time for triage purposes. We show that such `all-cause' risk models have good generalization across diagnoses but have a predictable failure mode. When the same lab/vital/history profiles can result from diagnoses with different risk profiles (e.g. E.coli vs. MRSA) the risk estimate is a probability weighted average of these two profiles. This leads to an under-estimation of risk for rare but highly risky diagnoses. We propose a fix for this problem by explicitly modeling the uncertainty in risk prediction coming from uncertainty in patient diagnoses. This gives practitioners an interpretable way to understand patient risk beyond a single risk number. ",

This method reduces the costs and privacy concerns associated with centralized machine learning methods while ensuring data privacy by distributing training data across heterogeneous devices. On the other hand, federated learning has the drawback of data leakage due to the lack of privacy-preserving mechanisms employed during storage, transfer, and sharing, thus posing significant risks to data owners and suppliers. Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising technology for offering secure data-sharing platforms in federated learning, especially in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) settings. This survey aims to compare the performance and security of various data privacy mechanisms adopted in blockchain-based federated learning architectures. We conduct a systematic review of existing literature on secure data-sharing platforms for federated learning provided by blockchain technology, providing an in-depth overview of blockchain-based federated learning, its essential components, and discussing its principles, and potential applications. The primary contribution of this survey paper is to identify critical research questions and propose potential directions for future research in blockchain-based federated learning. ",

    "abstract": "Structural causal models (SCMs) are widely used in various disciplines to represent causal relationships among variables in complex systems. Unfortunately, the true underlying directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure is often unknown, and determining it from observational or interventional data remains a challenging task. However, in many situations, the end goal is to identify changes (shifts) in causal mechanisms between related SCMs rather than recovering the entire underlying DAG structure. Examples include analyzing gene regulatory network structure changes between healthy and cancerous individuals or understanding variations in biological pathways under different cellular contexts. This paper focuses on identifying $\\textit{functional}$ mechanism shifts in two or more related SCMs over the same set of variables -- $\\textit{without estimating the entire DAG structure of each SCM}$. Prior work under this setting assumed linear models with Gaussian noises; instead, in this work we assume that each SCM belongs to the more general class of nonlinear additive noise models (ANMs). A key contribution of this work is to show that the Jacobian of the score function for the $\\textit{mixture distribution}$ allows for identification of shifts in general non-parametric functional mechanisms. Once the shifted variables are identified, we leverage recent work to estimate the structural differences, if any, for the shifted variables. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data are provided to showcase the applicability of this approach. ",

    "abstract": "Differential privacy (DP), as a promising privacy-preserving model, has attracted great interest from researchers in recent years. Currently, the study on combination of machine learning and DP is vibrant. In contrast, another widely used artificial intelligence technique, the swarm intelligence (SI) algorithm, has received little attention in the context of DP even though it also triggers privacy concerns. For this reason, this paper attempts to combine DP and SI for the first time, and proposes a general differentially private swarm intelligence algorithm framework (DPSIAF). Based on the exponential mechanism, this framework can easily develop existing SI algorithms into the private versions. As examples, we apply the proposed DPSIAF to four popular SI algorithms, and corresponding analyses demonstrate its effectiveness. More interestingly, the experimental results show that, for our private algorithms, their performance is not strictly affected by the privacy budget, and one of the private algorithms even owns better performance than its non-private version in some cases. These findings are different from the conventional cognition, which indicates the uniqueness of SI with DP. Our study may provide a new perspective on DP, and promote the synergy between metaheuristic optimization community and privacy computing community. ",

    "abstract": "Survival prediction based on whole slide images (WSIs) is a challenging task for patient-level multiple instance learning (MIL). Due to the vast amount of data for a patient (one or multiple gigapixels WSIs) and the irregularly shaped property of WSI, it is difficult to fully explore spatial, contextual, and hierarchical interaction in the patient-level bag. Many studies adopt random sampling pre-processing strategy and WSI-level aggregation models, which inevitably lose critical prognostic information in the patient-level bag. In this work, we propose a hierarchical vision Transformer framework named HVTSurv, which can encode the local-level relative spatial information, strengthen WSI-level context-aware communication, and establish patient-level hierarchical interaction. Firstly, we design a feature pre-processing strategy, including feature rearrangement and random window masking. Then, we devise three layers to progressively obtain patient-level representation, including a local-level interaction layer adopting Manhattan distance, a WSI-level interaction layer employing spatial shuffle, and a patient-level interaction layer using attention pooling. Moreover, the design of hierarchical network helps the model become more computationally efficient. Finally, we validate HVTSurv with 3,104 patients and 3,752 WSIs across 6 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The average C-Index is 2.50-11.30% higher than all the prior weakly supervised methods over 6 TCGA datasets. Ablation study and attention visualization further verify the superiority of the proposed HVTSurv. Implementation is available at: https://github.com/szc19990412/HVTSurv. ",

As robots for social mediation gain traction in the field of human-human-robot interaction, their ability to \"understand\" the humans in their environments becomes crucial. This objective requires models of human understanding that consider multiple humans in an interaction as a collective entity and represent the group dynamics that exist among its members. Group dynamics are defined as the influential actions, processes, and changes that occur within and between group interactants. Since an individual's behavior may be deeply influenced by their interactions with other group members, the social dynamics existing within a group can influence the behaviors, attitudes, and opinions of each individual and the group as a whole. Therefore, models of group dynamics are critical for a social mediator robot to be effective in its role. In this paper, we survey existing models of group dynamics and categorize them into models of social dominance, affect, social cohesion, conflict resolution, and engagement. We highlight the multimodal features these models utilize, and emphasize the importance of capturing the interpersonal aspects of a social interaction. Finally, we make a case for models of relational affect as an approach that may be able to capture a representation of human-human interactions that can be useful for social mediation. ",

To address complex social relationships in the real world, it is crucial to consider the actual needs and consequences of the situations found therein. This includes understanding when a mediator is necessary, what specific role such a robot could play, and how it moderates human social dynamics. In this paper, we discuss six relevant roles for robotic mediators that we identified by investigating a collection of videos showing realistic group situations. We further discuss mediation behaviors and target measures to evaluate the success of such interventions. We hope that our findings can inspire future research on robot-assisted social mediation by highlighting a wider set of mediation applications than those found in prior studies.

First, a convex mathematical model for W2H-LCCI is proposed, and then optimization models for its real-time decision-making are developed, which are mixed-integer convex programs (MICPs). Furthermore, since this large-scale MICP problem must be solved in real-time, a fast solution method based on active constraint and integer variable prediction (ACIVP) is presented. ACIVP method predicts the binary variable values and the set of limited-number constraints, which most likely contain all of the active constraints, based on historical optimization data. It results in only a small-scale continuous convex optimization problem needing to be solved by optimization solvers for W2H-LCCI real-time optimal operation. To increase the accuracy of the ACIVP method, feature space expansion (FSE) is employed, and a multi-stage ACIVP-FSE method is proposed. The effects of stage design and stage ordering on ACIVP-FSE performance are also discussed. We validate the effectiveness of the developed system and solution method using two water-energy nexus case studies. ",

Furthermore, current methodologies tend to disregard the importance of the invertibility of observable functions, which leads to inaccurate results. To address these challenges, we propose the so-called FlowDMD, a Flow-based Dynamic Mode Decomposition that utilizes the Coupling Flow Invertible Neural Network (CF-INN) framework. FlowDMD leverages the intrinsically invertible characteristics of the CF-INN to learn the invariant subspaces of the Koopman operator and accurately reconstruct state variables.

    "abstract": "As malicious actors employ increasingly advanced and widespread bots to disseminate misinformation and manipulate public opinion, the detection of Twitter bots has become a crucial task. Though graph-based Twitter bot detection methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, we find that their inference depends on the neighbor users multi-hop away from the targets, and fetching neighbors is time-consuming and may introduce bias. At the same time, we find that after finetuning on Twitter bot detection, pretrained language models achieve competitive performance and do not require a graph structure during deployment. Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel bot detection framework LMBot that distills the knowledge of graph neural networks (GNNs) into language models (LMs) for graph-less deployment in Twitter bot detection to combat the challenge of data dependency. Moreover, LMBot is compatible with graph-based and graph-less datasets. Specifically, we first represent each user as a textual sequence and feed them into the LM for domain adaptation. For graph-based datasets, the output of LMs provides input features for the GNN, enabling it to optimize for bot detection and distill knowledge back to the LM in an iterative, mutually enhancing process. Armed with the LM, we can perform graph-less inference, which resolves the graph data dependency and sampling bias issues. For datasets without graph structure, we simply replace the GNN with an MLP, which has also shown strong performance. Our experiments demonstrate that LMBot achieves state-of-the-art performance on four Twitter bot detection benchmarks. Extensive studies also show that LMBot is more robust, versatile, and efficient compared to graph-based Twitter bot detection methods. ",

In previous works, the RL-based controller was typically implemented as a single neural network with concatenated observation input. However, the corresponding learned policy is highly task-specific. Since all motors are controlled in a centralized way, out-of-distribution local observations can impact global motors through the single coupled neural network policy. In contrast, animals and humans can control their limbs separately. Inspired by this biological phenomenon, we propose a Decentralized motor skill (DEMOS) learning algorithm to automatically discover motor groups that can be decoupled from each other while preserving essential connections and then learn a decentralized motor control policy. Our method improves the robustness and generalization of the policy without sacrificing performance. Experiments on quadruped and humanoid robots demonstrate that the learned policy is robust against local motor malfunctions and can be transferred to new tasks. ",

    "abstract": "After three decades of computational multibody system (MBS) dynamics, current research is centered at the development of compact and user friendly yet computationally efficient formulations for the analysis of complex MBS. The key to this is a holistic geometric approach to the kinematics modeling observing that the general motion of rigid bodies as well as the relative motion due to technical joints are screw motions. Moreover, screw theory provides the geometric setting and Lie group theory the analytic foundation for an intuitive and compact MBS modeling. The inherent frame invariance of this modeling approach gives rise to very efficient recursive $O\\left( n\\right) $ algorithms, for which the so-called 'spatial operator algebra' is one example, and allows for use of readily available geometric data. In this paper three variants for describing the configuration of tree-topology MBS in terms of relative coordinates, i.e. joint variables, are presented: the standard formulation using body-fixed joint frames, a formulation without joint frames, and a formulation without either joint or body-fixed reference frames. This allows for describing the MBS kinematics without introducing joint reference frames and therewith rendering the use of restrictive modeling convention, such as Denavit-Hartenberg parameters, redundant. Four different definitions of twists are recalled and the corresponding recursive expressions are derived. The corresponding Jacobians and their factorization are derived. The aim of this paper is to motivate the use of Lie group modeling and to provide a review of the different formulations for the kinematics of tree-topology MBS in terms of relative (joint) coordinates from the unifying perspective of screw and Lie group theory.

Unlike other recommendation scenarios, short video recommendation systems heavily rely on feedback from watch time. Existing approaches simply treat watch time as a direct label, failing to effectively harness its extensive semantics and introduce bias, thereby limiting the potential for modeling user interests based on watch time. To overcome this challenge, we propose a framework named Debiasied Multiple-semantics-extracting Labeling (DML). DML constructs labels that encompass various semantics by utilizing quantiles derived from the distribution of watch time, prioritizing relative order rather than absolute label values. This approach facilitates easier model learning while aligning with the ranking objective of recommendations. Furthermore, we introduce a method inspired by causal adjustment to refine label definitions, thereby reducing the impact of bias on the label and directly mitigating bias at the label level. We substantiate the effectiveness of our DML framework through both online and offline experiments. Extensive results demonstrate that our DML could effectively leverage watch time to discover users' real interests, enhancing their engagement in our application. ",

Different with existing methods adding perturbation to original images, we propose to jointly tune adversarial exposure and additive perturbation for attack and constrain image close to cloudy image as Adversarial Cloud. Cloud is natural and common in remote sensing images, however, camouflaging cloud based adversarial attack and defense for remote sensing images are not well studied before. Furthermore, we design DefenseNet as a learn-able pre-processing to the adversarial cloudy images so as to preserve the performance of the deep learning based remote sensing SOD model, without tuning the already deployed deep SOD model. By considering both regular and generalized adversarial examples, the proposed DefenseNet can defend the proposed Adversarial Cloud in white-box setting and other attack methods in black-box setting.

Our studies show that a backdoor model is usually optimized to a bad local minima, i.e. sharper minima as compared to a benign model. Intuitively, a backdoor model can be purified by reoptimizing the model to a smoother minima through fine-tuning with a few clean validation data. However, fine-tuning all DNN parameters often requires huge computational costs and often results in sub-par clean test performance. To address this concern, we propose a novel backdoor purification technique, Natural Gradient Fine-tuning (NGF), which focuses on removing the backdoor by fine-tuning only one layer. Specifically, NGF utilizes a loss surface geometry-aware optimizer that can successfully overcome the challenge of reaching a smooth minima under a one-layer optimization scenario. To enhance the generalization performance of our proposed method, we introduce a clean data distribution-aware regularizer based on the knowledge of loss surface curvature matrix, i.e., Fisher Information Matrix. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of backdoor defense benchmarks: four different datasets- CIFAR10, GTSRB, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet; 13 recent backdoor attacks, e.g. Blend, Dynamic, WaNet, ISSBA, etc. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer the highest performance in a wide range of applications in computer vision. These results rely on over-parameterized backbones, which are expensive to run. This computational burden can be dramatically reduced by quantizing (in either data-free (DFQ), post-training (PTQ) or quantization-aware training (QAT) scenarios) floating point values to ternary values (2 bits, with each weight taking value in {-1,0,1}). In this context, we observe that rounding to nearest minimizes the expected error given a uniform distribution and thus does not account for the skewness and kurtosis of the weight distribution, which strongly affects ternary quantization performance. This raises the following question: shall one minimize the highest or average quantization error? To answer this, we design two operators: TQuant and MQuant that correspond to these respective minimization tasks. We show experimentally that our approach allows to significantly improve the performance of ternary quantization through a variety of scenarios in DFQ, PTQ and QAT and give strong insights to pave the way for future research in deep neural network quantization.

The presented approach considers the robot motion to be subject to process noise bounded by ellipsoidal sets. In order to efficiently handle the evolution of the disturbance ellipsoids within the MPC, the zero-order robust optimization (zoRO) scheme is applied. The idea is to fix the disturbance ellipsoids within one optimization iteration and solve the problem repeatedly with updated disturbance ellipsoid trajectories. The zero-order approach is suboptimal in general. However, we show that it does not impair convergence to the reference trajectory in the absence of obstacles. The experiments on an industrial mobile robot prototype demonstrate the performance of the controller. ",

In light of the success of sample mining techniques in 2D object detection, we propose a simple yet effective mining strategy for improving depth perception in 3D object detection. Concretely, we introduce a plain metric to evaluate the quality of depth predictions, which chooses the mined sample for the model. Moreover, we propose a Gradient-aware and Model-perceive Mining strategy (GMM) for depth learning, which exploits the predicted depth quality for better depth learning through easy mining. GMM is a general strategy that can be readily applied to several state-of-the-art monocular 3D detectors, improving the accuracy of depth prediction. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve the performance of 3D object detection while outperforming other state-of-the-art sample mining techniques by a considerable margin. On the nuScenes benchmark, GMM achieved the state-of-the-art (42.1% mAP and 47.3% NDS) performance in monocular object detection. ",

While research has focused on improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving, it's also crucial to consider collaboration between AVs and HVs. Human-like interaction is a required capability for AVs, especially at common unsignalized intersections, as human drivers of HVs expect to maintain their driving habits for inter-vehicle interactions. This paper uses the social value orientation (SVO) in the decision-making of vehicles to describe the social interaction among multiple vehicles. Specifically, we define the quantitative calculation of the conflict-involved SVO at unsignalized intersections to enhance decision-making based on the reinforcement learning method. We use naturalistic driving scenarios with highly interactive motions for performance evaluation of the proposed method. Experimental results show that SVO is more effective in characterizing inter-vehicle interactions than conventional motion state parameters like velocity, and the proposed method can accurately reproduce naturalistic driving trajectories compared to behavior cloning.

To deal with the problem of insufficient speaker-to-text annotations, we created a new annotation dataset Manga109Dialog based on Manga109. Manga109Dialog is the world's largest comics speaker annotation dataset, containing 132,692 speaker-to-text pairs.

Due to the unique features of comics, we enhance the performance of our proposed model by considering the frame reading order. We conducted experiments using Manga109Dialog and other datasets.

They should have high efficiency and low latency while reducing computational complexity. Currently, the most commonly used algorithms are based on deep neural networks, which guarantee high efficiency but require high-performance computing platforms. In the case of autonomous vehicles, i.e. cars, but also drones, it is necessary to use embedded platforms with limited computing power, which makes it difficult to meet the requirements described above. A reduction in the complexity of the network can be achieved by using an appropriate: architecture, representation (reduced numerical precision, quantisation, pruning), and computing platform. In this paper, we focus on the first factor - the use of so-called detection-segmentation networks as a component of a perception system. We considered the task of segmenting the drivable area and road markings in combination with the detection of selected objects (pedestrians, traffic lights, and obstacles). We compared the performance of three different architectures described in the literature: MultiTask V3, HybridNets, and YOLOP. We conducted the experiments on a custom dataset consisting of approximately 500 images of the drivable area and lane markings, and 250 images of detected objects. Of the three methods analysed, MultiTask V3 proved to be the best, achieving 99% mAP_50 for detection, 97% MIoU for drivable area segmentation, and 91% MIoU for lane segmentation, as well as 124 fps on the RTX 3060 graphics card. This architecture is a good solution for embedded perception systems for autonomous vehicles. The code is available at: https://github.com/vision-agh/MMAR_2023. ",

Yet, with the high complexity of many contemporary issues, such as global warming and migration, our means of information need to mutually adapt. Narrative has always been at the core of information exchange - regardless of whether our ancestors sat around a fire and exchanged stories, or whether we read an article in a newspaper, or watched a TV news broadcast. Yet, the narrative formats of the newspaper article, the news broadcast, the documentary, and the textbook are severely limited when it comes to representing highly complex topics which may include several competing - and sometimes equally valid - perspectives. Such complexity contributes to a high level of uncertainty due to a multitude of factors affecting an outcome. Fortunately, with Interactive Digital Narrative (IDN), there is a novel media format which can address these challenges. IDNs can present several different perspectives in the same work, and give audiences the ability to explore them at will through decision-making. After experiencing the consequences of their decisions, the audience can replay to revisit and change these decisions in order to consider their alternatives. IDN works enable deep personalization and the inclusion of live data. These capabilities make IDN a 21st century democratic medium, empowering citizens through the understanding of complex issues. In this white paper, we discuss the challenge of representing complexity, describe the advantages offered by IDNs, and point out opportunities and strategies for deployment. ",

    "abstract": "We study the type of solutions to which stochastic gradient descent converges when used to train a single hidden-layer multivariate ReLU network with the quadratic loss. Our results are based on a dynamical stability analysis. In the univariate case, it was shown that linearly stable minima correspond to network functions (predictors), whose second derivative has a bounded weighted $L^1$ norm. Notably, the bound gets smaller as the step size increases, implying that training with a large step size leads to `smoother' predictors. Here we generalize this result to the multivariate case, showing that a similar result applies to the Laplacian of the predictor. We demonstrate the tightness of our bound on the MNIST dataset, and show that it accurately captures the behavior of the solutions as a function of the step size. Additionally, we prove a depth separation result on the approximation power of ReLU networks corresponding to stable minima of the loss. Specifically, although shallow ReLU networks are universal approximators, we prove that stable shallow networks are not. Namely, there is a function that cannot be well-approximated by stable single hidden-layer ReLU networks trained with a non-vanishing step size. This is while the same function can be realized as a stable two hidden-layer ReLU network. Finally, we prove that if a function is sufficiently smooth (in a Sobolev sense) then it can be approximated arbitrarily well using shallow ReLU networks that correspond to stable solutions of gradient descent.

In this work we investigate whether a prior map can be leveraged to aid in the detection of dynamic objects in a scene without the need for a 3D map or pixel-level map-query correspondences. We contribute an algorithm which refines an initial set of candidate object detections and produces a refined subset of highly accurate detections using a prior map. We begin by using visual place recognition (VPR) to retrieve a reference map image for a given query image, then use a binary classification neural network that compares the query and mapping image regions to validate the query detection. Once our classification network is trained, on approximately 1000 query-map image pairs, it is able to improve the performance of vehicle detection when combined with an existing off-the-shelf vehicle detector. We demonstrate our approach using standard datasets across two cities (Oxford and Zurich) under different settings of train-test separation of map-query traverse pairs. We further emphasize the performance gains of our approach against alternative design choices and show that VPR suffices for the task, eliminating the need for precise ground truth localization. ",

In real-world scenarios, however, we are met with challenging visual conditions, coarticulated signing, small datasets, and the need for signer independent models. To tackle this difficult problem, we require a robust feature extractor to process the sign language videos. One could expect human pose estimators to be ideal candidates. However, due to a domain mismatch with their training sets and challenging poses in sign language, they lack robustness on sign language data and image based models often still outperform keypoint based models. Furthermore, whereas the common practice of transfer learning with image based models yields even higher accuracy, keypoint based models are typically trained from scratch on every SLR dataset. These factors limit their usefulness for SLR. From the existing literature, it is also not clear which, if any, pose estimator performs best for SLR. We compare the three most popular pose estimators for SLR: OpenPose, MMPose and MediaPipe. We show that through keypoint normalization, missing keypoint imputation, and learning a pose embedding, we can obtain significantly better results and enable transfer learning. We show that keypoint-based embeddings contain cross-lingual features: they can transfer between sign languages and achieve competitive performance even when fine-tuning only the classifier layer of an SLR model on a target sign language. We furthermore achieve better performance using fine-tuned transferred embeddings than models trained only on the target sign language. The application of these embeddings could prove particularly useful for low resource sign languages in the future. ",

However, 3D human action recognition is a challenging task due to the irregularity and Disarrangement of the data points in action sequences. In this context, we present our novel model for human action recognition from fixed topology mesh sequences based on Spiral Auto-encoder and Transformer Network, namely SpATr. The proposed method first disentangles space and time in the mesh sequences. Then, an auto-encoder is utilized to extract spatial geometrical features, and tiny transformer is used to capture the temporal evolution of the sequence. Previous methods either use 2D depth images, sample skeletons points or they require a huge amount of memory leading to the ability to process short sequences only. In this work, we show competitive recognition rate and high memory efficiency by building our auto-encoder based on spiral convolutions, which are light weight convolution directly applied to mesh data with fixed topologies, and by modeling temporal evolution using a attention, that can handle large sequences. The proposed method is evaluated on on two 3D human action datasets: MoVi and BMLrub from the Archive of Motion Capture As Surface Shapes (AMASS). The results analysis shows the effectiveness of our method in 3D human action recognition while maintaining high memory efficiency. The code will soon be made publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "The event streams generated by dynamic vision sensors (DVS) are sparse and non-uniform in the spatial domain, while still dense and redundant in the temporal domain. Although spiking neural network (SNN), the event-driven neuromorphic model, has the potential to extract spatio-temporal features from the event streams, it is not effective and efficient. Based on the above, we propose an events sparsification spiking framework dubbed as Razor SNN, pruning pointless event frames progressively. Concretely, we extend the dynamic mechanism based on the global temporal embeddings, reconstruct the features, and emphasize the events effect adaptively at the training stage. During the inference stage, eliminate fruitless frames hierarchically according to a binary mask generated by the trained temporal embeddings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our Razor SNN achieves competitive performance consistently on four events-based benchmarks: DVS 128 Gesture, N-Caltech 101, CIFAR10-DVS and SHD. ",

    "abstract": "Generating learning-friendly representations for points in space is a fundamental and long-standing problem in ML. Recently, multi-scale encoding schemes (such as Space2Vec and NeRF) were proposed to directly encode any point in 2D/3D Euclidean space as a high-dimensional vector, and has been successfully applied to various geospatial prediction and generative tasks. However, all current 2D and 3D location encoders are designed to model point distances in Euclidean space. So when applied to large-scale real-world GPS coordinate datasets, which require distance metric learning on the spherical surface, both types of models can fail due to the map projection distortion problem (2D) and the spherical-to-Euclidean distance approximation error (3D). To solve these problems, we propose a multi-scale location encoder called Sphere2Vec which can preserve spherical distances when encoding point coordinates on a spherical surface. We developed a unified view of distance-reserving encoding on spheres based on the DFS. We also provide theoretical proof that the Sphere2Vec preserves the spherical surface distance between any two points, while existing encoding schemes do not. Experiments on 20 synthetic datasets show that Sphere2Vec can outperform all baseline models on all these datasets with up to 30.8% error rate reduction. We then apply Sphere2Vec to three geo-aware image classification tasks - fine-grained species recognition, Flickr image recognition, and remote sensing image classification. Results on 7 real-world datasets show the superiority of Sphere2Vec over multiple location encoders on all three tasks. Further analysis shows that Sphere2Vec outperforms other location encoder models, especially in the polar regions and data-sparse areas because of its nature for spherical surface distance preservation.

    "abstract": "Neural scene reconstruction methods have achieved impressive performance in reconstructing complex geometry and low-textured regions in large scenes. However, these methods heavily rely on 3D supervised information which is costly and time-consuming to obtain in the real world. In this paper, we propose a novel neural reconstruction method that reconstructs scenes without 3D supervision. We perform differentiable volume rendering for scene reconstruction by using accessible 2D images as supervision. We impose geometry to improve the reconstruction quality of complex geometry regions in the scenes, and impose plane constraints to improve the reconstruction quality of low-textured regions in the scenes. Specifically, we introduce a signed distance function (SDF) field, a color field, and a probability field to represent the scene, and optimize the fields under the differentiable ray marching to reconstruct the scene. Besides, we impose geometric constraints that project 3D points on the surface to similar-looking regions with similar features in different views. We also impose plane constraints to make large planes keep parallel or vertical to the wall or floor. These two constraints help to reconstruct accurate and smooth geometry structures of the scene. Without 3D supervision information, our method achieves competitive reconstruction compared with some existing methods that use 3D information as supervision on the ScanNet dataset. ",

To address this issue, we propose the Clause Feature Correlation Decoupling and Coupling (CFCDC) model, which uses a feature representation decoupling method to separate the SELECT and WHERE clauses at the parameter level. Next, we introduce a multi-task learning architecture to decouple implicit correlation feature representation between different SQL tasks in a specific clause.

This is often achieved by concatenating meaningful biomedical morphemes to create new semantic units. Nevertheless, most modern biomedical language models (LMs) are pre-trained using standard domain-specific tokenizers derived from large scale biomedical corpus statistics without explicitly leveraging the agglutinating nature of biomedical language. In this work, we first find that standard open-domain and biomedical tokenizers are largely unable to segment biomedical terms into meaningful components. Therefore, we hypothesize that using a tokenizer which segments biomedical terminology more accurately would enable biomedical LMs to improve their performance on downstream biomedical NLP tasks, especially ones which involve biomedical terms directly such as named entity recognition (NER) and entity linking. Surprisingly, we find that pre-training a biomedical LM using a more accurate biomedical tokenizer does not improve the entity representation quality of a language model as measured by several intrinsic and extrinsic measures such as masked language modeling prediction (MLM) accuracy as well as NER and entity linking performance. These quantitative findings, along with a case study which explores entity representation quality more directly, suggest that the biomedical pre-training process is quite robust to instances of sub-optimal tokenization.

In this paper, we attempt to explore the potential of the object-level VLPM, Grounded Language-Image Pre-training (GLIP) model, for zero-shot nuclei detection. Concretely, an automatic prompts design pipeline is devised based on the association binding trait of VLPM and the image-to-text VLPM BLIP, avoiding empirical manual prompts engineering. We further establish a self-training framework, using the automatically designed prompts to generate the preliminary results as pseudo labels from GLIP and refine the predicted boxes in an iterative manner. Our method achieves a remarkable performance for label-free nuclei detection, surpassing other comparison methods.

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising research direction for building power-efficient information processing systems, especially for temporal tasks such as speech recognition. In SNNs, delays refer to the time needed for one spike to travel from one neuron to another. These delays matter because they influence the spike arrival times, and it is well-known that spiking neurons respond more strongly to coincident input spikes. More formally, it has been shown theoretically that plastic delays greatly increase the expressivity in SNNs. Yet, efficient algorithms to learn these delays have been lacking. Here, we propose a new discrete-time algorithm that addresses this issue in deep feedforward SNNs using backpropagation, in an offline manner. To simulate delays between consecutive layers, we use 1D convolutions across time. The kernels contain only a few non-zero weights - one per synapse - whose positions correspond to the delays. These positions are learned together with the weights using the recently proposed Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings (DCLS). We evaluated our method on the Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD) and the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) benchmarks, which require detecting temporal patterns. We used feedforward SNNs with two hidden fully connected layers. We showed that fixed random delays help, and that learning them helps even more. Furthermore, our method outperformed the state-of-the-art in both SHD and SSC without using recurrent connections and with substantially fewer parameters. Our work demonstrates the potential of delay learning in developing accurate and precise models for temporal data processing.

Such subexponential parameterized algorithms are known to exist in planar and even $H$-minor free graphs from bidimensionality theory [Demaine et al., JACM 2005], and there is a recent line of work lifting these results to geometric graph classes consisting of intersection of \"fat\" objects ([Grigoriev et al., FOCS 2022] and [Lokshtanov et al., SODA 2022]). In this paper we focus on \"thin\" objects by considering intersection graphs of segments in the plane with $d$ possible slopes ($d$-DIR graphs) and contact graphs of segments in the plane. Assuming the ETH, we rule out the existence of algorithms: - solving TH in time $2^{o(n)}$ in 2-DIR graphs; and - solving TH, FVS, and OCT in time $2^{o(\\sqrt{n})}$ in $K_{2,2}$-free contact 2-DIR graphs.

By customizing intention queries for distinct motion modalities, MTR improves multimodal motion prediction while reducing reliance on dense goal candidates. The framework comprises two essential processes: global intention localization, identifying the agent's intent to enhance overall efficiency, and local movement refinement, adaptively refining predicted trajectories for improved accuracy. Moreover, we introduce an advanced MTR++ framework, extending the capability of MTR to simultaneously predict multimodal motion for multiple agents. MTR++ incorporates symmetric context modeling and mutually-guided intention querying modules to facilitate future behavior interaction among multiple agents, resulting in scene-compliant future trajectories. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the MTR framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the highly-competitive motion prediction benchmarks, while the MTR++ framework surpasses its precursor, exhibiting enhanced performance and efficiency in predicting accurate multimodal future trajectories for multiple agents.

    "abstract": "Personalized cancer treatment requires a thorough understanding of complex interactions between drugs and cancer cell lines in varying genetic and molecular contexts. To address this, high-throughput screening has been used to generate large-scale drug response data, facilitating data-driven computational models. Such models can capture complex drug-cell line interactions across various contexts in a fully data-driven manner. However, accurately prioritizing the most sensitive drugs for each cell line still remains a significant challenge. To address this, we developed neural ranking approaches that leverage large-scale drug response data across multiple cell lines from diverse cancer types. Unlike existing approaches that primarily utilize regression and classification techniques for drug response prediction, we formulated the objective of drug selection and prioritization as a drug ranking problem. In this work, we proposed two neural listwise ranking methods that learn latent representations of drugs and cell lines, and then use those representations to score drugs in each cell line via a learnable scoring function. Specifically, we developed a neural listwise ranking method, List-One, on top of the existing method ListNet. Additionally, we proposed a novel listwise ranking method, List-All, that focuses on all the sensitive drugs instead of the top sensitive drug, unlike List-One. Our results demonstrate that List-All outperforms the best baseline with significant improvements of as much as 8.6% in hit@20 across 50% test cell lines. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that the learned latent spaces from our proposed methods demonstrate informative clustering structures and capture relevant underlying biological features.

    "abstract": "The proliferation of deep learning applications in healthcare calls for data aggregation across various institutions, a practice often associated with significant privacy concerns. This concern intensifies in medical image analysis, where privacy-preserving mechanisms are paramount due to the data being sensitive in nature. Federated learning, which enables cooperative model training without direct data exchange, presents a promising solution. Nevertheless, the inherent vulnerabilities of federated learning necessitate further privacy safeguards. This study addresses this need by integrating differential privacy, a leading privacy-preserving technique, into a federated learning framework for medical image classification. We introduce a novel differentially private federated learning model and meticulously examine its impacts on privacy preservation and model performance. Our research confirms the existence of a trade-off between model accuracy and privacy settings. However, we demonstrate that strategic calibration of the privacy budget in differential privacy can uphold robust image classification performance while providing substantial privacy protection. ",

    "abstract": "Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is essentially ill-posed since a noisy HSI can be degraded from multiple clean HSIs. However, current deep learning-based approaches ignore this fact and restore the clean image with deterministic mapping (i.e., the network receives a noisy HSI and outputs a clean HSI). To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a flow-based HSI denoising network (HIDFlowNet) to directly learn the conditional distribution of the clean HSI given the noisy HSI and thus diverse clean HSIs can be sampled from the conditional distribution. Overall, our HIDFlowNet is induced from the flow methodology and contains an invertible decoder and a conditional encoder, which can fully decouple the learning of low-frequency and high-frequency information of HSI. Specifically, the invertible decoder is built by staking a succession of invertible conditional blocks (ICBs) to capture the local high-frequency details since the invertible network is information-lossless. The conditional encoder utilizes down-sampling operations to obtain low-resolution images and uses transformers to capture correlations over a long distance so that global low-frequency information can be effectively extracted. Extensive experimental results on simulated and real HSI datasets verify the superiority of our proposed HIDFlowNet compared with other state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually. ",

    "abstract": "Age estimation of face images is a crucial task with various practical applications in areas such as video surveillance and Internet access control. While deep learning-based age estimation frameworks, e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN), multi-layer perceptrons (MLP), and transformers have shown remarkable performance, they have limitations when modelling complex or irregular objects in an image that contains a large amount of redundant information. To address this issue, this paper utilizes the robustness property of graph representation learning in dealing with image redundancy information and proposes a novel Masked Contrastive Graph Representation Learning (MCGRL) method for age estimation. Specifically, our approach first leverages CNN to extract semantic features of the image, which are then partitioned into patches that serve as nodes in the graph. Then, we use a masked graph convolutional network (GCN) to derive image-based node representations that capture rich structural information. Finally, we incorporate multiple losses to explore the complementary relationship between structural information and semantic features, which improves the feature representation capability of GCN. Experimental results on real-world face image datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over other state-of-the-art age estimation approaches. ",

In a common formulation of this problem, a designer sequentially attempts candidate solutions, receiving noisy feedback on the value of each attempt from the system. In this paper, we study scenarios in which feedback is also provided on the safety of the attempted solution, and the optimizer is constrained to limit the number of unsafe solutions that are tried throughout the optimization process. Focusing on methods based on Bayesian optimization (BO), prior art has introduced an optimization scheme -- referred to as SAFEOPT -- that is guaranteed not to select any unsafe solution with a controllable probability over feedback noise as long as strict assumptions on the safety constraint function are met. In this paper, a novel BO-based approach is introduced that satisfies safety requirements irrespective of properties of the constraint function. This strong theoretical guarantee is obtained at the cost of allowing for an arbitrary, controllable but non-zero, rate of violation of the safety constraint. The proposed method, referred to as SAFE-BOCP, builds on online conformal prediction (CP) and is specialized to the cases in which feedback on the safety constraint is either noiseless or noisy. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data validate the advantages and flexibility of the proposed SAFE-BOCP. ",

    "abstract": "3D perceptual representations are well suited for robot manipulation as they easily encode occlusions and simplify spatial reasoning. Many manipulation tasks require high spatial precision in end-effector pose prediction, typically demanding high-resolution 3D perceptual grids that are computationally expensive to process. As a result, most manipulation policies operate directly in 2D, foregoing 3D inductive biases. In this paper, we propose Act3D, a manipulation policy Transformer that casts 6-DoF keypose prediction as 3D detection with adaptive spatial computation. It takes as input 3D feature clouds unprojected from one or more camera views, iteratively samples 3D point grids in free space in a coarse-to-fine manner, featurizes them using relative spatial attention to the physical feature cloud, and selects the best feature point for end-effector pose prediction. Act3D sets a new state-of-the-art in RLbench, an established manipulation benchmark. Our model achieves 10% absolute improvement over the previous SOTA 2D multi-view policy on 74 RLbench tasks and 22% absolute improvement with 3x less compute over the previous SOTA 3D policy. In thorough ablations, we show the importance of relative spatial attention, large-scale vision-language pre-trained 2D backbones, and weight tying across coarse-to-fine attentions.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the application of FL to object detection as a method to enhance generalizability, and to compare its performance against a centralized training approach for an object detection algorithm. Specifically, we investigate the performance of a YOLOv5 model trained using FL across multiple clients and employ a random sampling strategy without replacement, so each client holds a portion of the same dataset used for centralized training. Our experimental results showcase the superior efficiency of the FL object detector's global model in generating accurate bounding boxes for unseen objects, with the test set being a mixture of objects from two distinct clients not represented in the training dataset. These findings suggest that FL can be viewed from an ensemble algorithm perspective, akin to a synergistic blend of Bagging and Boosting techniques. As a result, FL can be seen not only as a method to enhance privacy, but also as a method to enhance the performance of a machine learning model. ",

Using modular addition as a prototypical problem, we show that algorithm discovery in neural networks is sometimes more complex. Small changes to model hyperparameters and initializations can induce the discovery of qualitatively different algorithms from a fixed training set, and even parallel implementations of multiple such algorithms. Some networks trained to perform modular addition implement a familiar Clock algorithm; others implement a previously undescribed, less intuitive, but comprehensible procedure which we term the Pizza algorithm, or a variety of even more complex procedures. Our results show that even simple learning problems can admit a surprising diversity of solutions, motivating the development of new tools for characterizing the behavior of neural networks across their algorithmic phase space.

A vertex $v \\in V(G)$ is shedding if for every independent set $S \\subseteq V(G) \\setminus N[v]$ there exists $u \\in N(v)$ such that $S \\cup \\{u\\}$ is independent. An independent set $S$ is maximal if it is not contained in another independent set. An independent set $S$ is maximum if the size of every independent set of $G$ is not bigger than $|S|$. The size of a maximum independent set of $G$ is denoted $\\alpha(G)$. A graph $G$ is well-covered if all its maximal independent sets are maximum, i.e. the size of every maximal independent set is $\\alpha(G)$. The graph $G$ belongs to class $\\mathbf{W_2}$ if every two pairwise disjoint independent sets in $G$ are included in two pairwise disjoint maximum independent sets. If a graph belongs to the class $\\mathbf{W_2}$ then it is well-covered. Finding a maximum independent set in an input graph is an NP-complete problem. Recognizing well-covered graphs is co-NP-complete. The complexity status of deciding whether an input graph belongs to the $\\mathbf{W_2}$ class is not known. Even when the input is restricted to well-covered graphs, the complexity status of recognizing graphs in $\\mathbf{W_2}$ is not known. In this article, we investigate the connection between shedding vertices and $\\mathbf{W_2}$ graphs. On the one hand, we prove that recognizing shedding vertices is co-NP-complete.
