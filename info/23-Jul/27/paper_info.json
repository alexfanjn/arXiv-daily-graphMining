    "abstract": "Discovering a high-performing sparse network within a massive neural network is advantageous for deploying them on devices with limited storage, such as mobile phones. Additionally, model explainability is essential to fostering trust in AI. The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) finds a network within a deep network with comparable or superior performance to the original model. However, limited study has been conducted on the success or failure of LTH in terms of explainability. In this work, we examine why the performance of the pruned networks gradually increases or decreases. Using Grad-CAM and Post-hoc concept bottleneck models (PCBMs), respectively, we investigate the explainability of pruned networks in terms of pixels and high-level concepts. We perform extensive experiments across vision and medical imaging datasets. As more weights are pruned, the performance of the network degrades. The discovered concepts and pixels from the pruned networks are inconsistent with the original network -- a possible reason for the drop in performance. ",

    "abstract": "To answer complex queries on knowledge graphs, logical reasoning over incomplete knowledge is required due to the open-world assumption. Learning-based methods are essential because they are capable of generalizing over unobserved knowledge. Therefore, an appropriate dataset is fundamental to both obtaining and evaluating such methods under this paradigm. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for data generation, model training, and method evaluation that covers the combinatorial space of Existential First-order Queries with multiple variables ($\\text{EFO}_{k}$). The combinatorial query space in our framework significantly extends those defined by set operations in the existing literature. Additionally, we construct a dataset, $\\text{EFO}_{k}$-CQA, with 741 types of query for empirical evaluation, and our benchmark results provide new insights into how query hardness affects the results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the existing dataset construction process is systematically biased that hinders the appropriate development of query-answering methods, highlighting the importance of our work.

    "abstract": "Automatic Emotion Detection (ED) aims to build systems to identify users' emotions automatically. This field has the potential to enhance HCI, creating an individualised experience for the user. However, ED systems tend to perform poorly on people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Hence, the need to create ED systems tailored to how people with autism express emotions. Previous works have created ED systems tailored for children with ASD but did not share the resulting dataset. Sharing annotated datasets is essential to enable the development of more advanced computer models for ED within the research community. In this paper, we describe our experience establishing a process to create a multimodal annotated dataset featuring children with a level 1 diagnosis of autism. In addition, we introduce CALMED (Children, Autism, Multimodal, Emotion, Detection), the resulting multimodal emotion detection dataset featuring children with autism aged 8-12. CALMED includes audio and video features extracted from recording files of study sessions with participants, together with annotations provided by their parents into four target classes. The generated dataset includes a total of 57,012 examples, with each example representing a time window of 200ms (0.2s). Our experience and methods described here, together with the dataset shared, aim to contribute to future research applications of affective computing in ASD, which has the potential to create systems to improve the lives of people with ASD.

    "abstract": "Quasi-Newton methods still face significant challenges in training large-scale neural networks due to additional compute costs in the Hessian related computations and instability issues in stochastic training. A well-known method, L-BFGS that efficiently approximates the Hessian using history parameter and gradient changes, suffers convergence instability in stochastic training. So far, attempts that adapt L-BFGS to large-scale stochastic training incur considerable extra overhead, which offsets its convergence benefits in wall-clock time. In this paper, we propose mL-BFGS, a lightweight momentum-based L-BFGS algorithm that paves the way for quasi-Newton (QN) methods in large-scale distributed deep neural network (DNN) optimization. mL-BFGS introduces a nearly cost-free momentum scheme into L-BFGS update and greatly reduces stochastic noise in the Hessian, therefore stabilizing convergence during stochastic optimization. For model training at a large scale, mL-BFGS approximates a block-wise Hessian, thus enabling distributing compute and memory costs across all computing nodes. We provide a supporting convergence analysis for mL-BFGS in stochastic settings. To investigate mL-BFGS potential in large-scale DNN training, we train benchmark neural models using mL-BFGS and compare performance with baselines (SGD, Adam, and other quasi-Newton methods). Results show that mL-BFGS achieves both noticeable iteration-wise and wall-clock speedup. ",

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) can incorporate limited labeled data and large amounts of unlabeled data to improve the performance and generalization of existing object detectors. Despite many advances, recent SSOD methods are still challenged by noisy/misleading pseudo-labels, classical exponential moving average (EMA) strategy, and the consensus of Teacher-Student models in the latter stages of training. This paper proposes a novel training-based model refinement (TMR) stage and a simple yet effective representation disagreement (RD) strategy to address the limitations of classical EMA and the consensus problem. The TMR stage of Teacher-Student models optimizes the lightweight scaling operation to refine the model's weights and prevent overfitting or forgetting learned patterns from unlabeled data. Meanwhile, the RD strategy helps keep these models diverged to encourage the student model to explore complementary representations. In addition, we use cascade regression to generate more reliable pseudo-labels for supervising the student model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over state-of-the-art SSOD methods. Specifically, the proposed approach outperforms the Unbiased-Teacher method by an average mAP margin of 4.6% and 5.3% when using partially-labeled and fully-labeled data on the MS-COCO dataset, respectively.

In practice this can lead to low detection rates and high false positive rates, which characterise for example anti-money laundering systems. In fact, it is estimated that 1.7--4 trillion euros are laundered annually and go undetected. We propose The GANfather, a method to generate samples with properties of malicious activity, without label requirements. We propose to reward the generation of malicious samples by introducing an extra objective to the typical Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) loss. Ultimately, our goal is to enhance the detection of illicit activity using the discriminator network as a novel and robust defence system. Optionally, we may encourage the generator to bypass pre-existing detection systems. This setup then reveals defensive weaknesses for the discriminator to correct. We evaluate our method in two real-world use cases, money laundering and recommendation systems. In the former, our method moves cumulative amounts close to 350 thousand dollars through a network of accounts without being detected by an existing system. In the latter, we recommend the target item to a broad user base with as few as 30 synthetic attackers. In both cases, we train a new defence system to capture the synthetic attacks. ",

    "abstract": "The Random Dot Product Graph (RDPG) is a generative model for relational data, where nodes are represented via latent vectors in low-dimensional Euclidean space. RDPGs crucially postulate that edge formation probabilities are given by the dot product of the corresponding latent positions. Accordingly, the embedding task of estimating these vectors from an observed graph is typically posed as a low-rank matrix factorization problem. The workhorse Adjacency Spectral Embedding (ASE) enjoys solid statistical properties, but it is formally solving a surrogate problem and can be computationally intensive. In this paper, we bring to bear recent advances in non-convex optimization and demonstrate their impact to RDPG inference. We advocate first-order gradient descent methods to better solve the embedding problem, and to organically accommodate broader network embedding applications of practical relevance. Notably, we argue that RDPG embeddings of directed graphs loose interpretability unless the factor matrices are constrained to have orthogonal columns. We thus develop a novel feasible optimization method in the resulting manifold. The effectiveness of the graph representation learning framework is demonstrated on reproducible experiments with both synthetic and real network data. Our open-source algorithm implementations are scalable, and unlike the ASE they are robust to missing edge data and can track slowly-varying latent positions from streaming graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Waveform-based deep learning faces a dilemma between nonparametric and parametric approaches. On one hand, convolutional neural networks (convnets) may approximate any linear time-invariant system; yet, in practice, their frequency responses become more irregular as their receptive fields grow. On the other hand, a parametric model such as LEAF is guaranteed to yield Gabor filters, hence an optimal time-frequency localization; yet, this strong inductive bias comes at the detriment of representational capacity. In this paper, we aim to overcome this dilemma by introducing a neural audio model, named multiresolution neural network (MuReNN). The key idea behind MuReNN is to train separate convolutional operators over the octave subbands of a discrete wavelet transform (DWT). Since the scale of DWT atoms grows exponentially between octaves, the receptive fields of the subsequent learnable convolutions in MuReNN are dilated accordingly. For a given real-world dataset, we fit the magnitude response of MuReNN to that of a well-established auditory filterbank: Gammatone for speech, CQT for music, and third-octave for urban sounds, respectively. This is a form of knowledge distillation (KD), in which the filterbank ''teacher'' is engineered by domain knowledge while the neural network ''student'' is optimized from data. We compare MuReNN to the state of the art in terms of goodness of fit after KD on a hold-out set and in terms of Heisenberg time-frequency localization. Compared to convnets and Gabor convolutions, we find that MuReNN reaches state-of-the-art performance on all three optimization problems. ",

As a few recent works claim that ViTs for image classification also have better robustness properties, we investigate whether the improved adversarial robustness of ViTs extends to image restoration. We consider the recently proposed Restormer model, as well as NAFNet and the \"Baseline network\" which are both simplified versions of a Restormer. We use Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) and CosPGD, a recently proposed adversarial attack tailored to pixel-wise prediction tasks for our robustness evaluation. Our experiments are performed on real-world images from the GoPro dataset for image deblurring. Our analysis indicates that contrary to as advocated by ViTs in image classification works, these models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. We attempt to improve their robustness through adversarial training. While this yields a significant increase in robustness for Restormer, results on other networks are less promising. Interestingly, the design choices in NAFNet and Baselines, which were based on iid performance, and not on robust generalization, seem to be at odds with the model robustness. Thus, we investigate this further and find a fix. ",

Their success lies in the physics-informed loss, which trains a neural network to satisfy a given PDE at specific points and to approximate the solution. However, the solutions to PDEs are inherently infinite-dimensional, and the distance between the output and the solution is defined by an integral over the domain. Therefore, the physics-informed loss only provides a finite approximation, and selecting appropriate collocation points becomes crucial to suppress the discretization errors, although this aspect has often been overlooked. In this paper, we propose a new technique called good lattice training (GLT) for PINNs, inspired by number theoretic methods for numerical analysis. GLT offers a set of collocation points that are effective even with a small number of points and for multi-dimensional spaces. Our experiments demonstrate that GLT requires 2--20 times fewer collocation points (resulting in lower computational cost) than uniformly random sampling or Latin hypercube sampling, while achieving competitive performance.

In this work, we develop the first analytical estimators to efficiently compute local robustness of multi-class discriminative models using local linear function approximation and the multivariate Normal CDF. Through the derivation of these estimators, we show how local robustness is connected to concepts such as randomized smoothing and softmax probability. We also confirm empirically that these estimators accurately and efficiently compute the local robustness of standard deep learning models. In addition, we demonstrate these estimators' usefulness for various tasks involving local robustness, such as measuring robustness bias and identifying examples that are vulnerable to noise perturbation in a dataset. By developing these analytical estimators, this work not only advances conceptual understanding of local robustness, but also makes its computation practical, enabling the use of local robustness in critical downstream applications.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates methods for improving generative data augmentation for deep learning. Generative data augmentation leverages the synthetic samples produced by generative models as an additional dataset for classification with small dataset settings. A key challenge of generative data augmentation is that the synthetic data contain uninformative samples that degrade accuracy. This is because the synthetic samples do not perfectly represent class categories in real data and uniform sampling does not necessarily provide useful samples for tasks. In this paper, we present a novel strategy for generative data augmentation called meta generative regularization (MGR). To avoid the degradation of generative data augmentation, MGR utilizes synthetic samples in the regularization term for feature extractors instead of in the loss function, e.g., cross-entropy. These synthetic samples are dynamically determined to minimize the validation losses through meta-learning. We observed that MGR can avoid the performance degradation of na\\\"ive generative data augmentation and boost the baselines. Experiments on six datasets showed that MGR is effective particularly when datasets are smaller and stably outperforms baselines. ",

NN-based analytics of time-series data offer valuable insights into past behaviors and estimates of critical parameters like remaining useful life (RUL) of equipment and state-of-charge (SOC) of batteries. However, input time series data can be exposed to intentional or unintentional noise when passing through sensors, necessitating robust validation and verification of these NNs. This paper presents a case study of the robustness verification approach for time series regression NNs (TSRegNN) using set-based formal methods. It focuses on utilizing variable-length input data to streamline input manipulation and enhance network architecture generalizability. The method is applied to two data sets in the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) application areas: (1) SOC estimation of a Lithium-ion battery and (2) RUL estimation of a turbine engine. The NNs' robustness is checked using star-based reachability analysis, and several performance measures evaluate the effect of bounded perturbations in the input on network outputs, i.e., future outcomes. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive case study for validating and verifying NN-based analytics of time-series data in real-world applications, emphasizing the importance of robustness testing for accurate and reliable predictions, especially considering the impact of noise on future outcomes.

Particle crushing, as a significant field of civil engineering, describes the breakage of granular materials caused by the breakage of particle fragment bonds under the modeling of numerical simulations, which motivates us to characterize the mechanical behaviors of particle crushing through the connectivity of particle fragments with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, there lacks an open-source large-scale particle crushing dataset for research due to the expensive costs of laboratory tests or numerical simulations. Therefore, we firstly generate a dataset with 45,000 numerical simulations and 900 particle types to facilitate the research progress of machine learning for particle crushing. Secondly, we devise a hybrid framework based on GNNs to predict particle crushing strength in a particle fragment view with the advances of state of the art GNNs. Finally, we compare our hybrid framework against traditional machine learning methods and the plain MLP to verify its effectiveness. The usefulness of different features is further discussed through the gradient attribution explanation w.r.t the predictions.

By contrast, in recent years, dual-target CDR has been proposed to improve the recommendation performance on both domains simultaneously. However, to this end, there are two challenges in dual-target CDR: (1) how to generate both relevant and diverse augmented user representations, and (2) how to effectively decouple domain-independent information from domain-specific information, in addition to domain-shared information, to capture comprehensive user preferences. To address the above two challenges, we propose a Disentanglement-based framework with Interpolative Data Augmentation for dual-target Cross-Domain Recommendation, called DIDA-CDR. In DIDA-CDR, we first propose an interpolative data augmentation approach to generating both relevant and diverse augmented user representations to augment sparser domain and explore potential user preferences. We then propose a disentanglement module to effectively decouple domain-specific and domain-independent information to capture comprehensive user preferences. Both steps significantly contribute to capturing more comprehensive user preferences, thereby improving the recommendation performance on each domain.

We introduce a method for translating established, vetted social scientific constructs into AI objective functions, which we term societal objective functions, and demonstrate the method with application to the political science construct of anti-democratic attitudes. Traditionally, we have lacked observable outcomes to use to train such models, however, the social sciences have developed survey instruments and qualitative codebooks for these constructs, and their precision facilitates translation into detailed prompts for large language models. We apply this method to create a democratic attitude model that estimates the extent to which a social media post promotes anti-democratic attitudes, and test this democratic attitude model across three studies. In Study 1, we first test the attitudinal and behavioral effectiveness of the intervention among US partisans (N=1,380) by manually annotating (alpha=.895) social media posts with anti-democratic attitude scores and testing several feed ranking conditions based on these scores. Removal (d=.20) and downranking feeds (d=.25) reduced participants' partisan animosity without compromising their experience and engagement. In Study 2, we scale up the manual labels by creating the democratic attitude model, finding strong agreement with manual labels (rho=.75). Finally, in Study 3, we replicate Study 1 using the democratic attitude model instead of manual labels to test its attitudinal and behavioral impact (N=558), and again find that the feed downranking using the societal objective function reduced partisan animosity (d=.25). This method presents a novel strategy to draw on social science theory and methods to mitigate societal harms in social media AIs. ",

However, computational challenges arise due to joint inference over combinatorial space of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and nonlinear functions. Despite recent progress towards efficient posterior inference over DAGs, existing methods are either limited to variational inference on node permutation matrices for linear causal models, leading to compromised inference accuracy, or continuous relaxation of adjacency matrices constrained by a DAG regularizer, which cannot ensure resulting graphs are DAGs. In this work, we introduce a scalable Bayesian causal discovery framework based on stochastic gradient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) that overcomes these limitations. Our approach directly samples DAGs from the posterior without requiring any DAG regularization, simultaneously draws function parameter samples and is applicable to both linear and nonlinear causal models. To enable our approach, we derive a novel equivalence to the permutation-based DAG learning, which opens up possibilities of using any relaxed gradient estimator defined over permutations. To our knowledge, this is the first framework applying gradient-based MCMC sampling for causal discovery. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate our approach's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art baselines. ",

In a bipartite graph it is trivial to find an independent set of density at least half (take one of the partition classes). In contrast, in a random bipartite graph of average degree $d$, the largest balanced independent sets (containing equal number of vertices from each class) are typically of density $(2+o_d(1)) \\frac{\\log d}{d}$. Can we find such large balanced independent sets in these graphs efficiently? By utilizing the overlap gap property and the low-degree algorithmic framework, we prove that local and low-degree algorithms (even those that know the bipartition) cannot find balanced independent sets of density greater than $(1+\\epsilon) \\frac{\\log d}{d}$ for any $\\epsilon>0$ fixed and $d$ large but constant. This factor $2$ statistical--computational gap between what exists and what local algorithms can achieve is analogous to the gap for finding large independent sets in (non-bipartite) random graphs. Our results therefor suggest that this gap is pervasive in many models, and that hard computational problems can lurk inside otherwise tractable ones. A particularly striking aspect of the gap in bipartite graphs is that the algorithm achieving the lower bound is extremely simple and can be implemented as a $1$-local algorithm and a degree-$1$ polynomial (a linear function).

We find that this condition depends on the nature of pairwise interactions and on the network structure, but is explicitly independent of the total number of agents in the game. We evaluate this result on a number of representative network games and show that, under suitable network conditions, stable learning dynamics can be achieved with an arbitrary number of agents. ",

To overcome these issues, we propose an easy and deployment-friendly network (called EasyNet) without using pre-trained models and memory banks: firstly, we design a multi-scale multi-modality feature encoder-decoder to accurately reconstruct the segmentation maps of anomalous regions and encourage the interaction between RGB images and depth images; secondly, we adopt a multi-modality anomaly segmentation network to achieve a precise anomaly map; thirdly, we propose an attention-based information entropy fusion module for feature fusion during inference, making it suitable for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments show that EasyNet achieves an anomaly detection AUROC of 92.6% without using pre-trained models and memory banks. In addition, EasyNet is faster than existing methods, with a high frame rate of 94.55 FPS on a Tesla V100 GPU. ",

However, some of the existing methods lack a comparative image to measure densities, and others create intermediate results but lack the exploitation of their density differences, which can facilitate perception of density. To address these deficiencies, we propose a density-aware dehazing method named Density Feature Refinement Network (DFR-Net) that extracts haze density features from density differences and leverages density differences to refine density features. In DFR-Net, we first generate a proposal image that has lower overall density than the hazy input, bringing in global density differences. Additionally, the dehazing residual of the proposal image reflects the level of dehazing performance and provides local density differences that indicate localized hard dehazing or high density areas. Subsequently, we introduce a Global Branch (GB) and a Local Branch (LB) to achieve density-awareness. In GB, we use Siamese networks for feature extraction of hazy inputs and proposal images, and we propose a Global Density Feature Refinement (GDFR) module that can refine features by pushing features with different global densities further away. In LB, we explore local density features from the dehazing residuals between hazy inputs and proposal images and introduce an Intermediate Dehazing Residual Feedforward (IDRF) module to update local features and pull them closer to clear image features.

Additionally, we introduce a novel class-aware pseudo-label selection strategy for weak-to-strong supervision, which addresses the limitations of most existing methods that do not perform selection or apply a predefined threshold for all classes. Specifically, our strategy selects the top high-confidence prediction of the weak view for each class to generate pseudo labels that supervise the strong augmented views. This strategy is capable of taking into account the class imbalance and improving the performance of long-tailed classes. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on two datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes, outperforming other SSS algorithms by a significant margin. ",

We theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and empirically show that it significantly outperforms the state of the arts in a wide range of tasks including classification, regression, and semantic segmentation.

In particular, we randomly sample nodes and edges from a given graph to build the input subset for a view. Two views are fed into a parameter-shared Siamese network to extract the high-dimensional embeddings and estimate the information entropy of the entire graph. For the learning process, we propose to optimize the network using two objectives, simultaneously. Concretely, the input of the contrastive loss function consists of positive and negative pairs. Our selection strategy of pairs is different from previous works and we present a novel strategy to enhance the representation ability of the graph encoder by selecting nodes based on cross-view similarities. We enrich the diversity of the positive and negative pairs by selecting highly similar samples and totally different data with the guidance of cross-view similarity scores, respectively. We also introduce a cross-view consistency constraint on the representations generated from the different views. This objective guarantees the learned representations are consistent across views from the perspective of the entire graph.

Traditional studies on voice-face correlations typically involve using a long period of voice input, including generating face images from voices and reconstructing 3D face meshes from voices. However, in situations like voice-based crimes, the available voice evidence may be short and limited. Additionally, from a physiological perspective, each segment of speech -- phoneme -- corresponds to different types of airflow and movements in the face. Therefore, it is advantageous to discover the hidden link between phonemes and face attributes. In this paper, we propose an analysis pipeline to help us explore the voice-face relationship in a fine-grained manner, i.e., phonemes v.s. facial anthropometric measurements (AM). We build an estimator for each phoneme-AM pair and evaluate the correlation through hypothesis testing. Our results indicate that AMs are more predictable from vowels compared to consonants, particularly with plosives. Additionally, we observe that if a specific AM exhibits more movement during phoneme pronunciation, it is more predictable. Our findings support those in physiology regarding correlation and lay the groundwork for future research on speech-face multimodal learning. ",

In particular, we first propose Minkowski difference based linear separability measures (MD-LSMs) to evaluate the linear separability degree of two points sets. Then, we demonstrate that there is a synchronicity between the linear separability degree of hidden layer outputs and the network training performance, i.e., if the updated weights can enhance the linear separability degree of hidden layer outputs, the updated network will achieve a better training performance, and vice versa. Moreover, we study the effect of activation function and network size (including width and depth) on the linear separability of hidden layers. Finally, we conduct the numerical experiments to validate our findings on some popular deep networks including multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), deep belief network (DBN), ResNet, VGGNet, AlexNet, vision transformer (ViT) and GoogLeNet.

In addition, AEs have adversarial transferability, which means AEs generated for a source model can fool another black-box model (target model) with a non-trivial probability. In previous studies, it was confirmed that the vision transformer (ViT) is more robust against the property of adversarial transferability than convolutional neural network (CNN) models such as ConvMixer, and moreover encrypted ViT is more robust than ViT without any encryption. In this article, we propose a random ensemble of encrypted ViT models to achieve much more robust models.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. Based on the statistical correlations uncovered by deep learning-based methods, computer vision technology has contributed to tremendous growth in areas such as autonomous driving and robotics. Despite being the basis of deep learning, such correlation is not stable and is susceptible to uncontrolled factors. In the absence of the guidance of prior knowledge, statistical correlations can easily turn into spurious correlations and cause confounders. As a result, researchers are beginning to refine deep learning-based methods with causal theory. Causal theory models the intrinsic causal structure unaffected by data bias and is effective in avoiding spurious correlations. This paper aims to comprehensively review the existing causal methods in typical vision and vision-language tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and image captioning. The advantages of causality and the approaches for building causal paradigms will be summarized. Future roadmaps are also proposed, including facilitating the development of causal theory and its application in other complex scenes and systems. ",

We observe that human motions have transitional patterns and can be split into snippets representative of each transition. Each snippet can be reconstructed from its starting and ending poses referred to as the transitional poses. We propose a snippet-to-motion multi-stage framework that breaks motion prediction into sub-tasks easier to accomplish. Each sub-task integrates three modules: transitional pose prediction, snippet reconstruction, and snippet-to-motion prediction. Specifically, we propose to first predict only the transitional poses. Then we use them to reconstruct the corresponding snippets, obtaining a close approximation to the true motion sequence. Finally we refine them to produce the final prediction output. To implement the network, we propose a novel unified graph modeling, which allows for direct and effective feature propagation compared to existing approaches which rely on separate space-time modeling. Extensive experiments on Human 3.6M, CMU Mocap and 3DPW datasets verify the effectiveness of our method which achieves state-of-the-art performance. ",

This motivates many works to improve the generalization, but forgery-irrelevant information, such as image background and identity, still exists in different domain features and causes unexpected clustering, limiting the generalization. In this paper, we propose a controllable guide-space (GS) method to enhance the discrimination of different forgery domains, so as to increase the forgery relevance of features and thereby improve the generalization. The well-designed guide-space can simultaneously achieve both the proper separation of forgery domains and the large distance between real-forgery domains in an explicit and controllable manner. Moreover, for better discrimination, we use a decoupling module to weaken the interference of forgery-irrelevant correlations between domains. Furthermore, we make adjustments to the decision boundary manifold according to the clustering degree of the same domain features within the neighborhood. Extensive experiments in multiple in-domain and cross-domain settings confirm that our method can achieve state-of-the-art generalization. ",

    "abstract": "Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models have shown vulnerability to adversarial examples in multimodal tasks. Furthermore, malicious adversaries can be deliberately transferred to attack other black-box models. However, existing work has mainly focused on investigating white-box attacks. In this paper, we present the first study to investigate the adversarial transferability of recent VLP models. We observe that existing methods exhibit much lower transferability, compared to the strong attack performance in white-box settings. The transferability degradation is partly caused by the under-utilization of cross-modal interactions. Particularly, unlike unimodal learning, VLP models rely heavily on cross-modal interactions and the multimodal alignments are many-to-many, e.g., an image can be described in various natural languages. To this end, we propose a highly transferable Set-level Guidance Attack (SGA) that thoroughly leverages modality interactions and incorporates alignment-preserving augmentation with cross-modal guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that SGA could generate adversarial examples that can strongly transfer across different VLP models on multiple downstream vision-language tasks. On image-text retrieval, SGA significantly enhances the attack success rate for transfer attacks from ALBEF to TCL by a large margin (at least 9.78% and up to 30.21%), compared to the state-of-the-art.

However, it is hard to manually label edges accurately, especially for large datasets, and thus the datasets inevitably contain noisy labels. This label-noise issue has been studied extensively for classification, while still remaining under-explored for edge detection. To address the label-noise issue for edge detection, this paper proposes to learn Pixel-level NoiseTransitions to model the label-corruption process. To achieve it, we develop a novel Pixel-wise Shift Learning (PSL) module to estimate the transition from clean to noisy labels as a displacement field. Exploiting the estimated noise transitions, our model, named PNT-Edge, is able to fit the prediction to clean labels. In addition, a local edge density regularization term is devised to exploit local structure information for better transition learning. This term encourages learning large shifts for the edges with complex local structures. Experiments on SBD and Cityscapes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in relieving the impact of label noise. Codes will be available at github. ",

Unfortunately, current methods with a fixed model do not work uniformly well across various datasets, greatly limiting their real-world applicability. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a new perspective to dynamically calculate correlation for robust stereo matching. A novel Uncertainty Guided Adaptive Correlation (UGAC) module is introduced to robustly adapt the same model for different scenarios. Specifically, a variance-based uncertainty estimation is employed to adaptively adjust the sampling area during warping operation. Additionally, we improve the traditional non-parametric warping with learnable parameters, such that the position-specific weights can be learned. We show that by empowering the recurrent network with the UGAC module, stereo matching can be exploited more robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance over the ETH3D, KITTI, and Middlebury datasets when employing the same fixed model over these datasets without any retraining procedure. To target real-time applications, we further design a lightweight model based on UGAC, which also outperforms other methods over KITTI benchmarks with only 0.6 M parameters. ",

In this paper, we present Gleam, an RDMA-accelerated multicast protocol that simultaneously supports optimal multicast forwarding, efficient utilization of the prominent RDMA capabilities, and compatibility with the commodity RNICs. At its core, Gleam re-purposes the existing RDMA RC logic with careful switch coordination as an efficient multicast transport. Gleam performs the one-to-many connection maintenance and many-to-one feedback aggregation, based on an extended multicast forwarding table structure, to achieve integration between standard RC logic and in-fabric multicast. We implement a fully functional Gleam prototype. With extensive testbed experiments and simulations, we demonstrate Gleam's significant improvement in accelerating multicast communication of realistic applications. For instance, Gleam achieves 2.9X lower communication time of an HPC benchmark application and 2.7X higher data replication throughput. ",

In particular, our method allows to identify the Design Parameter (DPs) affected due to a cyber attack launched on a different set of DPs in the same CPS. To achieve this, we adopt causal graphs to causally link DPs with each other and quantify the impact of one DP on another. Using SWaT, a real world testbed of a water treatment system, we demonstrate that causal graphs can be build in two ways: i) using domain knowledge of the control logic and the physical connectivity structure of the DPs, we call these causal domain graphs and ii) learning from operational data logs, we call these causal learnt graphs. We then compare these graphs when a same set of DPs is used. Our analysis shows a common set of edges between the causal domain graphs and the causal learnt graphs exists, which helps validate the causal learnt graphs. Additionally, we show that the learnt graphs can discover new causal relations, not initially considered in the domain graphs, that help significantly characterising the impact of the attack. We use causal domain graphs to estimate the parameters of the graphs, and the causal learnt graphs for causal inference. To learn the structure of the causal learnt graphs in all the six-stages of SWaT, we experiment with three learning algorithms: Peter Clarke (PC), Hill Climb (HC) search and Chow-Lie (CH). Finally, we demonstrate how causal graphs can be used to analyse the impact of cyber attacks by analysing nine well known cyber attacks on the SWaT test bed. We find that by using causal learnt graphs the DPs impacted by the attacks are correctly discovered with a probability greater than 0.9. ",

ASPP uses multiple atrous convolutions with different atrous rates to extract both local and global information. However, fixed values of atrous rates are used for the ASPP module, which restricts the size of its field of view. In principle, atrous rate should be a hyperparameter to change the field of view size according to the target task or dataset. However, the manipulation of atrous rate is not governed by any guidelines. This study proposes practical guidelines for obtaining an optimal atrous rate. First, an effective receptive field for semantic segmentation is introduced to analyze the inner behavior of segmentation networks. We observed that the use of ASPP module yielded a specific pattern in the effective receptive field, which was traced to reveal the module's underlying mechanism. Accordingly, we derive practical guidelines for obtaining the optimal atrous rate, which should be controlled based on the size of input image. Compared to other values, using the optimal atrous rate consistently improved the segmentation results across multiple datasets, including the STARE, CHASE_DB1, HRF, Cityscapes, and iSAID datasets.

A popular approach to building discrete-continuous computation graphs is that of integrating discrete probability distributions into neural networks using stochastic softmax tricks. Prior work has mainly focused on computation graphs with a single discrete component on each of the graph's execution paths. We analyze the behavior of more complex stochastic computations graphs with multiple sequential discrete components. We show that it is challenging to optimize the parameters of these models, mainly due to small gradients and local minima. We then propose two new strategies to overcome these challenges. First, we show that increasing the scale parameter of the Gumbel noise perturbations during training improves the learning behavior. Second, we propose dropout residual connections specifically tailored to stochastic, discrete-continuous computation graphs. With an extensive set of experiments, we show that we can train complex discrete-continuous models which one cannot train with standard stochastic softmax tricks. We also show that complex discrete-stochastic models generalize better than their continuous counterparts on several benchmark datasets. ",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a spherical transmitter (TX) with a membrane covered by heterogeneous receptors of varying sizes and arbitrary locations for molecular communication (MC), where molecules are encapsulated within vesicles and released from the TX through membrane fusion. Assuming continuous vesicle generation at the TX and a transparent receiver (RX), we calculate the molecule release rate, the fraction of absorbed molecules at the TX, and the received signal at the RX. All obtained analytical expressions are functions of all receptors locations and sizes, and are validated by particle-based simulations. Our numerical results indicate that evenly distributed receptors on the TX membrane can absorb more molecules than randomly distributed receptors or a single receptor. Furthermore, inspired by the autoreceptor functionality in synaptic communication, we incorporate a negative feedback mechanism (NFM) at the TX, such that molecule release stops after a certain period. We then derive the fraction of molecules that can be reused for the subsequent emissions when considering both NFM and molecule harvesting. Our numerical results demonstrate that incorporating NFM can reduce inter-symbol interference (ISI) while maintaining the same peak received signal as the case without NFM. Additionally, our results show that TXs incorporating both molecule harvesting and NFM can achieve a higher energy efficiency and lower error probability than TXs employing only molecule harvesting or neither functionality.

    "abstract": "Data-driven requirements engineering leverages the abundance of openly accessible and crowdsourced information on the web. By incorporating user feedback provided about a software product, such as reviews in mobile app stores, these approaches facilitate the identification of issues, bug fixes, and implementation of change requests. However, relying solely on user feedback about a software product limits the possibility of eliciting all requirements, as users may not always have a clear understanding of their exact needs from the software, despite their wealth of experience with the problem, event, or challenges they encounter and use the software to assist them. In this study, we propose a shift in requirements elicitation, focusing on gathering feedback related to the problem itself rather than relying solely on feedback about the software product. We conducted a case study on student requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic in a higher education institution. We gathered their communications from Reddit during the pandemic and employed multiple machine-learning and natural language processing techniques to identify requirement sentences. We achieved the F-score of 0.79 using Naive Bayes with TF-IDF when benchmarking multiple techniques. The results lead us to believe that mining requirements from communication about a problem are feasible. While we present the preliminary results, we envision a future where these requirements complement conventionally elicited requirements and help to close the requirements gap. ",

VSE networks can be used in cross-modal search engines to embed image and textual descriptions in a shared space, enabling image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks. However, the full potential of VSE networks for search engines has yet to be fully explored. This paper presents Boon, a novel cross-modal search engine that combines two state-of-the-art networks: the GPT-3.5-turbo large language model, and the VSE network VITR (VIsion Transformers with Relation-focused learning) to enhance the engine's capabilities in extracting and reasoning with regional relationships in images. VITR employs encoders from CLIP that were trained with 400 million image-description pairs and it was fine-turned on the RefCOCOg dataset. Boon's neural-based components serve as its main functionalities: 1) a 'cross-modal search engine' that enables end-users to perform image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval. 2) a 'multi-lingual conversational AI' component that enables the end-user to converse about one or more images selected by the end-user. Such a feature makes the search engine accessible to a wide audience, including those with visual impairments. 3) Boon is multi-lingual and can take queries and handle conversations about images in multiple languages. Boon was implemented using the Django and PyTorch frameworks. The interface and capabilities of the Boon search engine are demonstrated using the RefCOCOg dataset, and the engine's ability to search for multimedia through the web is facilitated by Google's API.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are successfully used in various applications, but show their vulnerability to adversarial examples. With the development of adversarial patches, the feasibility of attacks in physical scenes increases, and the defenses against patch attacks are urgently needed. However, defending such adversarial patch attacks is still an unsolved problem. In this paper, we analyse the properties of adversarial patches, and find that: on the one hand, adversarial patches will lead to the appearance or contextual inconsistency in the target objects; on the other hand, the patch region will show abnormal changes on the high-level feature maps of the objects extracted by a backbone network. Considering the above two points, we propose a novel defense method based on a ``localizing and inpainting\" mechanism to pre-process the input examples. Specifically, we design an unified framework, where the ``localizing\" sub-network utilizes a two-branch structure to represent the above two aspects to accurately detect the adversarial patch region in the image. For the ``inpainting\" sub-network, it utilizes the surrounding contextual cues to recover the original content covered by the adversarial patch. The quality of inpainted images is also evaluated by measuring the appearance consistency and the effects of adversarial attacks. These two sub-networks are then jointly trained via an iterative optimization manner. In this way, the ``localizing\" and ``inpainting\" modules can interact closely with each other, and thus learn a better solution. A series of experiments versus traffic sign classification and detection tasks are conducted to defend against various adversarial patch attacks. ",

In this scenario, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) play a crucial role and data-driven IDSs based on machine learning (ML) have recently attracted more and more interest by the research community. While conventional ML-based IDSs are based on a centralized architecture where IoT devices share their data with a central server for model training, we propose a novel approach that is based on federated learning (FL). However, conventional FL is ineffective in the considered scenario, due to the high statistical heterogeneity of data collected by IoT devices. To overcome this limitation, we propose a three-tier FL-based architecture where IoT devices are clustered together based on their statistical properties. Clustering decisions are taken by means of a novel entropy-based strategy, which helps improve model training performance. We tested our solution on the CIC-ToN-IoT dataset: our clustering strategy increases intrusion detection performance with respect to a conventional FL approach up to +17% in terms of F1-score, along with a significant reduction of the number of training rounds.

    "abstract": "With the advent of standards for deterministic network behavior, synthesizing network designs under delay constraints becomes the natural next task to tackle. Network Calculus (NC) has become a key method for validating industrial networks, as it computes formally verified end-to-end delay bounds. However, analyses from the NC framework have been designed to bound the delay of one flow at a time. Attempts to use classical analyses to derive a network configuration have shown that this approach is poorly suited to practical use cases. Consider finding a delay-optimal routing configuration: one model had to be created for each routing alternative, then each flow delay had to be bounded, and then the bounds had to be compared to the given constraints. To overcome this three-step process, we introduce Differential Network Calculus. We extend NC to allow the differentiation of delay bounds w.r.t. to a wide range of network parameters - such as flow paths or priority. This opens up NC to a class of efficient nonlinear optimization techniques that exploit the gradient of the delay bound. Our numerical evaluation on the routing and priority assignment problem shows that our novel method can synthesize flow paths and priorities in a matter of seconds, outperforming existing methods by several orders of magnitude.

In a PLS, a certificate is assigned to each processing node of the network, and the nodes are in charge of checking that the collection of certificates forms a global proof that the system is in a correct state, by exchanging the certificates once, between neighbors only. The main measure of complexity is the size of the certificates. Many PLSs have been designed for certifying specific predicates, including cycle-freeness, minimum-weight spanning tree, planarity, etc. In 2021, a breakthrough has been obtained, as a meta-theorem stating that a large set of properties have compact PLSs in a large class of networks. Namely, for every $\\mathrm{MSO}_2$ property $\\Pi$ on labeled graphs, there exists a PLS for $\\Pi$ with $O(\\log n)$-bit certificates for all graphs of bounded tree-depth. This result has been extended to the larger class of graphs with bounded {tree-width}, using certificates on $O(\\log^2 n)$ bits. We extend this result even further, to the larger class of graphs with bounded clique-width, which, as opposed to the other two aforementioned classes, includes dense graphs.

There is enormous interest in the fields of cognitive robotics and human-robot interaction on understanding and predicting human actions as early as possible. Early prediction allows anticipating complex stages for planning, enabling effective and real-time interaction. Our Transformer network uses events to predict manipulation actions as they occur, using online inference. The model succeeds at predicting actions early on, building up confidence over time and achieving state-of-the-art classification. Moreover, the attention-based transformer architecture allows us to study the role of the spatio-temporal patterns selected by the model. Our experiments show that the Transformer network captures action dynamic features outperforming video-based approaches and succeeding with scenarios where the differences between actions lie in very subtle cues.

    "abstract": "Financial contagion has been widely recognized as a fundamental risk to the financial system. Particularly potent is price-mediated contagion, wherein forced liquidations by firms depress asset prices and propagate financial stress, enabling crises to proliferate across a broad spectrum of seemingly unrelated entities. Price impacts are currently modeled via exogenous inverse demand functions. However, in real-world scenarios, only the initial shocks and the final equilibrium asset prices are typically observable, leaving actual asset liquidations largely obscured. This missing data presents significant limitations to calibrating the existing models. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel dual neural network structure that operates in two sequential stages: the first neural network maps initial shocks to predicted asset liquidations, and the second network utilizes these liquidations to derive resultant equilibrium prices. This data-driven approach can capture both linear and non-linear forms without pre-specifying an analytical structure; furthermore, it functions effectively even in the absence of observable liquidation data. Experiments with simulated datasets demonstrate that our model can accurately predict equilibrium asset prices based solely on initial shocks, while revealing a strong alignment between predicted and true liquidations. Our explainable framework contributes to the understanding and modeling of price-mediated contagion and provides valuable insights for financial authorities to construct effective stress tests and regulatory policies.
