    "abstract": "Over the last few years, neural image compression has gained wide attention from research and industry, yielding promising end-to-end deep neural codecs outperforming their conventional counterparts in rate-distortion performance. Despite significant advancement, current methods, including attention-based transform coding, still need to be improved in reducing the coding rate while preserving the reconstruction fidelity, especially in non-homogeneous textured image areas. Those models also require more parameters and a higher decoding time. To tackle the above challenges, we propose ConvNeXt-ChARM, an efficient ConvNeXt-based transform coding framework, paired with a compute-efficient channel-wise auto-regressive prior to capturing both global and local contexts from the hyper and quantized latent representations. The proposed architecture can be optimized end-to-end to fully exploit the context information and extract compact latent representation while reconstructing higher-quality images. Experimental results on four widely-used datasets showed that ConvNeXt-ChARM brings consistent and significant BD-rate (PSNR) reductions estimated on average to 5.24% and 1.22% over the versatile video coding (VVC) reference encoder (VTM-18.0) and the state-of-the-art learned image compression method SwinT-ChARM, respectively. Moreover, we provide model scaling studies to verify the computational efficiency of our approach and conduct several objective and subjective analyses to bring to the fore the performance gap between the next generation ConvNet, namely ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer.

    "abstract": "Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, typically acquired from wearable devices, hold significant potential for continuous fitness-health monitoring. In particular, heart conditions that manifest in rare and subtle deviating heart patterns may be interesting. However, robust and reliable anomaly detection within these data remains a challenge due to the scarcity of labeled data and high inter-subject variability. This paper introduces a two-stage framework leveraging representation learning and personalization to improve anomaly detection performance in PPG data. The proposed framework first employs representation learning to transform the original PPG signals into a more discriminative and compact representation. We then apply three different unsupervised anomaly detection methods for movement detection and biometric identification. We validate our approach using two different datasets in both generalized and personalized scenarios. The results show that representation learning significantly improves anomaly detection performance while reducing the high inter-subject variability. Personalized models further enhance anomaly detection performance, underscoring the role of personalization in PPG-based fitness-health monitoring systems. The results from biometric identification show that it's easier to distinguish a new user from one intended authorized user than from a group of users. Overall, this study provides evidence of the effectiveness of representation learning and personalization for anomaly detection in PPG data. ",

    "abstract": "Understanding how the dynamics in biological and artificial neural networks implement the computations required for a task is a salient open question in machine learning and neuroscience. In particular, computations requiring complex memory storage and retrieval pose a significant challenge for these networks to implement or learn. Recently, a family of models described by neural ordinary differential equations (nODEs) has emerged as powerful dynamical neural network models capable of capturing complex dynamics. Here, we extend nODEs by endowing them with adaptive timescales using gating interactions. We refer to these as gated neural ODEs (gnODEs). Using a task that requires memory of continuous quantities, we demonstrate the inductive bias of the gnODEs to learn (approximate) continuous attractors. We further show how reduced-dimensional gnODEs retain their modeling power while greatly improving interpretability, even allowing explicit visualization of the structure of learned attractors. We introduce a novel measure of expressivity which probes the capacity of a neural network to generate complex trajectories. Using this measure, we explore how the phase-space dimension of the nODEs and the complexity of the function modeling the flow field contribute to expressivity. We see that a more complex function for modeling the flow field allows a lower-dimensional nODE to capture a given target dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate the benefit of gating in nODEs on several real-world tasks. ",

The decoder consists of several bidirectional feature pyramid layers with reverse attention modules to better fuse feature maps at various levels and incrementally refine polyp boundaries. We also propose ideas to lighten the reverse attention module and make it more suitable for multi-class segmentation. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing methods across all datasets while maintaining low computational complexity.

    "abstract": "Graph learning methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) based on graph convolutions, are highly successful in solving real-world learning problems involving graph-structured data. However, graph learning methods expose sensitive user information and interactions not only through their model parameters but also through their model predictions. Consequently, standard Differential Privacy (DP) techniques that merely offer model weight privacy are inadequate. This is especially the case for node predictions that leverage neighboring node attributes directly via graph convolutions that create additional risks of privacy leakage. To address this problem, we introduce Graph Differential Privacy (GDP), a new formal DP framework tailored to graph learning settings that ensures both provably private model parameters and predictions. Furthermore, since there may be different privacy requirements for the node attributes and graph structure, we introduce a novel notion of relaxed node-level data adjacency. This relaxation can be used for establishing guarantees for different degrees of graph topology privacy while maintaining node attribute privacy. Importantly, this relaxation reveals a useful trade-off between utility and topology privacy for graph learning methods. In addition, our analysis of GDP reveals that existing DP-GNNs fail to exploit this trade-off due to the complex interplay between graph topology and attribute data in standard graph convolution designs. To mitigate this problem, we introduce the Differentially Private Decoupled Graph Convolution (DPDGC) model, which benefits from decoupled graph convolution while providing GDP guarantees. Extensive experiments on seven node classification benchmarking datasets demonstrate the superior privacy-utility trade-off of DPDGC over existing DP-GNNs based on standard graph convolution design.

This network reduces the memory burden by close to 50% and runs up to four times faster during inference time compared to existing transformer-based interpolation methods. A dual-encoder architecture is introduced which combines the strength of convolutions in modelling local correlations with those of the transformer for long-range dependencies.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel Single-class target-specific Adversarial attack called SingleADV. The goal of SingleADV is to generate a universal perturbation that deceives the target model into confusing a specific category of objects with a target category while ensuring highly relevant and accurate interpretations. The universal perturbation is stochastically and iteratively optimized by minimizing the adversarial loss that is designed to consider both the classifier and interpreter costs in targeted and non-targeted categories. In this optimization framework, ruled by the first- and second-moment estimations, the desired loss surface promotes high confidence and interpretation score of adversarial samples. By avoiding unintended misclassification of samples from other categories, SingleADV enables more effective targeted attacks on interpretable deep learning systems in both white-box and black-box scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of SingleADV, we conduct experiments using four different model architectures (ResNet-50, VGG-16, DenseNet-169, and Inception-V3) coupled with three interpretation models (CAM, Grad, and MASK). Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that SingleADV effectively deceives the target deep learning models and their associated interpreters under various conditions and settings. Our experimental results show that the performance of SingleADV is effective, with an average fooling ratio of 0.74 and an adversarial confidence level of 0.78 in generating deceptive adversarial samples. Furthermore, we discuss several countermeasures against SingleADV, including a transfer-based learning approach and existing preprocessing defenses. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models are susceptible to adversarial samples in white and black-box environments. Although previous studies have shown high attack success rates, coupling DNN models with interpretation models could offer a sense of security when a human expert is involved, who can identify whether a given sample is benign or malicious. However, in white-box environments, interpretable deep learning systems (IDLSes) have been shown to be vulnerable to malicious manipulations. In black-box settings, as access to the components of IDLSes is limited, it becomes more challenging for the adversary to fool the system. In this work, we propose a Query-efficient Score-based black-box attack against IDLSes, QuScore, which requires no knowledge of the target model and its coupled interpretation model. QuScore is based on transfer-based and score-based methods by employing an effective microbial genetic algorithm. Our method is designed to reduce the number of queries necessary to carry out successful attacks, resulting in a more efficient process. By continuously refining the adversarial samples created based on feedback scores from the IDLS, our approach effectively navigates the search space to identify perturbations that can fool the system. We evaluate the attack's effectiveness on four CNN models (Inception, ResNet, VGG, DenseNet) and two interpretation models (CAM, Grad), using both ImageNet and CIFAR datasets. Our results show that the proposed approach is query-efficient with a high attack success rate that can reach between 95% and 100% and transferability with an average success rate of 69% in the ImageNet and CIFAR datasets. Our attack method generates adversarial examples with attribution maps that resemble benign samples. We have also demonstrated that our attack is resilient against various preprocessing defense techniques and can easily be transferred to different DNN models. ",

    "abstract": "Egocentric action recognition is gaining significant attention in the field of human action recognition. In this paper, we address data scarcity issue in egocentric action recognition from a compositional generalization perspective. To tackle this problem, we propose a free-form composition network (FFCN) that can simultaneously learn disentangled verb, preposition, and noun representations, and then use them to compose new samples in the feature space for rare classes of action videos. First, we use a graph to capture the spatial-temporal relations among different hand/object instances in each action video. We thus decompose each action into a set of verb and preposition spatial-temporal representations using the edge features in the graph. The temporal decomposition extracts verb and preposition representations from different video frames, while the spatial decomposition adaptively learns verb and preposition representations from action-related instances in each frame. With these spatial-temporal representations of verbs and prepositions, we can compose new samples for those rare classes in a free-form manner, which is not restricted to a rigid form of a verb and a noun. The proposed FFCN can directly generate new training data samples for rare classes, hence significantly improve action recognition performance. We evaluated our method on three popular egocentric action recognition datasets, Something-Something V2, H2O, and EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for handling data scarcity problems, including long-tailed and few-shot egocentric action recognition.

In this work, we propose DSV (Discordance and Separability Validation), an unsupervised validation loss to select high-performing detection models with effective augmentation HPs. DSV captures the alignment between an augmentation function and the anomaly-generating mechanism with surrogate losses, which approximate the discordance and separability of test data, respectively. As a result, the evaluation via DSV leads to selecting an effective SSAD model exhibiting better alignment, which results in high detection accuracy. We theoretically derive the degree of approximation conducted by the surrogate losses and empirically show that DSV outperforms a wide range of baselines on 21 real-world tasks. ",

However, existing works about AutoML for adversarial attacks only focus on $L_{\\infty}$-norm-based perturbations. In fact, semantic perturbations attract increasing attention due to their naturalnesses and physical realizability. To bridge the gap between AutoML and semantic adversarial attacks, we propose a novel method called multi-objective evolutionary search of variable-length composite semantic perturbations (MES-VCSP). Specifically, we construct the mathematical model of variable-length composite semantic perturbations, which provides five gradient-based semantic attack methods. The same type of perturbation in an attack sequence is allowed to be performed multiple times. Besides, we introduce the multi-objective evolutionary search consisting of NSGA-II and neighborhood search to find near-optimal variable-length attack sequences.

Although the effect of normalization methods on the performance of EMO algorithms has been investigated in the literature, that of preference-based EMO (PBEMO) algorithms is poorly understood. Since PBEMO aims to approximate a region of interest, its population generally does not cover the Pareto front in the objective space. This property may make normalization of objectives in PBEMO difficult. This paper investigates the effectiveness of three normalization methods in three representative PBEMO algorithms. We present a bounded archive-based method for approximating the nadir point. First, we demonstrate that the normalization methods in PBEMO perform significantly worse than that in conventional EMO in terms of approximating the ideal point, nadir point, and range of the PF. Then, we show that PBEMO requires normalization of objectives on problems with differently scaled objectives.

    "title": "Unpacking polarization: Antagonism and Alignment in Signed Networks of  Online Interaction",
    "abstract": "Online polarization research currently focuses on studying single-issue opinion distributions or computing distance metrics of interaction network structures. Limited data availability often restricts studies to positive interaction data, which can misrepresent the reality of a discussion. We introduce a novel framework that aims at combining these three aspects, content and interactions, as well as their nature (positive or negative), while challenging the prevailing notion of polarization as an umbrella term for all forms of online conflict or opposing opinions. In our approach, built on the concepts of cleavage structures and structural balance of signed social networks, we factorize polarization into two distinct metrics: Antagonism and Alignment. Antagonism quantifies hostility in online discussions, based on the reactions of users to content. Alignment uses signed structural information encoded in long-term user-user relations on the platform to describe how well user interactions fit the global and/or traditional sides of discussion. We can analyse the change of these metrics through time, localizing both relevant trends but also sudden changes that can be mapped to specific contexts or events. We apply our methods to two distinct platforms: Birdwatch, a US crowd-based fact-checking extension of Twitter, and DerStandard, an Austrian online newspaper with discussion forums. In these two use cases, we find that our framework is capable of describing the global status of the groups of users (identification of cleavages) while also providing relevant findings on specific issues or in specific time frames. Furthermore, we show that our four metrics describe distinct phenomena, emphasizing their independent consideration for unpacking polarization complexities. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, the no-box adversarial attack, in which the attacker lacks access to the model's architecture, weights, and training data, become the most practical and challenging attack setup. However, there is an unawareness of the potential and flexibility inherent in the surrogate model selection process on no-box setting. Inspired by the burgeoning interest in utilizing foundational models to address downstream tasks, this paper adopts an innovative idea that 1) recasting adversarial attack as a downstream task. Specifically, image noise generation to meet the emerging trend and 2) introducing foundational models as surrogate models. Harnessing the concept of non-robust features, we elaborate on two guiding principles for surrogate model selection to explain why the foundational model is an optimal choice for this role. However, paradoxically, we observe that these foundational models underperform. Analyzing this unexpected behavior within the feature space, we attribute the lackluster performance of foundational models (e.g., CLIP) to their significant representational capacity and, conversely, their lack of discriminative prowess. To mitigate this issue, we propose the use of a margin-based loss strategy for the fine-tuning of foundational models on target images. The experimental results verify that our approach, which employs the basic Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) attack algorithm, outstrips the performance of other, more convoluted algorithms. We conclude by advocating for the research community to consider surrogate models as crucial determinants in the effectiveness of adversarial attacks in no-box settings. The implications of our work bear relevance for improving the efficacy of such adversarial attacks and the overall robustness of AI systems. ",

    "abstract": "Deception detection is an interdisciplinary field attracting researchers from psychology, criminology, computer science, and economics. We propose a multimodal approach combining deep learning and discriminative models for automated deception detection. Using video modalities, we employ convolutional end-to-end learning to analyze gaze, head pose, and facial expressions, achieving promising results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Due to limited training data, we also utilize discriminative models for deception detection. Although sequence-to-class approaches are explored, discriminative models outperform them due to data scarcity. Our approach is evaluated on five datasets, including a new Rolling-Dice Experiment motivated by economic factors. Results indicate that facial expressions outperform gaze and head pose, and combining modalities with feature selection enhances detection performance. Differences in expressed features across datasets emphasize the importance of scenario-specific training data and the influence of context on deceptive behavior. Cross-dataset experiments reinforce these findings. Despite the challenges posed by low-stake datasets, including the Rolling-Dice Experiment, deception detection performance exceeds chance levels. Our proposed multimodal approach and comprehensive evaluation shed light on the potential of automating deception detection from video modalities, opening avenues for future research. ",

Recently, many attempts have been made by applying the KD mechanism to the graph representation learning models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) to accelerate the model's inference speed via student models. However, many existing KD-based GNNs utilize MLP as a universal approximator in the student model to imitate the teacher model's process without considering the graph knowledge from the teacher model. In this work, we provide a KD-based framework on multi-scaled GNNs, known as graph framelet, and prove that by adequately utilizing the graph knowledge in a multi-scaled manner provided by graph framelet decomposition, the student model is capable of adapting both homophilic and heterophilic graphs and has the potential of alleviating the over-squashing issue with a simple yet effectively graph surgery. Furthermore, we show how the graph knowledge supplied by the teacher is learned and digested by the student model via both algebra and geometry. Comprehensive experiments show that our proposed model can generate learning accuracy identical to or even surpass the teacher model while maintaining the high speed of inference. ",

To apply this philosophy, Hexa-X is designing 6G with three sustainability objectives in mind: to enable the reduction of emissions in 6G-powered sectors of society, to reduce the total cost of ownership and to improve energy efficiency. This paper describes these objectives, their associated KPIs and quantitative targets, and the levers to reach them.

Accordingly, in this work the authors propose a forecasting analysis of crucial QoS/QoE descriptors (some of which neglected in the technical literature) of VoIP traffic in a real mobile environment. The problem is formulated in terms of a multivariate time series analysis. Such a formalization allows to discover and model the temporal relationships among various descriptors and to forecast their behaviors for future periods. Techniques such as Vector Autoregressive models and machine learning (deep-based and tree-based) approaches are employed and compared in terms of performance and time complexity, by reframing the multivariate time series problem into a supervised learning one. Moreover, a series of auxiliary analyses (stationarity, orthogonal impulse responses, etc.) are performed to discover the analytical structure of the time series and to provide deep insights about their relationships. The whole theoretical analysis has an experimental counterpart since a set of trials across a real-world LTE-Advanced environment has been performed to collect, post-process and analyze about 600,000 voice packets, organized per flow and differentiated per codec.

    "abstract": "Heading towards navigational autonomy in unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) in the maritime sector can fundamentally lead towards safer waters as well as reduced operating costs, while also providing a range of exciting new capabilities for oceanic research, exploration and monitoring. However, achieving such a goal is challenging. USV control systems must, safely and reliably, be able to adhere to the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea (COLREGs) in encounters with other vessels as they navigate to a given waypoint while being affected by realistic weather conditions, either during the day or at night. To deal with the multitude of possible scenarios, it is critical to have a virtual environment that is able to replicate the realistic operating conditions USVs will encounter, before they can be implemented in the real world. Such \"digital twins\" form the foundations upon which Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Computer Vision (CV) algorithms can be used to develop and guide USV control systems. In this paper we describe the novel development of a COLREG-compliant DRL-based collision avoidant navigational system with CV-based awareness in a realistic ocean simulation environment. The performance of the trained autonomous Agents resulting from this approach is evaluated in several successful navigations to set waypoints in both open sea and coastal encounters with other vessels.

    "abstract": "Dialog policies, which determine a system's action based on the current state at each dialog turn, are crucial to the success of the dialog. In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising option for dialog policy learning (DPL). In RL-based DPL, dialog policies are updated according to rewards. The manual construction of fine-grained rewards, such as state-action-based ones, to effectively guide the dialog policy is challenging in multi-domain task-oriented dialog scenarios with numerous state-action pair combinations. One way to estimate rewards from collected data is to train the reward estimator and dialog policy simultaneously using adversarial learning (AL). Although this method has demonstrated superior performance experimentally, it is fraught with the inherent problems of AL, such as mode collapse. This paper first identifies the role of AL in DPL through detailed analyses of the objective functions of dialog policy and reward estimator. Next, based on these analyses, we propose a method that eliminates AL from reward estimation and DPL while retaining its advantages. We evaluate our method using MultiWOZ, a multi-domain task-oriented dialog corpus. ",

A typical attack performs intentional cache access and manipulates cache states to leak secrets by observing the victim's cache access patterns. Different countermeasures have been proposed to defend against both general and transient execution based attacks. Despite their effectiveness, they mostly trade some level of performance for security, or have restricted security scope. In this paper, we seek an approach to enforcing security while maintaining performance. We leverage the insight that attackers need to access cache in order to manipulate and observe cache state changes for information leakage. Specifically, we propose Prefender, a secure prefetcher that learns and predicts attack-related accesses for prefetching the cachelines to simultaneously help security and performance. Our results show that Prefender is effective against several cache side channel attacks while maintaining or even improving performance for SPEC CPU 2006 and 2017 benchmarks. ",

    "title": "A Novel Site-Agnostic Multimodal Deep Learning Model to Identify  Pro-Eating Disorder Content on Social Media",
    "abstract": "Over the last decade, there has been a vast increase in eating disorder diagnoses and eating disorder-attributed deaths, reaching their zenith during the Covid-19 pandemic. This immense growth derived in part from the stressors of the pandemic but also from increased exposure to social media, which is rife with content that promotes eating disorders. Such content can induce eating disorders in viewers. This study aimed to create a multimodal deep learning model capable of determining whether a given social media post promotes eating disorders based on a combination of visual and textual data. A labeled dataset of Tweets was collected from Twitter, upon which twelve deep learning models were trained and tested. Based on model performance, the most effective deep learning model was the multimodal fusion of the RoBERTa natural language processing model and the MaxViT image classification model, attaining accuracy and F1 scores of 95.9% and 0.959 respectively. The RoBERTa and MaxViT fusion model, deployed to classify an unlabeled dataset of posts from the social media sites Tumblr and Reddit, generated similar classifications as previous research studies that did not employ artificial intelligence, showing that artificial intelligence can develop insights congruent to those of researchers. Additionally, the model was used to conduct a time-series analysis of yet unseen Tweets from eight Twitter hashtags, uncovering that the relative abundance of pro-eating disorder content has decreased drastically. However, since approximately 2018, pro-eating disorder content has either stopped its decline or risen once more in ampleness. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel algorithm for crack localisation and detection based on visual and tactile analysis via fibre-optics. A finger-shaped sensor based on fibre-optics is employed for the data acquisition to collect data for the analysis and the experiments. To detect the possible locations of cracks a camera is used to scan an environment while running an object detection algorithm. Once the crack is detected, a fully-connected graph is created from a skeletonised version of the crack. A minimum spanning tree is then employed for calculating the shortest path to explore the crack which is then used to develop the motion planner for the robotic manipulator. The motion planner divides the crack into multiple nodes which are then explored individually. Then, the manipulator starts the exploration and performs the tactile data classification to confirm if there is indeed a crack in that location or just a false positive from the vision algorithm. If a crack is detected, also the length, width, orientation and number of branches are calculated. This is repeated until all the nodes of the crack are explored. In order to validate the complete algorithm, various experiments are performed: comparison of exploration of cracks through full scan and motion planning algorithm, implementation of frequency-based features for crack classification and geometry analysis using a combination of vision and tactile data. From the results of the experiments, it is shown that the proposed algorithm is able to detect cracks and improve the results obtained from vision to correctly classify cracks and their geometry with minimal cost thanks to the motion planning algorithm.

In this work we present a method for tracking surgical thread in 3D which is robust to occlusions and complex thread configurations, and apply it to autonomously perform the surgical suture \"tail-shortening\" task: pulling thread through tissue until a desired \"tail\" length remains exposed. The method utilizes a learned 2D surgical thread detection network to segment suturing thread in RGB images. It then identifies the thread path in 2D and reconstructs the thread in 3D as a NURBS spline by triangulating the detections from two stereo cameras. Once a 3D thread model is initialized, the method tracks the thread across subsequent frames. Experiments suggest the method achieves a 1.33 pixel average reprojection error on challenging single-frame 3D thread reconstructions, and an 0.84 pixel average reprojection error on two tracking sequences. On the tail-shortening task, it accomplishes a 90% success rate across 20 trials. Supplemental materials are available at https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/autolab-surgical-thread/ . ",

However, a large scale of network latency estimation requires a lot of computing time. Therefore, we propose a new method that is much faster and maintains high accuracy. The data structure of network nodes can form a matrix, and the tensor model can be formed by introducing the time dimension. Thus, the entire problem can be be summarized as a tensor completion problem. The main idea of our method is improving the tensor leverage sampling strategy and introduce tensor QR decomposition into tensor completion. To achieve faster tensor leverage sampling, we replace tensor singular decomposition (t-SVD) with tensor CSVD-QR to appoximate t-SVD. To achieve faster completion for incomplete tensor, we use the tensor $L_{2,1}$-norm rather than traditional tensor nuclear norm. Furthermore, we introduce tensor QR decomposition into alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Numerical experiments witness that our method is faster than state-of-art algorithms with satisfactory accuracy. ",

In this letter, we first characterize macroscopic traffic flow by considering log-normal distribution of the spacing between CAVs. We then derive novel closed-form expressions for the exact HO-aware rate outage probability and ergodic capacity in a large-scale network with interference. Then, we formulate a traffic flow maximization problem to optimize the speed of CAVs and deployment density of BSs with HO-aware rate constraints and collision avoidance constraints. Our numerical results validate the closed-form analytical expressions, extract useful insights about the optimal speed and BS density, and highlight the key trade-offs between the HO-aware data rates and CAV traffic flow.

Over the years, numerous algorithms have emerged, spanning from rudimentary image processing techniques to sophisticated deep neural networks. The performance of deep learning-based models is highly dependent on the quality of their training data. Consequently, these models often experience a decline in performance when confronted with challenging scenarios such as extreme lighting conditions, partially visible lane markings, and sparse lane markings like Botts' dots. To address this, we present an end-to-end lane detection and classification system based on deep learning methodologies. In our study, we introduce a unique dataset meticulously curated to encompass scenarios that pose significant challenges for state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Through fine-tuning selected models, we aim to achieve enhanced localization accuracy. Moreover, we propose a CNN-based classification branch, seamlessly integrated with the detector, facilitating the identification of distinct lane types. This architecture enables informed lane-changing decisions and empowers more resilient ADAS capabilities. We also investigate the effect of using mixed precision training and testing on different models and batch sizes. Experimental evaluations conducted on the widely-used TuSimple dataset, Caltech lane dataset, and our LVLane dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in accurately detecting and classifying lanes amidst challenging scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art classification results on the TuSimple dataset. The code of the work will be published upon the acceptance of the paper. ",

Recent theoretical studies have shown that shallow neural networks optimized on a single task with gradient-based methods can learn meaningful features, extending our understanding beyond the neural tangent kernel or random feature regime in which negligible feature learning occurs. But in practice, neural networks are increasingly often trained on {\\em many} tasks simultaneously with differing loss functions, and these prior analyses do not generalize to such settings. In the multi-task learning setting, a variety of studies have shown effective feature learning by simple linear models. However, multi-task learning via {\\em nonlinear} models, arguably the most common learning paradigm in practice, remains largely mysterious. In this work, we present the first results proving feature learning occurs in a multi-task setting with a nonlinear model. We show that when the tasks are binary classification problems with labels depending on only $r$ directions within the ambient $d\\gg r$-dimensional input space, executing a simple gradient-based multitask learning algorithm on a two-layer ReLU neural network learns the ground-truth $r$ directions. In particular, any downstream task on the $r$ ground-truth coordinates can be solved by learning a linear classifier with sample and neuron complexity independent of the ambient dimension $d$, while a random feature model requires exponential complexity in $d$ for such a guarantee.

    "abstract": "Joint commitment was argued to \"make our social world\" (Gilbert, 2014) and to separate us from other primates. 'Joint' entails that neither of us promises anything, unless the other promises as well. When we need to coordinate for the best mutual outcome, any commitment is beneficial. However, when we are tempted to free-ride (i.e. in social dilemmas), commitment serves no obvious purpose. We show that a reputation system, which judges action in social dilemmas only after joint commitment, can prevent free-riding. Keeping commitments builds trust. We can selectively enter joint commitments with trustworthy individuals to ensure their cooperation (since they will now be judged). We simply do not commit to cooperate with those we do not trust, and hence can freely defect without losing the trust of others. This principle might be the reason for pointedly public joint commitments, such as marriage. It is especially relevant to our evolutionary past, in which no mechanisms existed to enforce commitments reliably and impartially (e.g. via a powerful and accountable government). Much research from anthropology, philosophy and psychology made the assumption that past collaborations were mutually beneficial and had little possibilities to free-ride, for which there is little support. Our evolutionary game theory approach proves that this assumption is not necessary, because free-riding could have been dealt with joint commitments and reputation. ",

UAVs have the capability to operate virtually everywhere, and the growing payload capacity makes them suitable platforms to carry wireless communications hardware.

On the other hand, current link adaptation algorithms are mainly targeting fixed or low mobility scenarios.

As in many other deep learning approaches, the choice of PINN design and training protocol requires careful craftsmanship.

Leveraging an equivalence between infinitely over-parameterized neural networks and Gaussian process regression (GPR), we derive an integro-differential equation that governs PINN prediction in the large data-set limit -- the Neurally-Informed Equation (NIE). This equation augments the original one by a kernel term reflecting architecture choices and allows quantifying implicit bias induced by the network via a spectral decomposition of the source term in the original differential equation.

    "abstract": "Bayesian network (BN) structure discovery algorithms typically either make assumptions about the sparsity of the true underlying network, or are limited by computational constraints to networks with a small number of variables. While these sparsity assumptions can take various forms, frequently the assumptions focus on an upper bound for the maximum in-degree of the underlying graph $\\nabla_G$. Theorem 2 in Duttweiler et. al. (2023) demonstrates that the largest eigenvalue of the normalized inverse covariance matrix ($\\Omega$) of a linear BN is a lower bound for $\\nabla_G$. Building on this result, this paper provides the asymptotic properties of, and a debiasing procedure for, the sample eigenvalues of $\\Omega$, leading to a hypothesis test that may be used to determine if the BN has max in-degree greater than 1. A linear BN structure discovery workflow is suggested in which the investigator uses this hypothesis test to aid in selecting an appropriate structure discovery algorithm. The hypothesis test performance is evaluated through simulations and the workflow is demonstrated on data from a human psoriasis study. ",

    "abstract": "For predictive modeling relying on Bayesian inversion, fully independent, or ``mean-field'', Gaussian distributions are often used as approximate probability density functions in variational inference since the number of variational parameters is twice the number of unknown model parameters. The resulting diagonal covariance structure coupled with unimodal behavior can be too restrictive when dealing with highly non-Gaussian behavior, including multimodality. High-fidelity surrogate posteriors in the form of Gaussian mixtures can capture any distribution to an arbitrary degree of accuracy while maintaining some analytical tractability. Variational inference with Gaussian mixtures with full-covariance structures suffers from a quadratic growth in variational parameters with the number of model parameters. Coupled with the existence of multiple local minima due to nonconvex trends in the loss functions often associated with variational inference, these challenges motivate the need for robust initialization procedures to improve the performance and scalability of variational inference with mixture models. In this work, we propose a method for constructing an initial Gaussian mixture model approximation that can be used to warm-start the iterative solvers for variational inference. The procedure begins with an optimization stage in model parameter space in which local gradient-based optimization, globalized through multistart, is used to determine a set of local maxima, which we take to approximate the mixture component centers. Around each mode, a local Gaussian approximation is constructed via the Laplace method. Finally, the mixture weights are determined through constrained least squares regression. Robustness and scalability are demonstrated using synthetic tests. The methodology is applied to an inversion problem in structural dynamics involving unknown viscous damping coefficients. ",

We consider a generalization of the discrete-time coined quantum walk model that accounts for the interaction between quantum walks in the network graph with quantum registers inside the network nodes. QWCP allows for the implementation of networked quantum services, such as distributed quantum computing and entanglement distribution, abstracting hardware implementation and the transmission of quantum information through channels. Multiple interacting quantum walks can be used to propagate entangled control signals across the network in parallel. We demonstrate how to use QWCP to perform distributed multi-qubit controlled gates, which shows the universality of the protocol for distributed quantum computing.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death and early diagnosis is associated with a positive prognosis. Chest X-ray (CXR) provides an inexpensive imaging mode for lung cancer diagnosis. Suspicious nodules are difficult to distinguish from vascular and bone structures using CXR. Computer vision has previously been proposed to assist human radiologists in this task, however, leading studies use down-sampled images and computationally expensive methods with unproven generalization. Instead, this study localizes lung nodules using efficient encoder-decoder neural networks that process full resolution images to avoid any signal loss resulting from down-sampling. Encoder-decoder networks are trained and tested using the JSRT lung nodule dataset. The networks are used to localize lung nodules from an independent external CXR dataset. Sensitivity and false positive rates are measured using an automated framework to eliminate any observer subjectivity. These experiments allow for the determination of the optimal network depth, image resolution and pre-processing pipeline for generalized lung nodule localization. We find that nodule localization is influenced by subtlety, with more subtle nodules being detected in earlier training epochs. Therefore, we propose a novel self-ensemble model from three consecutive epochs centered on the validation optimum. This ensemble achieved a sensitivity of 85% in 10-fold internal testing with false positives of 8 per image. A sensitivity of 81% is achieved at a false positive rate of 6 following morphological false positive reduction. This result is comparable to more computationally complex systems based on linear and spatial filtering, but with a sub-second inference time that is faster than other methods. The proposed algorithm achieved excellent generalization results against an external dataset with sensitivity of 77% at a false positive rate of 7.6. ",

The dataset obtained from individual gases and their mixtures were analyzed using multiple machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine. KNN and RF have shown more than 99% accuracy in classifying different varying chemicals in the gas mixtures. In regression analysis, KNN has delivered the best results with R2 value of more than 0.99 and LOD of 0.012, 0.015, 0.014 and 0.025 PPM for predicting the concentrations of varying chemicals Acetone, Toluene, Ethanol, and Chloroform, respectively in complex mixtures.

Thus, the proposed DNN-FM is trained by using a negative profiled h-likelihood as a loss function, constructed by profiling out the non-parametric baseline hazard. Experimental studies show that the proposed method enhances the prediction performance of the existing methods.

    "abstract": "The presence of coherent noise in seismic data leads to errors and uncertainties, and as such it is paramount to suppress noise as early and efficiently as possible. Self-supervised denoising circumvents the common requirement of deep learning procedures of having noisy-clean training pairs. However, self-supervised coherent noise suppression methods require extensive knowledge of the noise statistics. We propose the use of explainable artificial intelligence approaches to see inside the black box that is the denoising network and use the gained knowledge to replace the need for any prior knowledge of the noise itself. This is achieved in practice by leveraging bias-free networks and the direct linear link between input and output provided by the associated Jacobian matrix; we show that a simple averaging of the Jacobian contributions over a number of randomly selected input pixels, provides an indication of the most effective mask to suppress noise present in the data. The proposed method therefore becomes a fully automated denoising procedure requiring no clean training labels or prior knowledge. Realistic synthetic examples with noise signals of varying complexities, ranging from simple time-correlated noise to complex pseudo rig noise propagating at the velocity of the ocean, are used to validate the proposed approach. Its automated nature is highlighted further by an application to two field datasets. Without any substantial pre-processing or any knowledge of the acquisition environment, the automatically identified blind-masks are shown to perform well in suppressing both trace-wise noise in common shot gathers from the Volve marine dataset and colored noise in post stack seismic images from a land seismic survey.

These applications raise the question of how to train the weights in a recurrent neural network to minimize a loss function evaluated on fixed points. A natural approach is to use gradient descent on the Euclidean space of synaptic weights. We show that this approach can lead to poor learning performance due, in part, to singularities that arise in the loss surface. We use a re-parameterization of the recurrent network model to derive two alternative learning rules that produces more robust learning dynamics. We show that these learning rules can be interpreted as steepest descent and gradient descent, respectively, under a non-Euclidean metric on the space of recurrent weights. Our results question the common, implicit assumption that learning in the brain should necessarily follow the negative Euclidean gradient of synaptic weights. ",

However, their robustness against the growing complexity of internet-of-thing (IoT) networks and diverse jamming attacks is still limited. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML)-based techniques have emerged as promising solutions. By offering adaptive and intelligent anti-jamming capabilities, ML-based approaches can effectively adapt to dynamic attack scenarios and overcome the limitations of traditional methods. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach that utilizes state input from realistic wireless network interface cards. We train five different variants of deep Q-network (DQN) agents to mitigate the effects of jamming with the aim of identifying the most sample-efficient, lightweight, robust, and least complex agent that is tailored for power-constrained devices. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DRL-based anti-jamming approach against proactive jammers, regardless of their jamming strategy which eliminates the need for a pattern recognition or jamming strategy detection step. Our findings present a promising solution for securing IoT networks against jamming attacks and highlights substantial opportunities for continued investigation and advancement within this field. ",
