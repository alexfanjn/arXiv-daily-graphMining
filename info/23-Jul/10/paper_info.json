    "abstract": "Distributed Collaborative Machine Learning (DCML) is a potential alternative to address the privacy concerns associated with centralized machine learning. The Split learning (SL) and Federated Learning (FL) are the two effective learning approaches in DCML. Recently there have been an increased interest on the hybrid of FL and SL known as the SplitFed Learning (SFL). This research is the earliest attempt to study, analyze and present the impact of data poisoning attacks in SFL. We propose three kinds of novel attack strategies namely untargeted, targeted and distance-based attacks for SFL. All the attacks strategies aim to degrade the performance of the DCML-based classifier. We test the proposed attack strategies for two different case studies on Electrocardiogram signal classification and automatic handwritten digit recognition. A series of attack experiments were conducted by varying the percentage of malicious clients and the choice of the model split layer between the clients and the server. The results after the comprehensive analysis of attack strategies clearly convey that untargeted and distance-based poisoning attacks have greater impacts in evading the classifier outcomes compared to targeted attacks in SFL ",

To address the challenges, we propose a Region-Wise Multi-View Representation Learning (ROMER) to capture multi-view dependencies and learn expressive representations of urban regions without the constraints of rigid neighbourhood region conditions. Our model focus on learn urban region representation from multi-source urban data. First, we capture the multi-view correlations from mobility flow patterns, POI semantics and check-in dynamics. Then, we adopt global graph attention networks to learn similarity of any two vertices in graphs. To comprehensively consider and share features of multiple views, a two-stage fusion module is further proposed to learn weights with external attention to fuse multi-view embeddings. Extensive experiments for two downstream tasks on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 17\\% improvement. ",

    "abstract": "Quantifying uncertainty is important for actionable predictions in real-world applications. A crucial part of predictive uncertainty quantification is the estimation of epistemic uncertainty, which is defined as an integral of the product between a divergence function and the posterior. Current methods such as Deep Ensembles or MC dropout underperform at estimating the epistemic uncertainty, since they primarily consider the posterior when sampling models. We suggest Quantification of Uncertainty with Adversarial Models (QUAM) to better estimate the epistemic uncertainty. QUAM identifies regions where the whole product under the integral is large, not just the posterior. Consequently, QUAM has lower approximation error of the epistemic uncertainty compared to previous methods. Models for which the product is large correspond to adversarial models (not adversarial examples!). Adversarial models have both a high posterior as well as a high divergence between their predictions and that of a reference model. Our experiments show that QUAM excels in capturing epistemic uncertainty for deep learning models and outperforms previous methods on challenging tasks in the vision domain. ",

They consider an unsupervised setting, specifically the one-class setting, in which we assume the availability of a set of normal (\\textit{i.e.}, anomaly-free) images for training. In this paper, we consider a more challenging scenario of unsupervised AD, in which we detect anomalies in a given set of images that might contain both normal and anomalous samples. The setting does not assume the availability of known normal data and thus is completely free from human annotation, which differs from the standard AD considered in recent studies. For clarity, we call the setting blind anomaly detection (BAD). We show that BAD can be converted into a local outlier detection problem and propose a novel method named PatchCluster that can accurately detect image- and pixel-level anomalies. Experimental results show that PatchCluster shows a promising performance without the knowledge of normal data, even comparable to the SOTA methods applied in the one-class setting needing it. ",

    "abstract": "Statistical shape models (SSM) have been well-established as an excellent tool for identifying variations in the morphology of anatomy across the underlying population. Shape models use consistent shape representation across all the samples in a given cohort, which helps to compare shapes and identify the variations that can detect pathologies and help in formulating treatment plans. In medical imaging, computing these shape representations from CT/MRI scans requires time-intensive preprocessing operations, including but not limited to anatomy segmentation annotations, registration, and texture denoising. Deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in learning shape representations directly from volumetric images, giving rise to highly effective and efficient Image-to-SSM. Nevertheless, these models are data-hungry and due to the limited availability of medical data, deep learning models tend to overfit. Offline data augmentation techniques, that use kernel density estimation based (KDE) methods for generating shape-augmented samples, have successfully aided Image-to-SSM networks in achieving comparable accuracy to traditional SSM methods. However, these augmentation methods focus on shape augmentation, whereas deep learning models exhibit texture bias results in sub-optimal models. This paper introduces a novel strategy for on-the-fly data augmentation for the Image-to-SSM framework by leveraging data-dependent noise generation or texture augmentation. The proposed framework is trained as an adversary to the Image-to-SSM network, augmenting diverse and challenging noisy samples. Our approach achieves improved accuracy by encouraging the model to focus on the underlying geometry rather than relying solely on pixel values. ",

    "abstract": "Complex optimal design and control processes often require repeated evaluations of expensive objective functions and consist of large design spaces. Data-driven surrogates such as neural networks and Gaussian processes provide an attractive alternative to simulations and are utilized frequently to represent these objective functions in optimization. However, pure data-driven models, due to a lack of adherence to basic physics laws and constraints, are often poor at generalizing and extrapolating. This is particularly the case, when training occurs over sparse high-fidelity datasets. A class of Physics-infused machine learning (PIML) models integrate ML models with low-fidelity partial physics models to improve generalization performance while retaining computational efficiency. This paper presents two potential approaches for Physics infused modelling of aircraft aerodynamics which incorporate Artificial Neural Networks with a low-fidelity Vortex Lattice Method model with blown wing effects (BLOFI) to improve prediction performance while also keeping the computational cost tractable. This paper also develops an end-to-end auto differentiable open-source framework that enables efficient training of such hybrid models. These two PIML modelling approaches are then used to predict the aerodynamic coefficients of a 6 rotor eVTOL aircraft given its control parameters and flight conditions. The models are trained on a sparse high-fidelity dataset generated using a CHARM model. The trained models are then compared against the vanilla low-fidelity model and a standard pure data-driven ANN. Our results show that one of the proposed architectures outperforms all the other models at a nominal increase in run time. These results are promising and pave way for PIML frameworks which can generalize over different aircraft and configurations thereby significantly reducing costs of design and control. ",

However, the proper treatment decision has been the subject of significant debate and it remains controversial about who benefits from this scarcely available and technically complex treatment option. To support clinical decisions, it is a critical need to predict the treatment need and the potential treatment and no-treatment responses. Targeting this clinical challenge, we propose Treatment Variational AutoEncoder (TVAE), a novel approach for individualized treatment analysis. TVAE is specifically designed to address the modeling challenges like ECMO with strong treatment selection bias and scarce treatment cases. TVAE conceptualizes the treatment decision as a multi-scale problem. We model a patient's potential treatment assignment and the factual and counterfactual outcomes as part of their intrinsic characteristics that can be represented by a deep latent variable model. The factual and counterfactual prediction errors are alleviated via a reconstruction regularization scheme together with semi-supervision, and the selection bias and the scarcity of treatment cases are mitigated by the disentangled and distribution-matched latent space and the label-balancing generative strategy. We evaluate TVAE on two real-world COVID-19 datasets: an international dataset collected from 1651 hospitals across 63 countries, and a institutional dataset collected from 15 hospitals. The results show that TVAE outperforms state-of-the-art treatment effect models in predicting both the propensity scores and factual outcomes on heterogeneous COVID-19 datasets. Additional experiments also show TVAE outperforms the best existing models in individual treatment effect estimation on the synthesized IHDP benchmark dataset. ",

Research has been shown that face and speaker recognition can be performed in a mobile environment. Facial landmark localization aims at finding the coordinates of a set of pre-defined key points for 2D face images. A facial landmark usually has specific semantic meaning, e.g. nose tip or eye centre, which provides rich geometric information for other face analysis tasks such as face recognition, emotion estimation and 3D face reconstruction. Pretty much facial landmark detection methods adopt still face databases, such as 300W, AFW, AFLW, or COFW, for evaluation, but seldomly use mobile data. Our work is first to perform facial landmark detection evaluation on the mobile still data, i.e., face images from MOBIO database. About 20,600 face images have been extracted from this audio-visual database and manually labeled with 22 landmarks as the groundtruth. Several state-of-the-art facial landmark detection methods are adopted to evaluate their performance on these data. The result shows that the data from MOBIO database is pretty challenging.

Current approaches extract longitudinal information from patient EHR to personalize recommendations. However, existing models often lack sufficient patient representation and overlook the importance of considering the similarity between a patient's medication records and specific medicines. Therefore, an Attention-guided Collaborative Decision Network (ACDNet) for medication recommendation is proposed in this paper. Specifically, ACDNet utilizes attention mechanism and Transformer to effectively capture patient health conditions and medication records by modeling their historical visits at both global and local levels. ACDNet also employs a collaborative decision framework, utilizing the similarity between medication records and medicine representation to facilitate the recommendation process. The experimental results on two extensive medical datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, clearly demonstrate that ACDNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of Jaccard, PR-AUC, and F1 score, reaffirming its superiority. Moreover, the ablation experiments provide solid evidence of the effectiveness of each module in ACDNet, validating their contribution to the overall performance. Furthermore, a detailed case study reinforces the effectiveness of ACDNet in medication recommendation based on EHR data, showcasing its practical value in real-world healthcare scenarios. ",

However, challenges such as label scarcity and data heterogeneity render stress prediction difficult in practice. To counter these issues, we have developed a multimodal personalized stress prediction system using wearable biosignal data. We employ self-supervised learning (SSL) to pre-train the models on each subject's data, allowing the models to learn the baseline dynamics of the participant's biosignals prior to fine-tuning the stress prediction task. We test our model on the Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD) dataset, demonstrating that our SSL models outperform non-SSL models while utilizing less than 5% of the annotations. These results suggest that our approach can personalize stress prediction to each user with minimal annotations. This paradigm has the potential to enable personalized prediction of a variety of recurring health events using complex multimodal data streams. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, open-vocabulary (OV) object detection has attracted increasing research attention. Unlike traditional detection, which only recognizes fixed-category objects, OV detection aims to detect objects in an open category set. Previous works often leverage vision-language (VL) training data (e.g., referring grounding data) to recognize OV objects. However, they only use pairs of nouns and individual objects in VL data, while these data usually contain much more information, such as scene graphs, which are also crucial for OV detection. In this paper, we propose a novel Scene-Graph-Based Discovery Network (SGDN) that exploits scene graph cues for OV detection. Firstly, a scene-graph-based decoder (SGDecoder) including sparse scene-graph-guided attention (SSGA) is presented. It captures scene graphs and leverages them to discover OV objects. Secondly, we propose scene-graph-based prediction (SGPred), where we build a scene-graph-based offset regression (SGOR) mechanism to enable mutual enhancement between scene graph extraction and object localization. Thirdly, we design a cross-modal learning mechanism in SGPred. It takes scene graphs as bridges to improve the consistency between cross-modal embeddings for OV object classification. Experiments on COCO and LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we show the ability of our model for OV scene graph detection, while previous OV scene graph generation methods cannot tackle this task. ",

In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to determine the factors contributing to a successful rebuttal using over 3,000 papers and 13,000 reviews from ICLR2022, one of the most prestigious computer science conferences.

Subsequently, we evaluate several quantifiable author rebuttal strategies and their effects on review scores. These strategies can help authors in improving their review scores. Finally, we used machine learning models to predict rebuttal success and validated the impact of potential factors analyzed in this paper. Our experiments demonstrate that the utilization of all features proposed in this study can aid in predicting the success of the rebuttal.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novelty approach to mitigate the negative transfer problem. In the field of machine learning, the common strategy is to apply the Single-Task Learning approach in order to train a supervised model to solve a specific task. Training a robust model requires a lot of data and a significant amount of computational resources, making this solution unfeasible in cases where data are unavailable or expensive to gather. Therefore another solution, based on the sharing of information between tasks, has been developed: Multi-Task Learning (MTL). Despite the recent developments regarding MTL, the problem of negative transfer has still to be solved. Negative transfer is a phenomenon that occurs when noisy information is shared between tasks, resulting in a drop in performance. This paper proposes a new approach to mitigate the negative transfer problem based on the task awareness concept. The proposed approach results in diminishing the negative transfer together with an improvement of performance over classic MTL solution. Moreover, the proposed approach has been implemented in two unified architectures to detect Sexism, Hate Speech, and Toxic Language in text comments. The proposed architectures set a new state-of-the-art both in EXIST-2021 and HatEval-2019 benchmarks. ",

To help mitigate this, some initial work has been done to detect toxic comments in the Software Engineering (SE) domain. Aims: Since automatically classifying an entire text as toxic or non-toxic does not help human moderators to understand the specific reason(s) for toxicity, we worked to develop an explainable toxicity detector for the SE domain. Method: Our explainable toxicity detector can detect specific spans of toxic content from SE texts, which can help human moderators by automatically highlighting those spans. This toxic span detection model, ToxiSpanSE, is trained with the 19,651 code review (CR) comments with labeled toxic spans. Our annotators labeled the toxic spans within 3,757 toxic CR samples. We explored several types of models, including one lexicon-based approach and five different transformer-based encoders. Results: After an extensive evaluation of all models, we found that our fine-tuned RoBERTa model achieved the best score with 0.88 $F1$, 0.87 precision, and 0.93 recall for toxic class tokens, providing an explainable toxicity classifier for the SE domain. Conclusion: Since ToxiSpanSE is the first tool to detect toxic spans in the SE domain, this tool will pave a path to combat toxicity in the SE community. ",

In this paper, we aim to explore the potential of LLMs in graph machine learning, especially the node classification task, and investigate two possible pipelines: LLMs-as-Enhancers and LLMs-as-Predictors. The former leverages LLMs to enhance nodes' text attributes with their massive knowledge and then generate predictions through GNNs. The latter attempts to directly employ LLMs as standalone predictors. We conduct comprehensive and systematical studies on these two pipelines under various settings. From comprehensive empirical results, we make original observations and find new insights that open new possibilities and suggest promising directions to leverage LLMs for learning on graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Recommender systems have been acknowledged as efficacious tools for managing information overload. Nevertheless, conventional algorithms adopted in such systems primarily emphasize precise recommendations and, consequently, overlook other vital aspects like the coverage, diversity, and novelty of items. This approach results in less exposure for long-tail items. In this paper, to personalize the recommendations and allocate recommendation resources more purposively, a method named PIM+RA is proposed. This method utilizes a bipartite network that incorporates self-connecting edges and weights. Furthermore, an improved Pearson correlation coefficient is employed for better redistribution. The evaluation of PIM+RA demonstrates a significant enhancement not only in accuracy but also in coverage, diversity, and novelty of the recommendation. It leads to a better balance in recommendation frequency by providing effective exposure to long-tail items, while allowing customized parameters to adjust the recommendation list bias. ",

Our proposed method takes token representations from the self-supervised ViT and leverages their correlations, via self-attention, to produce classification and segmentation predictions through separate task heads. Our model is able to effectively learn to perform classification and segmentation in the absence of pixel-level labels during training, using only image-level labels. To do this it uses attention maps, created from tokens generated by the self-supervised ViT backbone, as pixel-level pseudo-labels. We also explore a practical setup with ``mixed\" supervision, where a small number of training images contains ground-truth pixel-level labels and the remaining images have only image-level labels. For this mixed setup, we propose to improve the pseudo-labels using a pseudo-label enhancer that was trained using the available ground-truth pixel-level labels. Experiments on Pascal-5i and COCO-20i demonstrate significant performance gains in a variety of supervision settings, and in particular when little-to-no pixel-level labels are available. ",

    "abstract": "Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) focuses on classifying samples of unseen classes with only their side semantic information presented during training. It cannot handle real-life, open-world scenarios where there are test samples of unknown classes for which neither samples (e.g., images) nor their side semantic information is known during training. Open-Set Recognition (OSR) is dedicated to addressing the unknown class issue, but existing OSR methods are not designed to model the semantic information of the unseen classes. To tackle this combined ZSL and OSR problem, we consider the case of \"Zero-Shot Open-Set Recognition\" (ZS-OSR), where a model is trained under the ZSL setting but it is required to accurately classify samples from the unseen classes while being able to reject samples from the unknown classes during inference. We perform large experiments on combining existing state-of-the-art ZSL and OSR models for the ZS-OSR task on four widely used datasets adapted from the ZSL task, and reveal that ZS-OSR is a non-trivial task as the simply combined solutions perform badly in distinguishing the unseen-class and unknown-class samples. We further introduce a novel approach specifically designed for ZS-OSR, in which our model learns to generate adversarial semantic embeddings of the unknown classes to train an unknowns-informed ZS-OSR classifier. Extensive empirical results show that our method 1) substantially outperforms the combined solutions in detecting the unknown classes while retaining the classification accuracy on the unseen classes and 2) achieves similar superiority under generalized ZS-OSR settings.

Deep registration methods based on deep learning have been widely recognized for their capabilities to perform fast end-to-end registration. Many deep registration methods achieved state-of-the-art performance by performing coarse-to-fine registration, where multiple registration steps were iterated with cascaded networks. Recently, Non-Iterative Coarse-to-finE (NICE) registration methods have been proposed to perform coarse-to-fine registration in a single network and showed advantages in both registration accuracy and runtime. However, existing NICE registration methods mainly focus on deformable registration, while affine registration, a common prerequisite, is still reliant on time-consuming traditional optimization-based methods or extra affine registration networks. In addition, existing NICE registration methods are limited by the intrinsic locality of convolution operations. Transformers may address this limitation for their capabilities to capture long-range dependency, but the benefits of using transformers for NICE registration have not been explored. In this study, we propose a Non-Iterative Coarse-to-finE Transformer network (NICE-Trans) for image registration. Our NICE-Trans is the first deep registration method that (i) performs joint affine and deformable coarse-to-fine registration within a single network, and (ii) embeds transformers into a NICE registration framework to model long-range relevance between images. Extensive experiments with seven public datasets show that our NICE-Trans outperforms state-of-the-art registration methods on both registration accuracy and runtime. ",

As a result, we propose IA-VFDnet, a CNN-Transformer hybrid learning framework with a unified high-quality multimodal feature matching module (AKM) and a fusion module (WDAF), in which AKM and DWDAF work in synergy to perform high-quality infrared-aware visible fusion detection, which can be applied to smoke and wildfire detection. Furthermore, experiments on the M3FD dataset validate the superiority of the proposed method, with IA-VFDnet achieving the best detection performance than other state-of-the-art methods under conventional registered conditions.

In this paper, we propose deep network steganography for the covert communication of DNN models. Unlike the existing steganography schemes which focus on the subtle modification of the cover data to accommodate the secrets, our scheme is learning task oriented, where the learning task of the secret DNN model (termed as secret-learning task) is disguised into another ordinary learning task conducted in a stego DNN model (termed as stego-learning task). To this end, we propose a gradient-based filter insertion scheme to insert interference filters into the important positions in the secret DNN model to form a stego DNN model. These positions are then embedded into the stego DNN model using a key by side information hiding. Finally, we activate the interference filters by a partial optimization strategy, such that the generated stego DNN model works on the stego-learning task. We conduct the experiments on both the intra-task steganography and inter-task steganography (i.e., the secret and stego-learning tasks belong to the same and different categories), both of which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method for covert communication of DNN models.

In this way, the model can fulfill convexity conditions stemming from mechanical considerations without being too restrictive on the functional relationship in additional parameters, which may not necessarily be convex. Two different models are introduced, where one can represent arbitrary functional relationships in the additional parameters, while the other is monotonic in the additional parameters. As a first proof of concept, the model is calibrated to data generated with two differently parametrised analytical potentials, whereby three different pICNN architectures are investigated. In all cases, the proposed model shows excellent performance. ",

Patient-worn accelerometers can capture information on the patient's movement during these episodes and machine learning algorithms can potentially classify this data. The combination therefore holds the potential to detect FOG in real-time. In this work I present a simple 1-D convolutional neural network that was trained to detect FOG events in accelerometer data. Model performance was assessed by measuring the success of the model to discriminate normal movement from FOG episodes and resulted in a mean average precision of 0.356 on the private leaderboard on Kaggle. Ultimately, the model ranked 8th out of 1379 teams in the Parkinson's Freezing of Gait Prediction competition.

    "abstract": "Multi-view clustering (MVC), which effectively fuses information from multiple views for better performance, has received increasing attention. Most existing MVC methods assume that multi-view data are fully paired, which means that the mappings of all corresponding samples between views are pre-defined or given in advance. However, the data correspondence is often incomplete in real-world applications due to data corruption or sensor differences, referred as the data-unpaired problem (DUP) in multi-view literature. Although several attempts have been made to address the DUP issue, they suffer from the following drawbacks: 1) Most methods focus on the feature representation while ignoring the structural information of multi-view data, which is essential for clustering tasks; 2) Existing methods for partially unpaired problems rely on pre-given cross-view alignment information, resulting in their inability to handle fully unpaired problems; 3) Their inevitable parameters degrade the efficiency and applicability of the models. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel parameter-free graph clustering framework termed Unpaired Multi-view Graph Clustering framework with Cross-View Structure Matching (UPMGC-SM). Specifically, unlike the existing methods, UPMGC-SM effectively utilizes the structural information from each view to refine cross-view correspondences. Besides, our UPMGC-SM is a unified framework for both the fully and partially unpaired multi-view graph clustering. Moreover, existing graph clustering methods can adopt our UPMGC-SM to enhance their ability for unpaired scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed framework for both paired and unpaired datasets. ",

The usage of forwarding can add plausible deniability and the source obfuscation provides additional protection against passive observers.

Lanes can present difficulties for detection, as they can be narrow, fragmented, and often obscured by heavy traffic. However, it has been observed that the lanes have a geometrical structure that resembles a straight line, leading to improved lane detection results when utilizing this characteristic. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical Deep Hough Transform (DHT) approach that combines all lane features in an image into the Hough parameter space. Additionally, we refine the point selection method and incorporate a Dynamic Convolution Module to effectively differentiate between lanes in the original image. Our network architecture comprises a backbone network, either a ResNet or Pyramid Vision Transformer, a Feature Pyramid Network as the neck to extract multi-scale features, and a hierarchical DHT-based feature aggregation head to accurately segment each lane. By utilizing the lane features in the Hough parameter space, the network learns dynamic convolution kernel parameters corresponding to each lane, allowing the Dynamic Convolution Module to effectively differentiate between lane features. Subsequently, the lane features are fed into the feature decoder, which predicts the final position of the lane. Our proposed network structure demonstrates improved performance in detecting heavily occluded or worn lane images, as evidenced by our extensive experimental results, which show that our method outperforms or is on par with state-of-the-art techniques.

We use these recovery algorithms to improve upon and solve new problems in numerical linear algebra and combinatorial optimization on white-box adversarial streams. For example, we give the first efficient algorithm for outputting a matching in a graph with insertions and deletions to its edges provided the matching size is small, and otherwise we declare the matching size is large.

Recently, researchers attempt to adopt attention mechanisms or composite connections for improving the feature representation of detectors. However, this solution does \\textit{not} eliminate the impact of degradation on image content such as color and texture, achieving minimal improvements. Another feasible solution for underwater object detection is to develop sophisticated deep architectures in order to enhance image quality or features. Nevertheless, the visually appealing output of these enhancement modules do \\textit{not} necessarily generate high accuracy for deep detectors. More recently, some multi-task learning methods jointly learn underwater detection and image enhancement, accessing promising improvements. Typically, these methods invoke huge architecture and expensive computations, rendering inefficient inference. Definitely, underwater object detection and image enhancement are two interrelated tasks. Leveraging information coming from the two tasks can benefit each task. Based on these factual opinions, we propose a bilevel optimization formulation for jointly learning underwater object detection and image enhancement, and then unroll to a dual perception network (DPNet) for the two tasks. DPNet with one shared module and two task subnets learns from the two different tasks, seeking a shared representation. The shared representation provides more structural details for image enhancement and rich content information for object detection. Finally, we derive a cooperative training strategy to optimize parameters for DPNet. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic underwater datasets demonstrate that our method outputs visually favoring images and higher detection accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "The existing internet-scale image and video datasets cover a wide range of everyday objects and tasks, bringing the potential of learning policies that have broad generalization. Prior works have explored visual pre-training with different self-supervised objectives, but the generalization capabilities of the learned policies remain relatively unknown. In this work, we take the first step towards this challenge, focusing on how pre-trained representations can help the generalization of the learned policies. We first identify the key bottleneck in using a frozen pre-trained visual backbone for policy learning. We then propose SpawnNet, a novel two-stream architecture that learns to fuse pre-trained multi-layer representations into a separate network to learn a robust policy. Through extensive simulated and real experiments, we demonstrate significantly better categorical generalization compared to prior approaches in imitation learning settings. ",

    "abstract": "Multimodal knowledge graphs (MKGs), which intuitively organize information in various modalities, can benefit multiple practical downstream tasks, such as recommendation systems, and visual question answering. However, most MKGs are still far from complete, which motivates the flourishing of MKG reasoning models. Recently, with the development of general artificial architectures, the pretrained transformer models have drawn increasing attention, especially for multimodal scenarios. However, the research of multimodal pretrained transformer (MPT) for knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) is still at an early stage. As the biggest difference between MKG and other multimodal data, the rich structural information underlying the MKG still cannot be fully leveraged in existing MPT models. Most of them only utilize the graph structure as a retrieval map for matching images and texts connected with the same entity. This manner hinders their reasoning performances. To this end, we propose the graph Structure Guided Multimodal Pretrained Transformer for knowledge graph reasoning, termed SGMPT. Specifically, the graph structure encoder is adopted for structural feature encoding. Then, a structure-guided fusion module with two different strategies, i.e., weighted summation and alignment constraint, is first designed to inject the structural information into both the textual and visual features. To the best of our knowledge, SGMPT is the first MPT model for multimodal KGR, which mines the structural information underlying the knowledge graph. Extensive experiments on FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG, demonstrate that our SGMPT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, and prove the effectiveness of the designed strategies. ",

    "abstract": "Encoder-decoder deep neural networks have been increasingly studied for multi-horizon time series forecasting, especially in real-world applications. However, to forecast accurately, these sophisticated models typically rely on a large number of time series examples with substantial history. A rapidly growing topic of interest is forecasting time series which lack sufficient historical data -- often referred to as the ``cold start'' problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel yet simple method to address this problem by leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) as a data augmentation for enhancing the encoder used by such forecasters. These GNN-based features can capture complex inter-series relationships, and their generation process can be optimized end-to-end with the forecasting task. We show that our architecture can use either data-driven or domain knowledge-defined graphs, scaling to incorporate information from multiple very large graphs with millions of nodes. In our target application of demand forecasting for a large e-commerce retailer, we demonstrate on both a small dataset of 100K products and a large dataset with over 2 million products that our method improves overall performance over competitive baseline models. More importantly, we show that it brings substantially more gains to ``cold start'' products such as those newly launched or recently out-of-stock. ",

    "abstract": "Wearable sensor-based Human Action Recognition (HAR) has made significant strides in recent times. However, the accuracy performance of wearable sensor-based HAR is currently still lagging behind that of visual modalities-based systems, such as RGB video and depth data. Although diverse input modalities can provide complementary cues and improve the accuracy performance of HAR, wearable devices can only capture limited kinds of non-visual time series input, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. This limitation hinders the deployment of multimodal simultaneously using visual and non-visual modality data in parallel on current wearable devices. To address this issue, we propose a novel Physical-aware Cross-modal Adversarial (PCA) framework that utilizes only time-series accelerometer data from four inertial sensors for the wearable sensor-based HAR problem. Specifically, we propose an effective IMU2SKELETON network to produce corresponding synthetic skeleton joints from accelerometer data. Subsequently, we imposed additional constraints on the synthetic skeleton data from a physical perspective, as accelerometer data can be regarded as the second derivative of the skeleton sequence coordinates. After that, the original accelerometer as well as the constrained skeleton sequence were fused together to make the final classification. In this way, when individuals wear wearable devices, the devices can not only capture accelerometer data, but can also generate synthetic skeleton sequences for real-time wearable sensor-based HAR applications that need to be conducted anytime and anywhere. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed PCA framework, we conduct extensive experiments on Berkeley-MHAD, UTD-MHAD, and MMAct datasets. The results confirm that the proposed PCA approach has competitive performance compared to the previous methods on the mono sensor-based HAR classification problem. ",

The uncertainty calls for online learning, which suffers however from the curse of dimensionality. To achieve sample efficiency, we describe the network processes with an adaptive graph dictionary model, which typically leads to sparse spectral representations. This enables a data-efficient learning framework, whose learning rate scales with the dimension of the spectral representation model instead of the one of the network. We then propose Grab-UCB, an online sequential decision strategy that learns the parameters of the spectral representation while optimizing the action strategy. We derive the performance guarantees that depend on network parameters, which further influence the learning curve of the sequential decision strategy We introduce a computationally simplified solving method, Grab-arm-Light, an algorithm that walks along the edges of the polytope representing the objective function. Simulations results show that the proposed online learning algorithm outperforms baseline offline methods that typically separate the learning phase from the testing one. The results confirm the theoretical findings, and further highlight the gain of the proposed online learning strategy in terms of cumulative regret, sample efficiency and computational complexity. ",

Privacy categorization involves the possibility to classify users according to specific prerequisites, such as their ability to manage privacy issues, or in terms of which type of and how many personal information they decide or do not decide to disclose. Privacy categorization has been defined and used for different purposes. The systematic review focuses on three main research questions that investigate the study contexts, i.e. the motivations and research questions, that propose privacy categorisations; the methodologies and results of privacy categorisations; the evolution of privacy categorisations over time. Ultimately it tries to provide an answer whether privacy categorization as a research attempt is still meaningful and may have a future. ",

We focus on studies using matching for causal inference. We augment a classic matching analysis by incorporating text in three ways: by using text to supplement a multiple imputation procedure, we improve the fidelity of imputed values to handle missing data; by incorporating text in the matching stage, we strengthen the plausibility of the matching procedure; and by conditioning on text, we can estimate easily interpretable text-based heterogeneous treatment effects that may be stronger than those found across categories of structured covariates. Using these techniques, we hope to expand the scope of secondary analysis of clinical data to domains where quantitative data is of poor quality or nonexistent, but where text is available, such as in developing countries.

Membership inference can be formalized as a hypothesis testing problem. The most effective existing attacks estimate the distribution of some test statistic (usually the model's confidence on the true label) on points that were (and were not) used in training by training many \\emph{shadow models} -- i.e. models of the same architecture as the model being attacked, trained on a random subsample of data. While effective, these attacks are extremely computationally expensive, especially when the model under attack is large. We introduce a new class of attacks based on performing quantile regression on the distribution of confidence scores induced by the model under attack on points that are not used in training. We show that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art shadow model attacks, while requiring substantially less compute because our attack requires training only a single model. Moreover, unlike shadow model attacks, our proposed attack does not require any knowledge of the architecture of the model under attack and is therefore truly ``black-box\". We show the efficacy of this approach in an extensive series of experiments on various datasets and model architectures. ",

Detecting and labeling online illicit drug trafficking activities becomes important in addressing this issue. However, the effectiveness of conventional supervised learning methods in detecting drug trafficking heavily relies on having access to substantial amounts of labeled data, while data annotation is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Furthermore, these models often face challenges in accurately identifying trafficking activities when drug dealers use deceptive language and euphemisms to avoid detection. To overcome this limitation, we conduct the first systematic study on leveraging large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to detect illicit drug trafficking activities on social media. We propose an analytical framework to compose \\emph{knowledge-informed prompts}, which serve as the interface that humans can interact with and use LLMs to perform the detection task. Additionally, we design a Monte Carlo dropout based prompt optimization method to further to improve performance and interpretability. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms other baseline language models in terms of drug trafficking detection accuracy, showing a remarkable improvement of nearly 12\\%. By integrating prior knowledge and the proposed prompts, ChatGPT can effectively identify and label drug trafficking activities on social networks, even in the presence of deceptive language and euphemisms used by drug dealers to evade detection. The implications of our research extend to social networks, emphasizing the importance of incorporating prior knowledge and scenario-based prompts into analytical tools to improve online security and public safety.

An ideal neural network architecture for such tasks would leverage the fact that objects can be rotated and translated in three dimensions to make predictions about novel images. However, imposing SO(3)-equivariance on two-dimensional inputs is difficult because the group of three-dimensional rotations does not have a natural action on the two-dimensional plane. Specifically, it is possible that an element of SO(3) will rotate an image out of plane. We show that an algorithm that learns a three-dimensional representation of the world from two dimensional images must satisfy certain geometric consistency properties which we formulate as SO(2)-equivariance constraints. We use the induced and restricted representations of SO(2) on SO(3) to construct and classify architectures which satisfy these geometric consistency constraints. We prove that any architecture which respects said consistency constraints can be realized as an instance of our construction. We show that three previously proposed neural architectures for 3D pose prediction are special cases of our construction. We propose a new algorithm that is a learnable generalization of previously considered methods. We test our architecture on three pose predictions task and achieve SOTA results on both the PASCAL3D+ and SYMSOL pose estimation tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Learning effective continuous control policies in high-dimensional systems, including musculoskeletal agents, remains a significant challenge. Over the course of biological evolution, organisms have developed robust mechanisms for overcoming this complexity to learn highly sophisticated strategies for motor control. What accounts for this robust behavioral flexibility? Modular control via muscle synergies, i.e. coordinated muscle co-contractions, is considered to be one putative mechanism that enables organisms to learn muscle control in a simplified and generalizable action space. Drawing inspiration from this evolved motor control strategy, we use physiologically accurate human hand and leg models as a testbed for determining the extent to which a Synergistic Action Representation (SAR) acquired from simpler tasks facilitates learning more complex tasks. We find in both cases that SAR-exploiting policies significantly outperform end-to-end reinforcement learning. Policies trained with SAR were able to achieve robust locomotion on a wide set of terrains with high sample efficiency, while baseline approaches failed to learn meaningful behaviors. Additionally, policies trained with SAR on a multiobject manipulation task significantly outperformed (>70% success) baseline approaches (<20% success). Both of these SAR-exploiting policies were also found to generalize zero-shot to out-of-domain environmental conditions, while policies that did not adopt SAR failed to generalize. Finally, we establish the generality of SAR on broader high-dimensional control problems using a robotic manipulation task set and a full-body humanoid locomotion task. To the best of our knowledge, this investigation is the first of its kind to present an end-to-end pipeline for discovering synergies and using this representation to learn high-dimensional continuous control across a wide diversity of tasks.

This framework incorporates centroblast labels from pathologists and combines them with pseudo-negative labels obtained from undersampled false-positive predictions using the cell's morphological features. By employing PseudoCell, pathologists' workload can be reduced as it accurately narrows down the areas requiring their attention during examining tissue. Depending on the confidence threshold, PseudoCell can eliminate 58.18-99.35% of non-centroblasts tissue areas on WSI. This study presents a practical centroblast prescreening method that does not require pathologists' refined labels for improvement.

When the central limit theorem can be applied in the infinite-width (infinite-$N$) limit, the ensemble of networks corresponds to a free field theory. Although an expansion in $1/N$ corresponds to interactions in the field theory, others, such as in a small breaking of the statistical independence of network parameters, can also lead to interacting theories. These other expansions can be advantageous over the $1/N$-expansion, for example by improved behavior with respect to the universal approximation theorem. Given the connected correlators of a field theory, one can systematically reconstruct the action order-by-order in the expansion parameter, using a new Feynman diagram prescription whose vertices are the connected correlators. This method is motivated by the Edgeworth expansion and allows one to derive actions for neural network field theories. Conversely, the correspondence allows one to engineer architectures realizing a given field theory by representing action deformations as deformations of neural network parameter densities. As an example, $\\phi^4$ theory is realized as an infinite-$N$ neural network field theory. ",

In this study, we propose a dual inverse degradation SDRTV-to-HDRTV network DIDNet to address the issue of coding artifact restoration in converted HDRTV, which has not been previously studied. Specifically, we propose a temporal-spatial feature alignment module and dual modulation convolution to remove coding artifacts and enhance color restoration ability. Furthermore, a wavelet attention module is proposed to improve SDRTV features in the frequency domain. An auxiliary loss is introduced to decouple the learning process for effectively restoring from dual degradation.

    "title": "Merging-Diverging Hybrid Transformer Networks for Survival Prediction in  Head and Neck Cancer",
    "abstract": "Survival prediction is crucial for cancer patients as it provides early prognostic information for treatment planning. Recently, deep survival models based on deep learning and medical images have shown promising performance for survival prediction. However, existing deep survival models are not well developed in utilizing multi-modality images (e.g., PET-CT) and in extracting region-specific information (e.g., the prognostic information in Primary Tumor (PT) and Metastatic Lymph Node (MLN) regions). In view of this, we propose a merging-diverging learning framework for survival prediction from multi-modality images. This framework has a merging encoder to fuse multi-modality information and a diverging decoder to extract region-specific information. In the merging encoder, we propose a Hybrid Parallel Cross-Attention (HPCA) block to effectively fuse multi-modality features via parallel convolutional layers and cross-attention transformers. In the diverging decoder, we propose a Region-specific Attention Gate (RAG) block to screen out the features related to lesion regions. Our framework is demonstrated on survival prediction from PET-CT images in Head and Neck (H&N) cancer, by designing an X-shape merging-diverging hybrid transformer network (named XSurv). Our XSurv combines the complementary information in PET and CT images and extracts the region-specific prognostic information in PT and MLN regions. Extensive experiments on the public dataset of HEad and neCK TumOR segmentation and outcome prediction challenge (HECKTOR 2022) demonstrate that our XSurv outperforms state-of-the-art survival prediction methods.

    "title": "Learning Theory of Distribution Regression with Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we aim at establishing an approximation theory and a learning theory of distribution regression via a fully connected neural network (FNN). In contrast to the classical regression methods, the input variables of distribution regression are probability measures. Then we often need to perform a second-stage sampling process to approximate the actual information of the distribution. On the other hand, the classical neural network structure requires the input variable to be a vector. When the input samples are probability distributions, the traditional deep neural network method cannot be directly used and the difficulty arises for distribution regression. A well-defined neural network structure for distribution inputs is intensively desirable. There is no mathematical model and theoretical analysis on neural network realization of distribution regression. To overcome technical difficulties and address this issue, we establish a novel fully connected neural network framework to realize an approximation theory of functionals defined on the space of Borel probability measures. Furthermore, based on the established functional approximation results, in the hypothesis space induced by the novel FNN structure with distribution inputs, almost optimal learning rates for the proposed distribution regression model up to logarithmic terms are derived via a novel two-stage error decomposition technique.

    "title": "Modeling critical connectivity constraints in random and empirical  networks",
    "abstract": "Random networks are a powerful tool in the analytical modeling of complex networks as they allow us to write approximate mathematical models for diverse properties and behaviors of networks. One notable shortcoming of these models is that they are often used to study processes in terms of how they affect the giant connected component of the network, yet they fail to properly account for that component. As an example, this approach is often used to answer questions such as how robust is the network to random damage but fails to capture the structure of the network before any inflicted damage. Here, we introduce a simple conceptual step to account for such connectivity constraints in existing models. We distinguish network neighbors into two types of connections that can lead or not to a component of interest, which we call critical and subcritical degrees. In doing so, we capture important structural features of the network in a system of only one or two equations. In particular cases where the component of interest is surprising under classic random network models, such as sparse connected networks, a single equation can approximate state-of-the art models like message passing which require a number of equations linear in system size. We discuss potential applications of this simple framework for the study of infrastructure networks where connectivity constraints are critical to the function of the system. ",
