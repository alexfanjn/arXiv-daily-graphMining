    "abstract": "In this article, a novel time-coordination algorithm based on event-triggered communications is proposed to achieve coordinated path-following of UAVs. To be specific, in the approach adopted a UAV transmits its progression information over a time-varying network to its neighbors only when a decentralized trigger condition is satisfied, thereby significantly reducing the volume of inter-vehicle communications required when compared with the existing algorithms based on continuous communications. Using such intermittent communications, it is shown that a decentralized coordination controller guarantees exponential convergence of the coordination error to a neighborhood of zero. Also, a lower bound on the interval between two consecutive event-triggered times is provided showing that the chattering issue does not arise with the proposed algorithm. Finally, simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Industry 4.0 involves the integration of digital technologies, such as IoT, Big Data, and AI, into manufacturing and industrial processes to increase efficiency and productivity. As these technologies become more interconnected and interdependent, Industry 4.0 systems become more complex, which brings the difficulty of identifying and stopping anomalies that may cause disturbances in the manufacturing process. This paper aims to propose a diffusion-based model for real-time anomaly prediction in Industry 4.0 processes. Using a neuro-symbolic approach, we integrate industrial ontologies in the model, thereby adding formal knowledge on smart manufacturing. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective way of distilling diffusion models through Random Fourier Features for deployment on an embedded system for direct integration into the manufacturing process. To the best of our knowledge, this approach has never been explored before. ",

Next, in discrete rounds, the disease spreads in the network from infected to healthy individuals such that a healthy individual gets infected if and only if a sufficient number of its direct neighbours are already infected. We represent the social network as a graph. Inspired by the real-world restrictions in the current epidemic, especially by social and physical distancing requirements, we restrict ourselves to networks that can be represented as geometric intersection graphs. We show that finding a minimal vertex set of initially infected individuals to spread the disease in the whole network is computationally hard, already on unit disk graphs.

    "abstract": "With the rise of social media and online news sources, fake news has become a significant issue globally. However, the detection of fake news in low resource languages like Bengali has received limited attention in research. In this paper, we propose a methodology consisting of four distinct approaches to classify fake news articles in Bengali using summarization and augmentation techniques with five pre-trained language models. Our approach includes translating English news articles and using augmentation techniques to curb the deficit of fake news articles. Our research also focused on summarizing the news to tackle the token length limitation of BERT based models. Through extensive experimentation and rigorous evaluation, we show the effectiveness of summarization and augmentation in the case of Bengali fake news detection. We evaluated our models using three separate test datasets. The BanglaBERT Base model, when combined with augmentation techniques, achieved an impressive accuracy of 96% on the first test dataset. On the second test dataset, the BanglaBERT model, trained with summarized augmented news articles achieved 97% accuracy. Lastly, the mBERT Base model achieved an accuracy of 86% on the third test dataset which was reserved for generalization performance evaluation.

Online extremists have been involved in the spread of online hate, mis/disinformation, and real-world violence. However, the overwhelming majority of existing work has focused on right-wing extremism. In this paper, we perform a first of its kind large-scale, data-driven study exploring left-wing extremism. We focus on \"tankies,\" a left-wing community that first arose in the 1950s in support of hardline actions of the USSR and has evolved to support what they call \"actually existing socialist countries,\" e.g., CCP run China, the USSR, former soviet countries, and North Korea. We collect 1.3M posts from 53K authors from tankies subreddits, and explore the position of tankies within the broader far-left community on Reddit. Among other things, we find that tankies are clearly on the periphery of the larger far-left community. When examining the contents of posts, we find misalignments and conceptual homomorphisms that confirm the description of tankies in the theoretical work. We also discover that tankies focus more on state-level political events rather than social issues in comparison to other far-left communities. Finally, we show that tankies exhibit some of the same worrying behaviors as right-wing extremists, e.g., relatively high toxicity and an organized response to deplatforming events. ",

We consider a dataset of non-linear polynomial problems and the problem of selecting a variable ordering for cylindrical algebraic decomposition to tackle these with. By swapping the variable names in already labelled problems, we generate new problem instances that do not require any further labelling when viewing the selection as a classification problem. We find this augmentation increases the accuracy of ML models by 63% on average. We study what part of this improvement is due to the balancing of the dataset and what is achieved thanks to further increasing the size of the dataset, concluding that both have a very significant effect. We finish the paper by reflecting on how this idea could be applied in other uses of machine learning in mathematics. ",

Specifically, we evaluated eight OOD detection methods that are easily integrable into existing NLP systems and require no additional OOD data or model modifications. One of our contributions is providing a well-structured research environment that allows for full reproducibility of the results. Additionally, our analysis shows that existing OOD detection methods for NLP tasks are not yet sufficiently sensitive to capture all samples characterized by various types of distributional shifts. Particularly challenging testing scenarios arise in cases of background shift and randomly shuffled word order within in domain texts. This highlights the need for future work to develop more effective OOD detection approaches for the NLP problems, and our work provides a well-defined foundation for further research in this area. ",

Along with its benefits, network slicing is introducing new challenges in the development of sustainable network operations. In fact, guaranteeing slices requirements comes at the cost of additional energy consumption, in comparison to non-sliced networks. Yet, one of the main goals of operators is to offer the diverse 5G and beyond services, while ensuring energy efficiency. To this end, we study the problem of slice activation/deactivation, with the objective of minimizing energy consumption and maximizing the users quality of service (QoS). To solve the problem, we rely on two Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) agents to derive decisions at individual base stations. Our evaluations are conducted using a real-world traffic dataset collected over an operational network in a medium size French city. Numerical results reveal that our proposed solutions provide approximately 11-14\\% energy efficiency improvement compared to a configuration where all the slice instances are active, while maintaining the same level of QoS. Moreover, our work explicitly shows the impact of prioritizing the energy over QoS, and vice versa. ",

In this work, we treat different modalities as distinct styles and propose a framework to adapt feature maps, bridging the domain gap. We introduce a novel Conditional Adaptive Instance Modulation (CAIM) module that can be integrated into pre-trained FR networks, transforming them into HFR networks. The CAIM block modulates intermediate feature maps, to adapt the style of the target modality effectively bridging the domain gap. Our proposed method allows for end-to-end training with a minimal number of paired samples.

Such systematic errors arise from the choice of Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function for network training, which is incompatible with Rician-distributed MR magnitude signals. To address this issue, we introduce the negative log Rician likelihood (NLR) loss. Methods: A numerically stable and accurate implementation of the NLR loss was developed to estimate quantitative parameters of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) model and intra-voxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model. Parameter estimation accuracy, precision and overall error were evaluated in terms of bias, variance and root mean squared error and compared against the MSE loss over a range of SNRs (5 - 30). Results: Networks trained with NLR loss show higher estimation accuracy than MSE for the ADC and IVIM diffusion coefficients as SNR decreases, with minimal loss of precision or total error. At high effective SNR (high SNR and small diffusion coefficients), both losses show comparable accuracy and precision for all parameters of both models. Conclusion: The proposed NLR loss is numerically stable and accurate across the full range of tested SNRs and improves parameter estimation accuracy of diffusion coefficients using self-supervised deep learning. We expect the development to benefit quantitative MR imaging techniques broadly, enabling more accurate parameter estimation from noisy data. ",

By exploiting the innate \\emph{agility} and \\emph{mobility} of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we conceive a mobile relaying-assisted drone swarm network architecture, which is capable of extending the coverage of the ground station and enhancing the effective end-to-end throughput. Explicitly, a swarm of drones forms a data-collecting drone swarm (DCDS) designed for sensing and collecting data with the aid of their mounted cameras and/or sensors, and a powerful relay-UAV (RUAV) acts as a mobile relay for conveying data between the DCDS and a ground station (GS). Given a time period, in order to maximize the data delivered whilst minimizing the delay imposed, we harness an $\\epsilon$-multiple objective genetic algorithm ($\\epsilon$-MOGA) assisted Pareto-optimization scheme. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mobile relaying is capable of delivering more data. As specific examples investigated in our simulations, our mobile relaying-assisted drone swarm network is capable of delivering $45.38\\%$ more data than the benchmark solutions, when a stationary relay is available, and it is capable of delivering $26.86\\%$ more data than the benchmark solutions when no stationary relay is available.

While demonstrating superior performance in the task of synthesizing novel views, the majority of these methods are still based on the conventional multi-layer perceptron for scene embedding. Furthermore, light field models suffer from geometric blurring during pixel rendering, while radiance field-based volume rendering methods have multiple solutions for a certain target of density distribution integration. To address these issues, we introduce the Convolutional Neural Radiance Fields to model the derivatives of radiance along rays. Based on 1D convolutional operations, our proposed method effectively extracts potential ray representations through a structured neural network architecture. Besides, with the proposed ray modeling, a proposed recurrent module is employed to solve geometric ambiguity in the fully neural rendering process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the promising results of our proposed model compared with existing state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel approach to addressing the output synchronization problem in unknown heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) using noisy data. Unlike existing studies that focus on noiseless data, we introduce a distributed data-driven controller that enables all heterogeneous followers to synchronize with a leader's trajectory. To handle the noise in the state-input-output data, we develop a data-based polytopic representation for the MAS. We tackle the issue of infeasibility in the set of output regulator equations caused by the noise by seeking approximate solutions via constrained fitting error minimization. This method utilizes measured data and a noise-matrix polytope to ensure near-optimal output synchronization. Stability conditions in the form of data-dependent semidefinite programs are derived, providing stabilizing controller gains for each follower. The proposed distributed data-driven control protocol achieves near-optimal output synchronization by ensuring the convergence of the tracking error to a bounded polytope, with the polytope size positively correlated with the noise bound. Numerical tests validate the practical merits of the proposed data-driven design and theory. ",

To solve the aforementioned issues, we introduce MMSD2.0, a correction dataset that fixes the shortcomings of MMSD, by removing the spurious cues and re-annotating the unreasonable samples.

    "abstract": "Brain-inspired spiking neuron networks (SNNs) have attracted widespread research interest due to their low power features, high biological plausibility, and strong spatiotemporal information processing capability. Although adopting a surrogate gradient (SG) makes the non-differentiability SNN trainable, achieving comparable accuracy for ANNs and keeping low-power features simultaneously is still tricky. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient spike-train level spiking neural network (SLSSNN) with low computational cost and high accuracy. In the SLSSNN, spatio-temporal conversion blocks (STCBs) are applied to replace the convolutional and ReLU layers to keep the low power features of SNNs and improve accuracy. However, SLSSNN cannot adopt backpropagation algorithms directly due to the non-differentiability nature of spike trains. We proposed a suitable learning rule for SLSSNNs by deducing the equivalent gradient of STCB. We evaluate the proposed SLSSNN on static and neuromorphic datasets, including Fashion-Mnist, Cifar10, Cifar100, TinyImageNet, and DVS-Cifar10. The experiment results show that our proposed SLSSNN outperforms the state-of-the-art accuracy on nearly all datasets, using fewer time steps and being highly energy-efficient. ",

Federated learning (FL), as a collaborative learning framework where the model training is distributed to cooperative data owners without the need for data sharing, can be leveraged to simultaneously improve learning efficiency and achieve privacy protection for AIGC. To this end, we present FL-based techniques for empowering AIGC, and aim to enable users to generate diverse, personalized, and high-quality content. Furthermore, we conduct a case study of FL-aided AIGC fine-tuning by using the state-of-the-art AIGC model, i.e., stable diffusion model. Numerical results show that our scheme achieves advantages in effectively reducing the communication cost and training latency and privacy protection.

The approach represents the interface implicitly by a signed distance function following the typical level set method and some embedding methods. Instead of solving the equation explicitly on the surface, we introduce a modified partial differential equation in a small neighborhood of the interface. This embedding equation is developed based on a push-forward operator that can extend any tangential flux vectors from the surface to a neighboring level surface. This operator is easy to compute and involves only the level set function and the corresponding Hessian. The resulting solution is constant in the normal direction of the interface. To demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of our method, we provide some two- and three-dimensional examples. ",

AT involves obtaining robustness by including adversarial examples in training a classifier. Most variants of AT algorithms treat every training example equally. However, recent works have shown that better performance is achievable by treating them unequally. In addition, it has been observed that AT exerts an uneven influence on different classes in a training set and unfairly hurts examples corresponding to classes that are inherently harder to classify. Consequently, various reweighting schemes have been proposed that assign unequal weights to robust losses of individual examples in a training set. In this work, we propose a novel instance-wise reweighting scheme. It considers the vulnerability of each natural example and the resulting information loss on its adversarial counterpart occasioned by adversarial attacks. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed method significantly improves over existing reweighting schemes, especially against strong white and black-box attacks. ",

    "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in vast real-world applications, their vulnerabilities towards noisy inputs have significantly limited their uses, especially in high-stake environments. In these contexts, it is crucial to ensure that every prediction made by large language models is stable, i.e., LLM predictions should be consistent given minor differences in the input. This largely falls into the study of certified robust LLMs, i.e., all predictions of LLM are certified to be correct in a local region around the input. Randomized smoothing has demonstrated great potential in certifying the robustness and prediction stability of LLMs. However, randomized smoothing requires adding noise to the input before model prediction, and its certification performance depends largely on the model's performance on corrupted data. As a result, its direct application to LLMs remains challenging and often results in a small certification radius. To address this issue, we take advantage of the multitasking nature of LLMs and propose to denoise the corrupted inputs with LLMs in a self-denoising manner. Different from previous works like denoised smoothing, which requires training a separate model to robustify LLM, our method enjoys far better efficiency and flexibility. Our experiment results show that our method outperforms the existing certification methods under both certified robustness and empirical robustness.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework, termed Erasing, Transforming, and Noising Defense Network (ETNDNet), which treats occlusion as a noise disturbance and solves occluded person re-ID from the perspective of adversarial defense. In the proposed ETNDNet, we introduce three strategies: Firstly, we randomly erase the feature map to create an adversarial representation with incomplete information, enabling adversarial learning of identity loss to protect the re-ID system from the disturbance of missing information. Secondly, we introduce random transformations to simulate the position misalignment caused by occlusion, training the extractor and classifier adversarially to learn robust representations immune to misaligned information. Thirdly, we perturb the feature map with random values to address noisy information introduced by obstacles and non-target pedestrians, and employ adversarial gaming in the re-ID system to enhance its resistance to occlusion noise. Without bells and whistles, ETNDNet has three key highlights: (i) it does not require any external modules with parameters, (ii) it effectively handles various issues caused by occlusion from obstacles and non-target pedestrians, and (iii) it designs the first GAN-based adversarial defense paradigm for occluded person re-ID. Extensive experiments on five public datasets fully demonstrate the effectiveness, superiority, and practicality of the proposed ETNDNet.

To this end, generations of researchers have pursued to develop robust methods for training DL architectures that can be less sensitive to weight distributions, model architectures and loss landscapes. However, such methods are limited to adaptive learning rate optimizers, initialization schemes, and clipping gradients without investigating the fundamental rule of parameters update. Although multiplicative updates have contributed significantly to the early development of machine learning and hold strong theoretical claims, to best of our knowledge, this is the first work that investigate them in context of DL training acceleration and robustness. In this work, we propose an optimization framework that fits to a wide range of optimization algorithms and enables one to apply alternative update rules. To this end, we propose a novel multiplicative update rule and we extend their capabilities by combining it with a traditional additive update term, under a novel hybrid update method. We claim that the proposed framework accelerates training, while leading to more robust models in contrast to traditionally used additive update rule and we experimentally demonstrate their effectiveness in a wide range of task and optimization methods. Such tasks ranging from convex and non-convex optimization to difficult image classification benchmarks applying a wide range of traditionally used optimization methods and Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures.

In a next step, we compare those results based on different amounts of training data to an alternative setup, where next-generation reservoir computing is used instead. It turns out that while delivering comparable performance for usual amounts of training data, next-generation RC significantly outperforms in situations where only very limited data is available.

We propose a novel generative model for video anomaly detection (VAD), which assumes that both normality and abnormality are multimodal. We consider skeletal representations and leverage state-of-the-art diffusion probabilistic models to generate multimodal future human poses. We contribute a novel conditioning on the past motion of people, and exploit the improved mode coverage capabilities of diffusion processes to generate different-but-plausible future motions. Upon the statistical aggregation of future modes, anomaly is detected when the generated set of motions is not pertinent to the actual future.

Most of the existing works in literature focus on learning more discriminative features from the input images, however, they are usually insensitive to the high- or low-frequency components in features, resulting in a decreasing performance on fine-grained image recognition. To address this problem, we propose a Complementary Frequency-varying Awareness Network that could better capture both high-frequency and low-frequency information, called CFAN. The proposed CFAN consists of three sequential modules: (i) a feature extraction module is introduced for learning preliminary features from the input images; (ii) a frequency-varying filtering module is designed to separate out both high- and low-frequency components from the preliminary features in the frequency domain via a frequency-adjustable filter; (iii) a complementary temporal aggregation module is designed for aggregating the high- and low-frequency components via two Long Short-Term Memory networks into discriminative features. Based on CFAN, we further propose an open-set fine-grained image recognition method, called CFAN-OSFGR, which learns image features via CFAN and classifies them via a linear classifier. Experimental results on 3 fine-grained datasets and 2 coarse-grained datasets demonstrate that CFAN-OSFGR performs significantly better than 9 state-of-the-art methods in most cases. ",

However, manually annotating curvilinear objects is very time-consuming and error-prone, yielding insufficiently available annotated datasets for existing supervised methods and domain adaptation methods. This paper proposes a self-supervised curvilinear object segmentation method that learns robust and distinctive features from fractals and unlabeled images (FreeCOS). The key contributions include a novel Fractal-FDA synthesis (FFS) module and a geometric information alignment (GIA) approach. FFS generates curvilinear structures based on the parametric Fractal L-system and integrates the generated structures into unlabeled images to obtain synthetic training images via Fourier Domain Adaptation. GIA reduces the intensity differences between the synthetic and unlabeled images by comparing the intensity order of a given pixel to the values of its nearby neighbors. Such image alignment can explicitly remove the dependency on absolute intensity values and enhance the inherent geometric characteristics which are common in both synthetic and real images. In addition, GIA aligns features of synthetic and real images via the prediction space adaptation loss (PSAL) and the curvilinear mask contrastive loss (CMCL). Extensive experimental results on four public datasets, i.e., XCAD, DRIVE, STARE and CrackTree demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, self-supervised methods and traditional methods by a large margin.

To prevent potential threats, various adversarial training-based defense methods have grown rapidly and become a de facto standard approach for robustness. Despite recent competitive achievements, we observe that adversarial vulnerability varies across targets and certain vulnerabilities remain prevalent. Intriguingly, such peculiar phenomenon cannot be relieved even with deeper architectures and advanced defense methods. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce a causal approach called Adversarial Double Machine Learning (ADML), which allows us to quantify the degree of adversarial vulnerability for network predictions and capture the effect of treatments on outcome of interests. ADML can directly estimate causal parameter of adversarial perturbations per se and mitigate negative effects that can potentially damage robustness, bridging a causal perspective into the adversarial vulnerability. Through extensive experiments on various CNN and Transformer architectures, we corroborate that ADML improves adversarial robustness with large margins and relieve the empirical observation. ",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based pre-trained language models, such as BERT, achieve great success in various natural language understanding tasks. Prior research found that BERT captures a rich hierarchy of linguistic information at different layers. However, the vanilla BERT uses the same self-attention mechanism for each layer to model the different contextual features. In this paper, we propose a HybridBERT model which combines self-attention and pooling networks to encode different contextual features in each layer. Additionally, we propose a simple DropMask method to address the mismatch between pre-training and fine-tuning caused by excessive use of special mask tokens during Masked Language Modeling pre-training. Experiments show that HybridBERT outperforms BERT in pre-training with lower loss, faster training speed (8% relative), lower memory cost (13% relative), and also in transfer learning with 1.5% relative higher accuracies on downstream tasks. Additionally, DropMask improves accuracies of BERT on downstream tasks across various masking rates. ",

A GPT-style causal language model trained on this tokenizer (called MorphGPT) shows superior convergence compared to the same architecture trained on a standard BPE tokenizer.

The problem whether a given spanning tree can be a graph search tree has been considered for different searches, graph classes and search tree paradigms. Similarly, the question whether a particular vertex can be visited last by some search has been studied extensively in recent years. We combine these two problems by considering the question whether a vertex can be a leaf of a graph search tree. We show that for particular search trees, including DFS trees, this problem is easy if we allow the leaf to be the first vertex of the search ordering. We contrast this result by showing that the problem becomes hard for many searches, including DFS and BFS, if we forbid the leaf to be the first vertex.

    "abstract": "Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Fusion (MHIF) is a practical task that aims to fuse a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI) and a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) of the same scene to obtain a high-resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI). Benefiting from powerful inductive bias capability, CNN-based methods have achieved great success in the MHIF task. However, they lack certain interpretability and require convolution structures be stacked to enhance performance. Recently, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has achieved good performance and interpretability in 2D tasks due to its ability to locally interpolate samples and utilize multimodal content such as pixels and coordinates. Although INR-based approaches show promise, they require extra construction of high-frequency information (\\emph{e.g.,} positional encoding). In this paper, inspired by previous work of MHIF task, we realize that HR-MSI could serve as a high-frequency detail auxiliary input, leading us to propose a novel INR-based hyperspectral fusion function named Implicit Neural Feature Fusion Function (INF). As an elaborate structure, it solves the MHIF task and addresses deficiencies in the INR-based approaches. Specifically, our INF designs a Dual High-Frequency Fusion (DHFF) structure that obtains high-frequency information twice from HR-MSI and LR-HSI, then subtly fuses them with coordinate information. Moreover, the proposed INF incorporates a parameter-free method named INR with cosine similarity (INR-CS) that uses cosine similarity to generate local weights through feature vectors. Based on INF, we construct an Implicit Neural Fusion Network (INFN) that achieves state-of-the-art performance for MHIF tasks of two public datasets, \\emph{i.e.,} CAVE and Harvard. The code will soon be made available on GitHub. ",

Such limitations hinder the real-time imaging and practical deployment of models. In this work, we propose a Sampling-Priors-Augmented Deep Unfolding Network (SPA-DUN) for efficient and robust VCS reconstruction. Under the optimization-inspired deep unfolding framework, a lightweight and efficient U-net is exploited to downsize the model while improving overall performance. Moreover, the prior knowledge from the sampling model is utilized to dynamically modulate the network features to enable single SPA-DUN to handle arbitrary sampling settings, augmenting interpretability and generality. Extensive experiments on both simulation and real datasets demonstrate that SPA-DUN is not only applicable for various sampling settings with one single model but also achieves SOTA performance with incredible efficiency.

For computing high resolution approximations of the solution to the nonlinear wave model, we propose higher order space-time finite element methods in combination with collocation techniques. Thereby, $C^{l}$-regularity in time of the global discrete is ensured. The resulting simulation data is used to train solution operators that effectively leverage the higher regularity of the training data. The solution operator is represented by Fourier Neural Operators and Gated Recurrent Units and can be used as the forward solver in the optimal Dirichlet boundary control problem. The proposed algorithm is implemented and tested on modern high-performance computing platforms, with a focus on efficiency and scalability. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on the problem of generating Terahertz radiation in periodically poled Lithium Niobate, where the neural network is used as the solver in the optimal control setting to optimize the parametrization of the optical input pulse and maximize the yield of $0.3\\,$THz-frequency radiation. We exploit the periodic layering of the crystal to design the neural networks. The networks are trained to learn the propagation through one period of the layers. The recursive application of the network onto itself yields an approximation to the full problem. Our results indicate that the proposed method can achieve a significant speedup in computation time compared to classical methods. A comparison of our results to experimental data shows the potential to revolutionize the way we approach optimization problems in nonlinear optics. ",

    "abstract": "Data-poisoning based backdoor attacks aim to insert backdoor into models by manipulating training datasets without controlling the training process of the target model. Existing attack methods mainly focus on designing triggers or fusion strategies between triggers and benign samples. However, they often randomly select samples to be poisoned, disregarding the varying importance of each poisoning sample in terms of backdoor injection. A recent selection strategy filters a fixed-size poisoning sample pool by recording forgetting events, but it fails to consider the remaining samples outside the pool from a global perspective. Moreover, computing forgetting events requires significant additional computing resources. Therefore, how to efficiently and effectively select poisoning samples from the entire dataset is an urgent problem in backdoor attacks.To address it, firstly, we introduce a poisoning mask into the regular backdoor training loss. We suppose that a backdoored model training with hard poisoning samples has a more backdoor effect on easy ones, which can be implemented by hindering the normal training process (\\ie, maximizing loss \\wrt mask). To further integrate it with normal training process, we then propose a learnable poisoning sample selection strategy to learn the mask together with the model parameters through a min-max optimization.Specifically, the outer loop aims to achieve the backdoor attack goal by minimizing the loss based on the selected samples, while the inner loop selects hard poisoning samples that impede this goal by maximizing the loss. After several rounds of adversarial training, we finally select effective poisoning samples with high contribution. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in boosting backdoor attack performance. ",

    "abstract": "The missing signal caused by the objects being occluded or an unstable sensor is a common challenge during data collection. Such missing signals will adversely affect the results obtained from the data, and this issue is observed more frequently in robotic tactile perception. In tactile perception, due to the limited working space and the dynamic environment, the contact between the tactile sensor and the object is frequently insufficient and unstable, which causes the partial loss of signals, thus leading to incomplete tactile data. The tactile data will therefore contain fewer tactile cues with low information density. In this paper, we propose a tactile representation learning method, named TacMAE, based on Masked Autoencoder to address the problem of incomplete tactile data in tactile perception. In our framework, a portion of the tactile image is masked out to simulate the missing contact region. By reconstructing the missing signals in the tactile image, the trained model can achieve a high-level understanding of surface geometry and tactile properties from limited tactile cues. The experimental results of tactile texture recognition show that our proposed TacMAE can achieve a high recognition accuracy of 71.4% in the zero-shot transfer and 85.8% after fine-tuning, which are 15.2% and 8.2% higher than the results without using masked modeling.

Existing methods focus on pruning parameters in the training process by using thresholds and metrics. Meanwhile, feature similarity between different layers has not been discussed sufficiently before, which could be rigorously proved to be highly correlated to the network sparsity in this paper. Inspired by interlayer feature similarity in overparameterized models, we investigate the intrinsic link between network sparsity and interlayer feature similarity. Specifically, we prove that reducing interlayer feature similarity based on Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) improves the sparsity of the network by using information bottleneck theory. Applying such theory, we propose a plug-and-play CKA-based Sparsity Regularization for sparse network training, dubbed CKA-SR, which utilizes CKA to reduce feature similarity between layers and increase network sparsity. In other words, layers of our sparse network tend to have their own identity compared to each other. Experimentally, we plug the proposed CKA-SR into the training process of sparse network training methods and find that CKA-SR consistently improves the performance of several State-Of-The-Art sparse training methods, especially at extremely high sparsity.

In this work we provide sharp results for the implicit regularization imposed by the gradient flow of Diagonal Linear Networks (DLNs) in the over-parameterized regression setting and, potentially surprisingly, link this to the phenomenon of phase transitions in generalized hardness of approximation (GHA). GHA generalizes the phenomenon of hardness of approximation from computer science to, among others, continuous and robust optimization. It is well-known that the $\\ell^1$-norm of the gradient flow of DLNs with tiny initialization converges to the objective function of basis pursuit. We improve upon these results by showing that the gradient flow of DLNs with tiny initialization approximates minimizers of the basis pursuit optimization problem (as opposed to just the objective function), and we obtain new and sharp convergence bounds w.r.t.\\ the initialization size. Non-sharpness of our results would imply that the GHA phenomenon would not occur for the basis pursuit optimization problem -- which is a contradiction -- thus implying sharpness.

To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{Ro}bust \\textbf{P}rompt-based \\textbf{D}ata \\textbf{A}ugmentation (RoPDA) for low-resource NER. Based on pre-trained language models (PLMs) with continuous prompt, RoPDA performs entity augmentation and context augmentation through five fundamental augmentation operations to generate label-flipping and label-preserving examples. To optimize the utilization of the augmented samples, we present two techniques: Self-Consistency Filtering and mixup. The former effectively eliminates low-quality samples, while the latter prevents performance degradation arising from the direct utilization of label-flipping samples. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks from different domains demonstrate that RoPDA significantly improves upon strong baselines, and also outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning methods when unlabeled data is included.

We develop RT-MIR techniques aimed at augmenting percussive fingerstyle, which blends acoustic guitar playing with guitar body percussion. We formulate several design objectives for RT-MIR systems for augmented instrument performance: (i) causal constraint, (ii) perceptually negligible action-to-sound latency, (iii) control intimacy support, (iv) synthesis control support. We present and evaluate real-time guitar body percussion recognition and embedding learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and CNNs jointly trained with variational autoencoders (VAEs). We introduce a taxonomy of guitar body percussion based on hand part and location. We follow a cross-dataset evaluation approach by collecting three datasets labelled according to the taxonomy. The embedding quality of the models is assessed using KL-Divergence across distributions corresponding to different taxonomic classes. Results indicate that the networks are strong classifiers especially in a simplified 2-class recognition task, and the VAEs yield improved class separation compared to CNNs as evidenced by increased KL-Divergence across distributions. We argue that the VAE embedding quality could support control intimacy and rich interaction when the latent space's parameters are used to control an external synthesis engine. Further design challenges around generalisation to different datasets have been identified. ",

This study evaluates the use of time series Sentinel-1 VH/VV for LAI imputation, aiming to increase spatial-temporal density. We utilize a bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network to impute time series LAI and use half mean squared error for each time step as the loss function. We trained models on data from southern Germany and the North China Plain using only LAI data generated by Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2. Experimental results show BiLSTM outperforms traditional regression methods, capturing nonlinear dynamics between multiple time series. It proves robust in various growing conditions and is effective even with limited Sentinel-2 images. BiLSTM's performance surpasses that of LSTM, particularly over the senescence period. Therefore, BiLSTM can be used to impute LAI with time-series Sentinel-1 VH/VV and Sentinel-2 data, and this method could be applied to other time-series imputation issues. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the integration of Machine Learning (ML) models with Operation Research (OR) tools has gained popularity across diverse applications, including cancer treatment, algorithmic configuration, and chemical process optimization. In this domain, the combination of ML and OR often relies on representing the ML model output using Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulations. Numerous studies in the literature have developed such formulations for many ML predictors, with a particular emphasis on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their significant interest in many applications. However, ANNs frequently contain a large number of parameters, resulting in MIP formulations that are impractical to solve, thereby impeding scalability. In fact, the ML community has already introduced several techniques to reduce the parameter count of ANNs without compromising their performance, since the substantial size of modern ANNs presents challenges for ML applications as it significantly impacts computational efforts during training and necessitates significant memory resources for storage. In this paper, we showcase the effectiveness of pruning, one of these techniques, when applied to ANNs prior to their integration into MIPs. By pruning the ANN, we achieve significant improvements in the speed of the solution process. We discuss why pruning is more suitable in this context compared to other ML compression techniques, and we identify the most appropriate pruning strategies. To highlight the potential of this approach, we conduct experiments using feed-forward neural networks with multiple layers to construct adversarial examples. Our results demonstrate that pruning offers remarkable reductions in solution times without hindering the quality of the final decision, enabling the resolution of previously unsolvable instances. ",

Previous methods use late fusion and co-attention mechanism to capture interactive relations, which have limited learning capability or inefficiency to adapt to more interacting entities. With assumption that priors of each entity are already known, they also lack evaluations on a more general setting addressing the diversity of subjects. To address these problems, we propose an Interactive Spatiotemporal Token Attention Network (ISTA-Net), which simultaneously model spatial, temporal, and interactive relations. Specifically, our network contains a tokenizer to partition Interactive Spatiotemporal Tokens (ISTs), which is a unified way to represent motions of multiple diverse entities. By extending the entity dimension, ISTs provide better interactive representations. To jointly learn along three dimensions in ISTs, multi-head self-attention blocks integrated with 3D convolutions are designed to capture inter-token correlations. When modeling correlations, a strict entity ordering is usually irrelevant for recognizing interactive actions. To this end, Entity Rearrangement is proposed to eliminate the orderliness in ISTs for interchangeable entities. Extensive experiments on four datasets verify the effectiveness of ISTA-Net by outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Necolizer/ISTA-Net ",

This paper introduces a simple yet effective strategy named Thumbnail Layout (TALL), which transforms a video clip into a pre-defined layout to realize the preservation of spatial and temporal dependencies. Specifically, consecutive frames are masked in a fixed position in each frame to improve generalization, then resized to sub-images and rearranged into a pre-defined layout as the thumbnail. TALL is model-agnostic and extremely simple by only modifying a few lines of code. Inspired by the success of vision transformers, we incorporate TALL into Swin Transformer, forming an efficient and effective method TALL-Swin. Extensive experiments on intra-dataset and cross-dataset validate the validity and superiority of TALL and SOTA TALL-Swin.

To support interactions with scarcely available data, we propose an automated synthetic data pipeline. For this, we seed a pre-trained motion model, which has priors for the basics of human movement, with interaction-specific anchor poses extracted from limited motion capture data. Using our guided diffusion model trained on generated synthetic data, we synthesize realistic motions for sitting and lifting with several objects, outperforming alternative approaches in terms of motion quality and successful action completion.

This is especially important for interpretability and fairness considerations. In a broader context, scenarios in which monotonicity is important can be found in finance, medicine, physics, and other disciplines. It is thus desirable to build neural network architectures that implement this inductive bias provably. In this work, we propose a weight-constrained architecture with a single residual connection to achieve exact monotonic dependence in any subset of the inputs. The weight constraint scheme directly controls the Lipschitz constant of the neural network and thus provides the additional benefit of robustness. Compared to currently existing techniques used for monotonicity, our method is simpler in implementation and in theory foundations, has negligible computational overhead, is guaranteed to produce monotonic dependence, and is highly expressive. We show how the algorithm is used to train powerful, robust, and interpretable discriminators that achieve competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks, from social applications to the classification of the decays of subatomic particles produced at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a prime example, being underdiagnosed despite being the third leading cause of death. Its sparse, diffuse and heterogeneous appearance on computed tomography challenges supervised binary classification. We reformulate COPD binary classification as an anomaly detection task, proposing cOOpD: heterogeneous pathological regions are detected as Out-of-Distribution (OOD) from normal homogeneous lung regions. To this end, we learn representations of unlabeled lung regions employing a self-supervised contrastive pretext model, potentially capturing specific characteristics of diseased and healthy unlabeled regions. A generative model then learns the distribution of healthy representations and identifies abnormalities (stemming from COPD) as deviations. Patient-level scores are obtained by aggregating region OOD scores. We show that cOOpD achieves the best performance on two public datasets, with an increase of 8.2% and 7.7% in terms of AUROC compared to the previous supervised state-of-the-art. Additionally, cOOpD yields well-interpretable spatial anomaly maps and patient-level scores which we show to be of additional value in identifying individuals in the early stage of progression. Experiments in artificially designed real-world prevalence settings further support that anomaly detection is a powerful way of tackling COPD classification. ",

In this paper, we describe an approach to self-supervised representation learning from raw audio using a hidden unit clustering (HUC) framework. The input to the model consists of audio samples that are windowed and processed with 1-D convolutional layers. The learned \"time-frequency\" representations from the convolutional neural network (CNN) module are further processed with long short term memory (LSTM) layers which generate a contextual vector representation for every windowed segment. The HUC framework, allowing the categorization of the representations into a small number of phoneme-like units, is used to train the model for learning semantically rich speech representations. The targets consist of phoneme-like pseudo labels for each audio segment and these are generated with an iterative k-means algorithm. We explore techniques that improve the speaker invariance of the learned representations and illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on two settings, i) completely unsupervised speech applications on the sub-tasks described as part of the ZeroSpeech 2021 challenge and ii) semi-supervised automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications on the TIMIT dataset and on the GramVaani challenge Hindi dataset.

We demonstrate the proposed approach by applying it to an illustrative problem within the realm of near-field radiative heat transfer involving a multilayered hyperbolic metamaterial. We find that a successful generation of spectral data requires two modifications to conventional GANs: (i) the introduction of Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) to avoid mode collapse, and, (ii) the conditioning of WGANs to obtain accurate labels for the generated data. We show that a simple feed-forward neural network (FFNN), when augmented with data generated by a CWGAN, enhances significantly its performance under conditions of limited data availability, demonstrating the intrinsic value of CWGAN data augmentation beyond simply providing larger datasets. In addition, we show that CWGANs can act as a surrogate model with improved performance in the low-data regime with respect to simple FFNNs.
