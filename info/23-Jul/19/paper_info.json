    "abstract": "The automated code evaluation system (AES) is mainly designed to reliably assess user-submitted code. Due to their extensive range of applications and the accumulation of valuable resources, AESs are becoming increasingly popular. Research on the application of AES and their real-world resource exploration for diverse coding tasks is still lacking. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive survey on AESs and their resources. This survey explores the application areas of AESs, available resources, and resource utilization for coding tasks. AESs are categorized into programming contests, programming learning and education, recruitment, online compilers, and additional modules, depending on their application. We explore the available datasets and other resources of these systems for research, analysis, and coding tasks. Moreover, we provide an overview of machine learning-driven coding tasks, such as bug detection, code review, comprehension, refactoring, search, representation, and repair. These tasks are performed using real-life datasets. In addition, we briefly discuss the Aizu Online Judge platform as a real example of an AES from the perspectives of system design (hardware and software), operation (competition and education), and research. This is due to the scalability of the AOJ platform (programming education, competitions, and practice), open internal features (hardware and software), attention from the research community, open source data (e.g., solution codes and submission documents), and transparency. We also analyze the overall performance of this system and the perceived challenges over the years. ",

    "title": "Intuitionistic Fuzzy Broad Learning System: Enhancing Robustness Against  Noise and Outliers",
    "abstract": "In the realm of data classification, broad learning system (BLS) has proven to be a potent tool that utilizes a layer-by-layer feed-forward neural network. It consists of feature learning and enhancement segments, working together to extract intricate features from input data. The traditional BLS treats all samples as equally significant, which makes it less robust and less effective for real-world datasets with noises and outliers. To address this issue, we propose the fuzzy BLS (F-BLS) model, which assigns a fuzzy membership value to each training point to reduce the influence of noises and outliers. In assigning the membership value, the F-BLS model solely considers the distance from samples to the class center in the original feature space without incorporating the extent of non-belongingness to a class. We further propose a novel BLS based on intuitionistic fuzzy theory (IF-BLS). The proposed IF-BLS utilizes intuitionistic fuzzy numbers based on fuzzy membership and non-membership values to assign scores to training points in the high-dimensional feature space by using a kernel function. We evaluate the performance of proposed F-BLS and IF-BLS models on 44 UCI benchmark datasets across diverse domains. Furthermore, Gaussian noise is added to some UCI datasets to assess the robustness of the proposed F-BLS and IF-BLS models. Experimental results demonstrate superior generalization performance of the proposed F-BLS and IF-BLS models compared to baseline models, both with and without Gaussian noise. Additionally, we implement the proposed F-BLS and IF-BLS models on the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and promising results showcase the models effectiveness in real-world applications. The proposed methods offer a promising solution to enhance the BLS frameworks ability to handle noise and outliers. ",

We propose discovering a task graph automatically from how-to videos to represent probabilistically how people tend to execute keysteps, and then leverage this graph to regularize keystep recognition in novel videos. On multiple datasets of real-world instructional videos, we show the impact: more reliable zero-shot keystep localization and improved video representation learning, exceeding the state of the art.

    "abstract": "Exfiltration of data via email is a serious cybersecurity threat for many organizations. Detecting data exfiltration (anomaly) patterns typically requires labeling, most often done by a human annotator, to reduce the high number of false alarms. Active Learning (AL) is a promising approach for labeling data efficiently, but it needs to choose an efficient order in which cases are to be labeled, and there are uncertainties as to what scoring procedure should be used to prioritize cases for labeling, especially when detecting rare cases of interest is crucial. We propose an adaptive AL sampling strategy that leverages the underlying prior data distribution, as well as model uncertainty, to produce batches of cases to be labeled that contain instances of rare anomalies. We show that (1) the classifier benefits from a batch of representative and informative instances of both normal and anomalous examples, (2) unsupervised anomaly detection plays a useful role in building the classifier in the early stages of training when relatively little labeling has been done thus far. Our approach to AL for anomaly detection outperformed existing AL approaches on three highly unbalanced UCI benchmarks and on one real-world redacted email data set. ",

    "abstract": "Load-altering attacks targetting a large number of IoT-based high-wattage devices (e.g., smart electric vehicle charging stations) can lead to serious disruptions of power grid operations. In this work, we aim to uncover spatiotemporal characteristics of LAAs that can lead to serious impact. The problem is challenging since existing protection measures such as $N-1$ security ensures that the power grid is naturally resilient to load changes. Thus, strategically injected load perturbations that lead to network failure can be regarded as \\emph{rare events}. To this end, we adopt a rare-event sampling approach to uncover LAAs distributed temporally and spatially across the power network. The key advantage of this sampling method is the ability of sampling efficiently from multi-modal conditional distributions with disconnected support. Furthermore, we systematically compare the impacts of static (one-time manipulation of demand) and dynamic (attack over multiple time periods) LAAs. We perform extensive simulations using benchmark IEEE test simulations. The results show (i) the superiority and the need for rare-event sampling in the context of uncovering LAAs as compared to other sampling methodologies, (ii) statistical analysis of attack characteristics and impacts of static and dynamic LAAs, and (iii) cascade sizes (due to LAA) for different network sizes and load conditions.

However, existing diffusion-based graph generative models are mostly one-shot generative models that apply Gaussian diffusion in the dequantized adjacency matrix space. Such a strategy can suffer from difficulty in model training, slow sampling speed, and incapability of incorporating constraints. We propose an \\emph{autoregressive diffusion} model for graph generation. Unlike existing methods, we define a node-absorbing diffusion process that operates directly in the discrete graph space. For forward diffusion, we design a \\emph{diffusion ordering network}, which learns a data-dependent node absorbing ordering from graph topology. For reverse generation, we design a \\emph{denoising network} that uses the reverse node ordering to efficiently reconstruct the graph by predicting the node type of the new node and its edges with previously denoised nodes at a time. Based on the permutation invariance of graph, we show that the two networks can be jointly trained by optimizing a simple lower bound of data likelihood. Our experiments on six diverse generic graph datasets and two molecule datasets show that our model achieves better or comparable generation performance with previous state-of-the-art, and meanwhile enjoys fast generation speed.

In this paper, we propose a new perspective on curriculum learning by introducing a novel approach that builds on graph complexity formalisms (as difficulty criteria) and model competence during training. The model consists of a scheduling scheme which derives effective curricula by accounting for different views of sample difficulty and model competence during training. The proposed solution advances existing research in curriculum learning for graph neural networks with the ability to incorporate a fine-grained spectrum of graph difficulty criteria in their training paradigms.

A typical approach is to rely on Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures, which encode inputs in high-dimensional latent spaces that are repeatedly transformed during the execution of the algorithm. In this work we perform a detailed analysis of the structure of the latent space induced by the GNN when executing algorithms. We identify two possible failure modes: (i) loss of resolution, making it hard to distinguish similar values; (ii) inability to deal with values outside the range observed during training. We propose to solve the first issue by relying on a softmax aggregator, and propose to decay the latent space in order to deal with out-of-range values.

To this end, we propose two novel uncertainty set formulations, one based on double sampling and the other on an integral probability metric. Both make large-scale robust RL tractable even when one only has access to a simulator. We propose a robust natural actor-critic (RNAC) approach that incorporates the new uncertainty sets and employs function approximation. We provide finite-time convergence guarantees for the proposed RNAC algorithm to the optimal robust policy within the function approximation error.

We explore the interplay between node attributes and graph topology and demonstrate that incorporating pre-trained node attributes improves the generalization power of link prediction models. Our proposed method, UPNA (Unsupervised Pre-training of Node Attributes), solves the inductive link prediction problem by learning a function that takes a pair of node attributes and predicts the probability of an edge, as opposed to Graph Neural Networks (GNN), which can be prone to topological shortcuts in graphs with power-law degree distribution. In this manner, UPNA learns a significant part of the latent graph generation mechanism since the learned function can be used to add incoming nodes to a growing graph. By leveraging pre-trained node attributes, we overcome observational bias and make meaningful predictions about unobserved nodes, surpassing state-of-the-art performance (3X to 34X improvement on benchmark datasets). UPNA can be applied to various pairwise learning tasks and integrated with existing link prediction models to enhance their generalizability and bolster graph generative models. ",

The use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in computer vision, in particular, has yielded reliable results. In order to achieve these results, a large amount of data is required. However, the dataset cannot always be accessible. Moreover, annotating data can be difficult and time-consuming. Self-training is a semi-supervised approach that managed to alleviate this problem and achieve state-of-the-art performances. Theoretical analysis even proved that it may result in a better generalization than a normal classifier. Another problem neural networks can face is the increasing complexity of modern problems, requiring a high computational and storage cost. One way to mitigate this issue, a strategy that has been inspired by human cognition known as modular learning, can be employed. The principle of the approach is to decompose a complex problem into simpler sub-tasks. This approach has several advantages, including faster learning, better generalization, and enables interpretability. In the first part of this paper, we introduce and evaluate different architectures of modular learning for Dorsal Capsulo-Scapholunate Septum (DCSS) instability classification. Our experiments have shown that modular learning improves performances compared to non-modular systems. Moreover, we found that weighted modular, that is to weight the output using the probabilities from the gating module, achieved an almost perfect classification.

It aims at tackling these two challenges. This article advocates the use of the INC paradigm to tackle holographic applications' high bandwidth and low latency challenges instead of the edge computing paradigm that has been used so far. Slicing brings flexibility to next-generation networks by enabling the deployment of applications/verticals with different requirements on the same network infrastructure. We propose an architecture that enables the provisioning of INC-enabled slices for holographic-type application deployment. The architecture is validated through a proof of concept and extensive simulations.

    "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning-based Content Migration for Edge Content  Delivery Networks with Vehicular Nodes",
    "abstract": "With the explosive demands for data, content delivery networks are facing ever-increasing challenges to meet end-users quality-of-experience requirements, especially in terms of delay. Content can be migrated from surrogate servers to local caches closer to end-users to address delay challenges. Unfortunately, these local caches have limited capacities, and when they are fully occupied, it may sometimes be necessary to remove their lower-priority content to accommodate higher-priority content. At other times, it may be necessary to return previously removed content to local caches. Downloading this content from surrogate servers is costly from the perspective of network usage, and potentially detrimental to the end-user QoE in terms of delay. In this paper, we consider an edge content delivery network with vehicular nodes and propose a content migration strategy in which local caches offload their contents to neighboring edge caches whenever feasible, instead of removing their contents when they are fully occupied. This process ensures that more contents remain in the vicinity of end-users. However, selecting which contents to migrate and to which neighboring cache to migrate is a complicated problem. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning approach to minimize the cost. Our simulation scenarios realized up to a 70% reduction of content access delay cost compared to conventional strategies with and without content migration. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive performance in collaborative filtering. However, GNNs tend to yield inferior performance when the distributions of training and test data are not aligned well. Also, training GNNs requires optimizing non-convex neural networks with an abundance of local and global minima, which may differ widely in their performance at test time. Thus, it is essential to choose the minima carefully. Here we propose an effective training schema, called {gSAM}, under the principle that the \\textit{flatter} minima has a better generalization ability than the \\textit{sharper} ones. To achieve this goal, gSAM regularizes the flatness of the weight loss landscape by forming a bi-level optimization: the outer problem conducts the standard model training while the inner problem helps the model jump out of the sharp minima. Experimental results show the superiority of our gSAM. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising approach for extracting valuable representations from unlabeled data. One successful SSL method is contrastive learning, which aims to bring positive examples closer while pushing negative examples apart. Many current contrastive learning approaches utilize a parameterized projection head. Through a combination of empirical analysis and theoretical investigation, we provide insights into the internal mechanisms of the projection head and its relationship with the phenomenon of dimensional collapse. Our findings demonstrate that the projection head enhances the quality of representations by performing contrastive loss in a projected subspace. Therefore, we propose an assumption that only a subset of features is necessary when minimizing the contrastive loss of a mini-batch of data. Theoretical analysis further suggests that a sparse projection head can enhance generalization, leading us to introduce SparseHead - a regularization term that effectively constrains the sparsity of the projection head, and can be seamlessly integrated with any self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of SparseHead, demonstrating its ability to improve the performance of existing contrastive methods. ",

    "abstract": "For many applications of classifiers to medical images, a trustworthy label for each image can be difficult or expensive to obtain. In contrast, images without labels are more readily available. Two major research directions both promise that additional unlabeled data can improve classifier performance: self-supervised learning pretrains useful representations on unlabeled data only, then fine-tunes a classifier on these representations via the labeled set; semi-supervised learning directly trains a classifier on labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously. Recent methods from both directions have claimed significant gains on non-medical tasks, but do not systematically assess medical images and mostly compare only to methods in the same direction. This study contributes a carefully-designed benchmark to help answer a practitioner's key question: given a small labeled dataset and a limited budget of hours to spend on training, what gains from additional unlabeled images are possible and which methods best achieve them? Unlike previous benchmarks, ours uses realistic-sized validation sets to select hyperparameters, assesses runtime-performance tradeoffs, and bridges two research fields. By comparing 6 semi-supervised methods and 5 self-supervised methods to strong labeled-only baselines on 3 medical datasets with 30-1000 labels per class, we offer insights to resource-constrained, results-focused practitioners: MixMatch, SimCLR, and BYOL represent strong choices that were not surpassed by more recent methods. After much effort selecting hyperparameters on one dataset, we publish settings that enable strong methods to perform well on new medical tasks within a few hours, with further search over dozens of hours delivering modest additional gains.

Instead, it is self-supervised by enforcing consistency of matchings between images of the same object category. As the matching and the consistency loss are discrete, their derivatives cannot be straightforwardly used for learning. We address this issue in a principled way by building our method upon the recent results on black-box differentiation of combinatorial solvers.

Despite being deemed as universal function approximators, neural networks, in practice, struggle to reduce the prediction errors below $O(10^{-5})$ even with large network size and extended training iterations. To address this issue, we developed the multi-stage neural networks that divides the training process into different stages, with each stage using a new network that is optimized to fit the residue from the previous stage. Across successive stages, the residue magnitudes decreases substantially and follows an inverse power-law relationship with the residue frequencies. The multi-stage neural networks effectively mitigate the spectral biases associated with regular neural networks, enabling them to capture the high frequency feature of target functions. We demonstrate that the prediction error from the multi-stage training for both regression problems and physics-informed neural networks can nearly reach the machine-precision $O(10^{-16})$ of double-floating point within a finite number of iterations. Such levels of accuracy are rarely attainable using single neural networks alone. ",

The trained model maps the activity data samples into fixed size representation vectors such that the distance between the vectors in the representation space approximates the similarity of the data samples in the input space. Thus, the trained model can work as a metric for a wide range of different clustering algorithms. The training process minimizes a similarity loss function that forces the distance metric to be small for pairs of samples from the same kind of activity, and large for pairs of samples from different kinds of activities. We evaluate the model on three datasets to verify its effectiveness in segmentation and recognition of continuous human activity sequences. ",

This is an essential process for ensuring that only authorized devices can access the network, and it is necessary for network management and maintenance.

However, these models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can compromise their accuracy and effectiveness. To better secure device identification models, discretization techniques enable reduction in the sensitivity of machine learning models to adversarial attacks contributing to the stability and reliability of the model. On the other hand, Ensemble methods combine multiple heterogeneous models to reduce the impact of remaining noise or errors in the model. Therefore, in this paper, we integrate discretization techniques and ensemble methods and examine it on model robustness against adversarial attacks. In other words, we propose a discretization-based ensemble stacking technique to improve the security of our ML models. We evaluate the performance of different ML-based IoT device identification models against white box and black box attacks using a real-world dataset comprised of network traffic from 28 IoT devices.

Nevertheless, a large number of weights in pre-trained deep neural networks prohibit them from being deployed on smartphones and embedded systems. It is highly desirable to obtain lightweight versions of neural networks for inference in edge devices. Many cost-effective approaches were proposed to prune dense and convolutional layers that are common in deep neural networks and dominant in the parameter space. However, a unified theoretical foundation for the problem mostly is missing. In this paper, we identify the close connection between matrix spectrum learning and neural network training for dense and convolutional layers and argue that weight pruning is essentially a matrix sparsification process to preserve the spectrum. Based on the analysis, we also propose a matrix sparsification algorithm tailored for neural network pruning that yields better pruning result. We carefully design and conduct experiments to support our arguments. Hence we provide a consolidated viewpoint for neural network pruning and enhance the interpretability of deep neural networks by identifying and preserving the critical neural weights. ",

Existing VidVRD methods can be broadly categorized into bottom-up and top-down paradigms, depending on their approach to classifying relations. Bottom-up methods follow a clip-based approach where they classify relations of short clip tubelet pairs and then merge them into long video relations. On the other hand, top-down methods directly classify long video tubelet pairs. While recent video-based methods utilizing video tubelets have shown promising results, we argue that the effective modeling of spatial and temporal context plays a more significant role than the choice between clip tubelets and video tubelets. This motivates us to revisit the clip-based paradigm and explore the key success factors in VidVRD. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Context Model (HCM) that enriches the object-based spatial context and relation-based temporal context based on clips. We demonstrate that using clip tubelets can achieve superior performance compared to most video-based methods. Additionally, using clip tubelets offers more flexibility in model designs and helps alleviate the limitations associated with video tubelets, such as the challenging long-term object tracking problem and the loss of temporal information in long-term tubelet feature compression. Extensive experiments conducted on two challenging VidVRD benchmarks validate that our HCM achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of incorporating advanced spatial and temporal context modeling within the clip-based paradigm.

However, the performance of previous computational models is limited by the following drawbacks. The learning of drug representation relies only on supervised data, without taking into account the information contained in the molecular graph itself. Moreover, most previous studies tended to design complicated representation learning module, while uniformity, which is used to measure representation quality, is ignored. In this study, we propose GraphCL-DTA, a graph contrastive learning with molecular semantics for drug-target binding affinity prediction. In GraphCL-DTA, we design a graph contrastive learning framework for molecular graphs to learn drug representations, so that the semantics of molecular graphs are preserved. Through this graph contrastive framework, a more essential and effective drug representation can be learned without additional supervised data. Next, we design a new loss function that can be directly used to smoothly adjust the uniformity of drug and target representations. By directly optimizing the uniformity of representations, the representation quality of drugs and targets can be improved. The effectiveness of the above innovative elements is verified on two real datasets, KIBA and Davis. The excellent performance of GraphCL-DTA on the above datasets suggests its superiority to the state-of-the-art model. ",

It not only back projects feature residues but also coordinates residues so that the network better captures the point correlations in the feature and space domains, achieving lower reconstruction errors on both uniform and non-uniform sparse point clouds. Our proposed method is also generalizable for arbitrary upsampling tasks (e.g. 4x, 5.5x).

However, these methods only focus on the information from a single streamline, ignoring geometric relationships between the streamlines in the brain. We propose TractCloud, a registration-free framework that performs whole-brain tractography parcellation directly in individual subject space. We propose a novel, learnable, local-global streamline representation that leverages information from neighboring and whole-brain streamlines to describe the local anatomy and global pose of the brain. We train our framework on a large-scale labeled tractography dataset, which we augment by applying synthetic transforms including rotation, scaling, and translations. We test our framework on five independently acquired datasets across populations and health conditions. TractCloud significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on all testing datasets. TractCloud achieves efficient and consistent whole-brain white matter parcellation across the lifespan (from neonates to elderly subjects, including brain tumor patients) without the need for registration.

CBSeq is a method that constructs a stable traffic representation, behavior sequence, to characterize attacking intent and achieve malware traffic detection. We novelly propose the channels with similar behavior as the detection object and extract side-channel content to construct behavior sequence. Unlike benign activities, the behavior sequences of malware and its variant's traffic exhibit solid internal correlations. Moreover, we design the MSFormer, a powerful Transformer-based multi-sequence fusion classifier. It captures the internal similarity of behavior sequence, thereby distinguishing malware traffic from benign traffic.

Furthermore, we use the gated mapping unit and facial structure, identity, and segmentation losses to preserve the facial structure and details. This enables us to train the network with a very limited amount of data while generating high-quality stylized images. Our training process adapts curriculum learning strategy to perform efficient and flexible style mixing in the generative space.

    "abstract": "We present a new method to adapt an RGB-trained water segmentation network to target-domain aerial thermal imagery using online self-supervision by leveraging texture and motion cues as supervisory signals. This new thermal capability enables current autonomous aerial robots operating in near-shore environments to perform tasks such as visual navigation, bathymetry, and flow tracking at night. Our method overcomes the problem of scarce and difficult-to-obtain near-shore thermal data that prevents the application of conventional supervised and unsupervised methods. In this work, we curate the first aerial thermal near-shore dataset, show that our approach outperforms fully-supervised segmentation models trained on limited target-domain thermal data, and demonstrate real-time capabilities onboard an Nvidia Jetson embedded computing platform.

    "abstract": "For problems in image processing and many other fields, a large class of effective neural networks has encoder-decoder-based architectures. Although these networks have made impressive performances, mathematical explanations of their architectures are still underdeveloped. In this paper, we study the encoder-decoder-based network architecture from the algorithmic perspective and provide a mathematical explanation. We use the two-phase Potts model for image segmentation as an example for our explanations. We associate the segmentation problem with a control problem in the continuous setting. Then, multigrid method and operator splitting scheme, the PottsMGNet, are used to discretize the continuous control model. We show that the resulting discrete PottsMGNet is equivalent to an encoder-decoder-based network. With minor modifications, it is shown that a number of the popular encoder-decoder-based neural networks are just instances of the proposed PottsMGNet. By incorporating the Soft-Threshold-Dynamics into the PottsMGNet as a regularizer, the PottsMGNet has shown to be robust with the network parameters such as network width and depth and achieved remarkable performance on datasets with very large noise. In nearly all our experiments, the new network always performs better or as good on accuracy and dice score than existing networks for image segmentation. ",

In the literature of mathematical analysis of deep deep neural networks, a lot of works are dedicated to establishing representation theories. How to make connections between deep neural networks and mathematical algorithms is still under development. In this paper, we give an algorithmic explanation for deep neural networks, especially in their connection with operator splitting and multigrid methods. We show that with certain splitting strategies, operator-splitting methods have the same structure as networks. Utilizing this connection and the Potts model for image segmentation, two networks inspired by operator-splitting methods are proposed. The two networks are essentially two operator-splitting algorithms solving the Potts model. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed networks. ",

Instead, we propose a novel end-to-end differentiable graph generator which builds graph topologies where each node selects both its neighborhood and its size. Our module can be readily integrated into existing pipelines involving graph convolution operations, replacing the predetermined or existing adjacency matrix with one that is learned, and optimized, as part of the general objective. As such it is applicable to any GCN. We integrate our module into trajectory prediction, point cloud classification and node classification pipelines resulting in improved accuracy over other structure-learning methods across a wide range of datasets and GCN backbones.

An adversary that monitors all communications can leverage the churn to learn who is publishing what with increasing confidence over time. In this paper, we propose a protocol for mitigating intersection attacks in anonymous microblogging systems by grouping users into anonymity sets based on similarities in their publishing behavior. The protocol provides a configurable communication schedule for users in each set to manage the inevitable trade-off between latency and bandwidth overhead. In our evaluation, we use real-world datasets from two popular microblogging platforms, Twitter and Reddit, to simulate user publishing behavior. The results demonstrate that the protocol can protect users against intersection attacks at low bandwidth overhead when the users adhere to communication schedules. In addition, the protocol can sustain a slow degradation in the size of the anonymity set over time under various churn rates. ",

Our method differs from existing methods in that it can generalize to any input image for animatable human synthesis. Given a random pose sequence, our method synthesizes each target scene using a neural radiance field that is conditioned on a canonical representation and pose-aware pixel-aligned features, both of which can be obtained through deformation fields learned in a data-driven manner. Our experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiview and novel pose synthesis from few-shot images. ",

Here the Mining of Single-Class by Active Learning (MiSiCAL) paradigm is introduced where an AL policy is constructed through deep reinforcement learning and exploits quantity-accuracy correlations to build datasets on which high-performance models can be trained with regards to specific classes. MiSiCAL is especially helpful in the case of very large batch sizes since it does not require repeated model training sessions as is common in other AL methods. This is thanks to its ability to exploit fixed representations of the candidate data points. We find that MiSiCAL is able to outperform a random policy on 150 out of 171 COCO10k classes, while the strongest baseline only outperforms random on 101 classes. ",

    "abstract": "In cut sparsification, all cuts of a hypergraph $H=(V,E,w)$ are approximated within $1\\pm\\epsilon$ factor by a small hypergraph $H'$. This widely applied method was generalized recently to a setting where the cost of cutting each $e\\in E$ is provided by a splitting function, $g_e: 2^e\\to\\mathbb{R}_+$. This generalization is called a submodular hypergraph when the functions $\\{g_e\\}_{e\\in E}$ are submodular, and it arises in machine learning, combinatorial optimization, and algorithmic game theory. Previous work focused on the setting where $H'$ is a reweighted sub-hypergraph of $H$, and measured size by the number of hyperedges in $H'$. We study such sparsification, and also a more general notion of representing $H$ succinctly, where size is measured in bits. In the sparsification setting, where size is the number of hyperedges, we present three results: (i) all submodular hypergraphs admit sparsifiers of size polynomial in $n=|V|$; (ii) monotone-submodular hypergraphs admit sparsifiers of size $O(\\epsilon^{-2} n^3)$; and (iii) we propose a new parameter, called spread, to obtain even smaller sparsifiers in some cases. In the succinct-representation setting, we show that a natural family of splitting functions admits a succinct representation of much smaller size than via reweighted subgraphs (almost by factor $n$). This large gap is surprising because for graphs, the most succinct representation is attained by reweighted subgraphs. Along the way, we introduce the notion of deformation, where $g_e$ is decomposed into a sum of functions of small description, and we provide upper and lower bounds for deformation of common splitting functions.

By training on a combination of MSDA and non-MSDA data, the proposed method not only improves the performance of classes that were previously degraded by MSDA, but also increases overall average accuracy, as shown in experiments on two datasets (CIFAR-100 and ImageNet) using three MSDA methods (Mixup, CutMix and PuzzleMix).

To solve large instances, SAT solvers have to rely on heuristics, e.g., choosing a branching variable in DPLL and CDCL solvers. Such heuristics can be improved with machine learning (ML) models; they can reduce the number of steps but usually hinder the running time because useful models are relatively large and slow. We suggest the strategy of making a few initial steps with a trained ML model and then releasing control to classical heuristics; this simplifies cold start for SAT solving and can decrease both the number of steps and overall runtime, but requires a separate decision of when to release control to the solver. Moreover, we introduce a modification of Graph-Q-SAT tailored to SAT problems converted from other domains, e.g., open shop scheduling problems. We validate the feasibility of our approach with random and industrial SAT problems. ",

    "abstract": "Model-driven software engineering is a suitable method for dealing with the ever-increasing complexity of software development processes. Graphs and graph transformations have proven useful for representing such models and changes to them. These models must satisfy certain sets of constraints. An example are the multiplicities of a class structure. During the development process, a change to a model may result in an inconsistent model that must at some point be repaired. This problem is called model repair. In particular, we will consider rule-based graph repair which is defined as follows: Given a graph $G$, a constraint $c$ such that $G$ does not satisfy $c$, and a set of rules $R$, use the rules of $\\mathcal{R}$ to transform $G$ into a graph that satisfies $c$. Known notions of consistency have either viewed consistency as a binary property, either a graph is consistent w.r.t. a constraint $c$ or not, or only viewed the number of violations of the first graph of a constraint. In this thesis, we introduce new notions of consistency, which we call consistency-maintaining and consistency-increasing transformations and rules, respectively. This is based on the possibility that a constraint can be satisfied up to a certain nesting level. We present constructions for direct consistency-maintaining or direct consistency-increasing application conditions, respectively. Finally, we present an rule-based graph repair approach that is able to repair so-called \\emph{circular conflict-free constraints}, and so-called circular conflict-free sets of constraints. Intuitively, a set of constraint $C$ is circular conflict free, if there is an ordering $c_1, \\ldots, c_n$ of all constraints of $C$ such that there is no $j <i$ such that a repair of $c_i$ at all graphs satisfying $c_j$ leads to a graph not satisfying $c_j$.

Various standardization organizations, like 3GPP's proposal for new generation networks and state-of-the-art 5G/6G research projects, are proposing new NS architectures.

    "title": "Pixel-wise Graph Attention Networks for Person Re-identification",
    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCN) is widely used to handle irregular data since it updates node features by using the structure information of graph. With the help of iterated GCN, high-order information can be obtained to further enhance the representation of nodes. However, how to apply GCN to structured data (such as pictures) has not been deeply studied. In this paper, we explore the application of graph attention networks (GAT) in image feature extraction. First of all, we propose a novel graph generation algorithm to convert images into graphs through matrix transformation. It is one magnitude faster than the algorithm based on K Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Then, GAT is used on the generated graph to update the node features. Thus, a more robust representation is obtained. These two steps are combined into a module called pixel-wise graph attention module (PGA). Since the graph obtained by our graph generation algorithm can still be transformed into a picture after processing, PGA can be well combined with CNN. Based on these two modules, we consulted the ResNet and design a pixel-wise graph attention network (PGANet). The PGANet is applied to the task of person re-identification in the datasets Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID and Occluded-DukeMTMC (outperforms state-of-the-art by 0.8\\%, 1.1\\% and 11\\% respectively, in mAP scores). Experiment results show that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance. \\href{https://github.com/wenyu1009/PGANet}{The code is available here}. ",

    "abstract": "Chest X-ray (CXR) anatomical abnormality detection aims at localizing and characterising cardiopulmonary radiological findings in the radiographs, which can expedite clinical workflow and reduce observational oversights. Most existing methods attempted this task in either fully supervised settings which demanded costly mass per-abnormality annotations, or weakly supervised settings which still lagged badly behind fully supervised methods in performance. In this work, we propose a co-evolutionary image and report distillation (CEIRD) framework, which approaches semi-supervised abnormality detection in CXR by grounding the visual detection results with text-classified abnormalities from paired radiology reports, and vice versa. Concretely, based on the classical teacher-student pseudo label distillation (TSD) paradigm, we additionally introduce an auxiliary report classification model, whose prediction is used for report-guided pseudo detection label refinement (RPDLR) in the primary vision detection task. Inversely, we also use the prediction of the vision detection model for abnormality-guided pseudo classification label refinement (APCLR) in the auxiliary report classification task, and propose a co-evolution strategy where the vision and report models mutually promote each other with RPDLR and APCLR performed alternatively. To this end, we effectively incorporate the weak supervision by reports into the semi-supervised TSD pipeline. Besides the cross-modal pseudo label refinement, we further propose an intra-image-modal self-adaptive non-maximum suppression, where the pseudo detection labels generated by the teacher vision model are dynamically rectified by high-confidence predictions by the student. Experimental results on the public MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate CEIRD's superior performance to several up-to-date weakly and semi-supervised methods. ",

    "abstract": "As the most fundamental tasks of computer vision, object detection and segmentation have made tremendous progress in the deep learning era. Due to the expensive manual labeling, the annotated categories in existing datasets are often small-scale and pre-defined, i.e., state-of-the-art detectors and segmentors fail to generalize beyond the closed-vocabulary. To resolve this limitation, the last few years have witnessed increasing attention toward Open-Vocabulary Detection (OVD) and Segmentation (OVS). In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review on the past and recent development of OVD and OVS. To this end, we develop a taxonomy according to the type of task and methodology. We find that the permission and usage of weak supervision signals can well discriminate different methodologies, including: visual-semantic space mapping, novel visual feature synthesis, region-aware training, pseudo-labeling, knowledge distillation-based, and transfer learning-based. The proposed taxonomy is universal across different tasks, covering object detection, semantic/instance/panoptic segmentation, 3D scene and video understanding. In each category, its main principles, key challenges, development routes, strengths, and weaknesses are thoroughly discussed. In addition, we benchmark each task along with the vital components of each method. Finally, several promising directions are provided to stimulate future research. ",

    "abstract": "It is universally acknowledged that Wi-Fi communications are important to secure. Thus, the Wi-Fi Alliance published WPA3 in 2018 with a distinctive security feature: it leverages a Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol to protect users' passwords from offline dictionary attacks. Unfortunately, soon after its release, several attacks were reported against its implementations, in response to which the protocol was updated in a best-effort manner. In this paper, we show that the proposed mitigations are not enough, especially for a complex protocol to implement even for savvy developers. Indeed, we present **Dragondoom**, a collection of side-channel vulnerabilities of varying strength allowing attackers to recover users' passwords in widely deployed Wi-Fi daemons, such as hostap in its default settings. Our findings target both password conversion methods, namely the default probabilistic hunting-and-pecking and its newly standardized deterministic alternative based on SSWU. We successfully exploit our leakage in practice through microarchitectural mechanisms, and overcome the limited spatial resolution of Flush+Reload. Our attacks outperform previous works in terms of required measurements. Then, driven by the need to end the spiral of patch-and-hack in Dragonfly implementations, we propose **Dragonstar**, an implementation of Dragonfly leveraging a formally verified implementation of the underlying mathematical operations, thereby removing all the related leakage vector. Our implementation relies on HACL*, a formally verified crypto library guaranteeing secret-independence. We design Dragonstar, so that its integration within hostap requires minimal modifications to the existing project. Our experiments show that the performance of HACL*-based hostap is comparable to OpenSSL-based, implying that Dragonstar is both efficient and proved to be leakage-free. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have witnessed the groundbreaking impact of pretrained models, yielding impressive outcomes across various tasks. This study seeks to extend the power of pretraining methodologies to tabular data, a domain traditionally overlooked, yet inherently challenging due to the plethora of table schemas intrinsic to different tasks. The primary research questions underpinning this work revolve around the adaptation to heterogeneous table structures, the establishment of a universal pretraining protocol for tabular data, the generalizability and transferability of learned knowledge across tasks, the adaptation to diverse downstream applications, and the incorporation of incremental columns over time. In response to these challenges, we introduce UniTabE, a pioneering method designed to process tables in a uniform manner, devoid of constraints imposed by specific table structures. UniTabE's core concept relies on representing each basic table element with a module, termed TabUnit. This is subsequently followed by a Transformer encoder to refine the representation. Moreover, our model is designed to facilitate pretraining and finetuning through the utilization of free-form prompts. In order to implement the pretraining phase, we curated an expansive tabular dataset comprising approximately 13 billion samples, meticulously gathered from the Kaggle platform. Rigorous experimental testing and analyses were performed under a myriad of scenarios to validate the effectiveness of our methodology. The experimental results demonstrate UniTabE's superior performance against several baseline models across a multitude of benchmark datasets. This, therefore, underscores UniTabE's potential to significantly enhance the semantic representation of tabular data, thereby marking a significant stride in the field of tabular data analysis. ",

    "abstract": "Siamese networks have gained popularity as a method for modeling text semantic similarity. Traditional methods rely on pooling operation to compress the semantic representations from Transformer blocks in encoding, resulting in two-dimensional semantic vectors and the loss of hierarchical semantic information from Transformer blocks. Moreover, this limited structure of semantic vectors is akin to a flattened landscape, which restricts the methods that can be applied in downstream modeling, as they can only navigate this flat terrain. To address this issue, we propose a novel 3D Siamese network for text semantic similarity modeling, which maps semantic information to a higher-dimensional space. The three-dimensional semantic tensors not only retains more precise spatial and feature domain information but also provides the necessary structural condition for comprehensive downstream modeling strategies to capture them. Leveraging this structural advantage, we introduce several modules to reinforce this 3D framework, focusing on three aspects: feature extraction, attention, and feature fusion. Our extensive experiments on four text semantic similarity benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our 3D Siamese Network. ",

    "title": "Rumor Detection with Diverse Counterfactual Evidence",
    "abstract": "The growth in social media has exacerbated the threat of fake news to individuals and communities. This draws increasing attention to developing efficient and timely rumor detection methods. The prevailing approaches resort to graph neural networks (GNNs) to exploit the post-propagation patterns of the rumor-spreading process. However, these methods lack inherent interpretation of rumor detection due to the black-box nature of GNNs. Moreover, these methods suffer from less robust results as they employ all the propagation patterns for rumor detection. In this paper, we address the above issues with the proposed Diverse Counterfactual Evidence framework for Rumor Detection (DCE-RD). Our intuition is to exploit the diverse counterfactual evidence of an event graph to serve as multi-view interpretations, which are further aggregated for robust rumor detection results. Specifically, our method first designs a subgraph generation strategy to efficiently generate different subgraphs of the event graph. We constrain the removal of these subgraphs to cause the change in rumor detection results. Thus, these subgraphs naturally serve as counterfactual evidence for rumor detection. To achieve multi-view interpretation, we design a diversity loss inspired by Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) to encourage diversity among the counterfactual evidence. A GNN-based rumor detection model further aggregates the diverse counterfactual evidence discovered by the proposed DCE-RD to achieve interpretable and robust rumor detection results. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show the superior performance of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Vicinity111/DCE-RD. ",

    "abstract": "In safety-critical classification tasks, conformal prediction allows to perform rigorous uncertainty quantification by providing confidence sets including the true class with a user-specified probability. This generally assumes the availability of a held-out calibration set with access to ground truth labels. Unfortunately, in many domains, such labels are difficult to obtain and usually approximated by aggregating expert opinions. In fact, this holds true for almost all datasets, including well-known ones such as CIFAR and ImageNet. Applying conformal prediction using such labels underestimates uncertainty. Indeed, when expert opinions are not resolvable, there is inherent ambiguity present in the labels. That is, we do not have ``crisp'', definitive ground truth labels and this uncertainty should be taken into account during calibration. In this paper, we develop a conformal prediction framework for such ambiguous ground truth settings which relies on an approximation of the underlying posterior distribution of labels given inputs. We demonstrate our methodology on synthetic and real datasets, including a case study of skin condition classification in dermatology. ",

Specifically, to improve the accuracy of dynamic head reconstruction, a compact and expressive NeRF-based Tri-Plane Hash Representation is introduced by pruning empty spatial regions with three planar hash encoders. For speech audio, we propose a Region Attention Module to generate region-aware condition feature via an attention mechanism. Different from existing methods that utilize an MLP-based encoder to learn the cross-modal relation implicitly, the attention mechanism builds an explicit connection between audio features and spatial regions to capture the priors of local motions. Moreover, a direct and fast Adaptive Pose Encoding is introduced to optimize the head-torso separation problem by mapping the complex transformation of the head pose into spatial coordinates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method renders better high-fidelity and audio-lips synchronized talking portrait videos, with realistic details and high efficiency compared to previous methods.

    "abstract": "Trajectory data collection is a common task with many applications in our daily lives. Analyzing trajectory data enables service providers to enhance their services, which ultimately benefits users. However, directly collecting trajectory data may give rise to privacy-related issues that cannot be ignored. Local differential privacy (LDP), as the de facto privacy protection standard in a decentralized setting, enables users to perturb their trajectories locally and provides a provable privacy guarantee. Existing approaches to private trajectory data collection in a local setting typically use relaxed versions of LDP, which cannot provide a strict privacy guarantee, or require some external knowledge that is impractical to obtain and update in a timely manner. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel trajectory perturbation mechanism that relies solely on an underlying location set and satisfies pure $\\epsilon$-LDP to provide a stringent privacy guarantee. In the proposed mechanism, each point's adjacent direction information in the trajectory is used in its perturbation process. Such information serves as an effective clue to connect neighboring points and can be used to restrict the possible region of a perturbed point in order to enhance utility. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to use direction information for trajectory perturbation under LDP. Furthermore, based on this mechanism, we present an anchor-based method that adaptively restricts the region of each perturbed trajectory, thereby significantly boosting performance without violating the privacy constraint. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms. ",

They show an impressive ability to predict the performance of architectures by making use of their untrained weights. These techniques allow for immense search speed-ups. So far the joint search for well-performing and robust architectures has received much less attention in the field of NAS. Therefore, the main focus of zero-cost proxies is the clean accuracy of architectures, whereas the model robustness should play an evenly important part. In this paper, we analyze the ability of common zero-cost proxies to serve as performance predictors for robustness in the popular NAS-Bench-201 search space. We are interested in the single prediction task for robustness and the joint multi-objective of clean and robust accuracy. We further analyze the feature importance of the proxies and show that predicting the robustness makes the prediction task from existing zero-cost proxies more challenging. As a result, the joint consideration of several proxies becomes necessary to predict a model's robustness while the clean accuracy can be regressed from a single such feature. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated their outperformance in various software systems, but also exhibit misbehavior and even result in irreversible disasters. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the misbehavior of DNN-based software and improve DNNs' quality. Test input prioritization is one of the most appealing ways to guarantee DNNs' quality, which prioritizes test inputs so that more bug-revealing inputs can be identified earlier with limited time and manual labeling efforts. However, the existing prioritization methods are still limited from three aspects: certifiability, effectiveness, and generalizability. To overcome the challenges, we propose CertPri, a test input prioritization technique designed based on a movement cost perspective of test inputs in DNNs' feature space. CertPri differs from previous works in three key aspects: (1) certifiable: it provides a formal robustness guarantee for the movement cost; (2) effective: it leverages formally guaranteed movement costs to identify malicious bug-revealing inputs; and (3) generic: it can be applied to various tasks, data, models, and scenarios. Extensive evaluations across 2 tasks (i.e., classification and regression), 6 data forms, 4 model structures, and 2 scenarios (i.e., white-box and black-box) demonstrate CertPri's superior performance. For instance, it significantly improves 53.97% prioritization effectiveness on average compared with baselines. Its robustness and generalizability are 1.41~2.00 times and 1.33~3.39 times that of baselines on average, respectively. ",

    "title": "Resilience of the reported global human-nature interaction network to  pandemic conditions",
    "abstract": "Understanding human-nature interactions and the architecture of coupled human-nature systems is crucial for sustainable development. Cultural ecosystem services (CES), defined as intangible benefits derived from nature exposure, contribute to maintaining and improving human well-being. However, we have limited understanding of how well-being benefits emerge from CES co-production. In this study, for the first time, we estimated the global CES network from self-reported interactions between nature features and human activities underpinning CES co-production using social media. First, we used a bottom-up, approach to define the global repertoire of nature features and human activities used during CES co-production using 682,000 posts on Reddit. We then sampled Twitter to estimate the co-occurrence of these features and activities over the past five years, retrieving 41.7 millions tweets. These tweets were used to estimate the CES bipartite network, where each link was weighted by the number of times nature features and human activities co-occurred in tweets. We expected to observe large changes in the CES network topology in relation to the global mobility restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was not the case and the global CES network was generally resilient. However, a higher order singular value decomposition of the CES tensor revealed an impulse on the link between self care activities and urban greenspace. This could be due to an increased need for self care during the pandemic and urban greenspace enabling CES to be produced locally. Thus, providing resilience for maintaining well-being during the pandemic. Our user based analysis also indicated a shift towards local CES production during the beginning of the pandemic. Thus, supporting that CES was produced locally. These findings suggest an overall need for CES and access to features providing CES in local communities. ",

    "abstract": "Index modulation schemes for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS)-assisted systems are envisioned as promising technologies for fifth-generation-advanced and sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems to enhance various system capabilities such as coverage area and network capacity. In this paper, we consider a receive diversity RIS-assisted wireless communication system employing IM schemes, namely, space-shift keying (SSK) for binary modulation and spatial modulation (SM) for M-ary modulation for data transmission. The RIS lies in close proximity to the transmitter, and the transmitted data is subjected to a fading environment with a prominent line-of-sight component modeled by a Rician distribution. A receiver structure based on a greedy detection rule is employed to select the receive diversity branch with the highest received signal energy for demodulation. The performance of the considered system is evaluated by obtaining a series-form expression for the probability of erroneous index detection (PED) of the considered target antenna using a characteristic function approach. In addition, closed-form and asymptotic expressions at high and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for the bit error rate (BER) for the SSK-based system, and the SM-based system employing M-ary phase-shift keying and M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation schemes, are derived. The dependencies of the system performance on the various parameters are corroborated via numerical results. The asymptotic expressions and results of PED and BER at high and low SNR values lead to the observation of a performance saturation and the presence of an SNR value as a point of inflection, which is attributed to the greedy detector's structure.

    "abstract": "The advancement of biomedical research heavily relies on access to large amounts of medical data. In the case of histopathology, Whole Slide Images (WSI) and clinicopathological information are valuable for developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Digital Pathology (DP). Transferring medical data \"as open as possible\" enhances the usability of the data for secondary purposes but poses a risk to patient privacy. At the same time, existing regulations push towards keeping medical data \"as closed as necessary\" to avoid re-identification risks. Generally, these legal regulations require the removal of sensitive data but do not consider the possibility of data linkage attacks due to modern image-matching algorithms. In addition, the lack of standardization in DP makes it harder to establish a single solution for all formats of WSIs. These challenges raise problems for bio-informatics researchers in balancing privacy and progress while developing AI algorithms. This paper explores the legal regulations and terminologies for medical data-sharing. We review existing approaches and highlight challenges from the histopathological perspective. We also present a data-sharing guideline for histological data to foster multidisciplinary research and education. ",

We give a new distributed algorithm that finds a $c$-coloring in $\\chi$-chromatic graphs in $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}})$ rounds, with $\\alpha = \\bigl\\lceil\\frac{c-1}{\\chi - 1}\\bigr\\rceil$. 2. We prove that any distributed algorithm for this problem requires $\\Omega(n^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}})$ rounds. Our upper bound holds in the classical, deterministic LOCAL model, while the near-matching lower bound holds in the \\emph{non-signaling} model. This model, introduced by Arfaoui and Fraigniaud in 2014, captures all models of distributed graph algorithms that obey physical causality; this includes not only classical deterministic LOCAL and randomized LOCAL but also quantum-LOCAL, even with a pre-shared quantum state. We also show that similar arguments can be used to prove that, e.g., 3-coloring 2-dimensional grids or $c$-coloring trees remain hard problems even for the non-signaling model, and in particular do not admit any quantum advantage. Our lower-bound arguments are purely graph-theoretic at heart; no background on quantum information theory is needed to establish the proofs. ",

    "abstract": "For real-world language applications, detecting an out-of-distribution (OOD) sample is helpful to alert users or reject such unreliable samples. However, modern over-parameterized language models often produce overconfident predictions for both in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. In particular, language models suffer from OOD samples with a similar semantic representation to ID samples since these OOD samples lie near the ID manifold. A rejection network can be trained with ID and diverse outlier samples to detect test OOD samples, but explicitly collecting auxiliary OOD datasets brings an additional burden for data collection. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method called Pseudo Outlier Exposure (POE) that constructs a surrogate OOD dataset by sequentially masking tokens related to ID classes. The surrogate OOD sample introduced by POE shows a similar representation to ID data, which is most effective in training a rejection network. Our method does not require any external OOD data and can be easily implemented within off-the-shelf Transformers. A comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrates POE's competitiveness on several text classification benchmarks. ",

This study focuses on monitoring students' emotions in the classroom as an indicator of their engagement and proposes an approach to address this issue. The impact of different facial parts on the performance of an emotional recognition model is evaluated through experimentation. To test the proposed model under partial occlusion, an artificially occluded dataset is introduced. The novelty of this work lies in the proposal of an occlusion-aware architecture for facial action units (AUs) extraction, which employs attention mechanism and adaptive feature learning. The AUs can be used later to classify facial expressions in classroom settings. This research paper's findings provide valuable insights into handling occlusion in analyzing facial images for emotional engagement analysis. The proposed experiments demonstrate the significance of considering occlusion and enhancing the reliability of facial analysis models in classroom environments. These findings can also be extended to other settings where occlusions are prevalent. ",

In this work, we propose a simple, fast, and end-to-end detector that still maintains high detection precision. Specifically, we devise a set of fully convolutional heads based on row-wise classification. In contrast to previous counterparts, ours supports recognizing both vertical and horizontal lanes. Besides, our method is the first one to perform row-wise classification in bird-eye-view. In the heads, we split feature into multiple groups and every group of feature corresponds to a lane instance. During training, the predictions are associated with lane labels using the proposed single-win one-to-one matching to compute loss, and no post-processing operation is demanded for inference. In this way, our proposed fully convolutional detector, GroupLane, realizes end-to-end detection like DETR. Evaluated on 3 real world 3D lane benchmarks, OpenLane, Once-3DLanes, and OpenLane-Huawei, GroupLane adopting ConvNext-Base as the backbone outperforms the published state-of-the-art PersFormer by 13.6% F1 score in the OpenLane validation set. Besides, GroupLane with ResNet18 still surpasses PersFormer by 4.9% F1 score, while the inference speed is nearly 7x faster and the FLOPs is only 13.3% of it. ",

We know that testing the planarity of a graph and computing its embedding (if it exists), can efficiently be computed, both sequentially [HT] and in parallel [RR94], when the entire graph is presented as input. In the dynamic setting, the input graph changes one edge at a time through insertion and deletions and planarity testing/embedding has to be updated after every change. By storing auxilliary information we can improve the complexity of dynamic planarity testing/embedding over the obvious recomputation from scratch. In the sequential dynamic setting, there has been a series of works [EGIS, IPR, HIKLR, HR1], culminating in the breakthrough result of polylog(n) sequential time (amortized) planarity testing algorithm of Holm and Rotenberg [HR2]. In this paper, we study planar embedding through the lens of DynFO, a parallel dynamic complexity class introduced by Patnaik et al. [PI] (also [DST95]). We show that it is possible to dynamically maintain whether an edge can be inserted to a planar graph without causing non-planarity in DynFO. We extend this to show how to maintain an embedding of a planar graph under both edge insertions and deletions, while rejecting edge insertions that violate planarity. Our main idea is to maintain embeddings of only the triconnected components and a special two-colouring of separating pairs that enables us to side-step cascading flips when embedding of a biconnected planar graph changes, a major issue for sequential dynamic algorithms [HR1, HR2].

Our results show that the parallel hybrid model outperforms standalone classical and quantum models, achieving more than 5.7 and 4.9 times lower mean squared error (MSE) loss on the test set after training compared to pure classical and pure quantum networks, respectively. Furthermore, the hybrid model demonstrates smaller relative errors between the ground truth and the model predictions on the test set, up to 2 times better than the pure classical model.

    "abstract": "Fourier phase retrieval (FPR) is a challenging task widely used in various applications. It involves recovering an unknown signal from its Fourier phaseless measurements. FPR with few measurements is important for reducing time and hardware costs, but it suffers from serious ill-posedness. Recently, untrained neural networks have offered new approaches by introducing learned priors to alleviate the ill-posedness without requiring any external data. However, they may not be ideal for reconstructing fine details in images and can be computationally expensive. This paper proposes an untrained neural network (NN) embedded algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework to solve FPR with few measurements. Specifically, we use a generative network to represent the image to be recovered, which confines the image to the space defined by the network structure. To improve the ability to represent high-frequency information, total variation (TV) regularization is imposed to facilitate the recovery of local structures in the image. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost mainly caused by the parameter updates of the untrained NN, we develop an accelerated algorithm that adaptively trades off between explicit and implicit regularization. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing untrained NN-based algorithms with fewer computational resources and even performs competitively against trained NN-based algorithms.

At the heart of this revolutionary technology are quantum circuits, which serve as vital tools for implementing, analyzing, and optimizing quantum algorithms. Recent advancements in quantum computing and the increasing capability of quantum devices have led to the development of more complex quantum circuits. However, traditional quantum circuit diagrams suffer from scalability and readability issues, which limit the efficiency of analysis and optimization processes. In this research, we propose a novel visualization approach for large-scale quantum circuits by adopting semantic analysis to facilitate the comprehension of quantum circuits. We first exploit meta-data and semantic information extracted from the underlying code of quantum circuits to create component segmentations and pattern abstractions, allowing for easier wrangling of massive circuit diagrams. We then develop Quantivine, an interactive system for exploring and understanding quantum circuits. A series of novel circuit visualizations are designed to uncover contextual details such as qubit provenance, parallelism, and entanglement. The effectiveness of Quantivine is demonstrated through two usage scenarios of quantum circuits with up to 100 qubits and a formal user evaluation with quantum experts.

It is motivated by the recently proposed tensor-tensor product induced by invertible linear transforms that satisfy certain conditions. For tensor observations with arbitrary outlier corruptions, OR-TLRR has provable performance guarantee for exactly recovering the row space of clean data and detecting outliers under mild conditions. Moreover, an extension of OR-TLRR is also proposed to handle the case when parts of the data are missing.

Specifically, it is important to know how far information can potentially be transferred between nodes of the quantum networks modelled by integral circulant graphs and this task is related to calculating the maximal diameter of a graph. The integral circulant graph $ICG_n (D)$ has the vertex set $Z_n = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n - 1\\}$ and vertices $a$ and $b$ are adjacent if $\\gcd(a-b,n)\\in D$, where $D \\subseteq \\{d : d \\mid n,\\ 1\\leq d<n\\}$. Motivated by the result on the upper bound of the diameter of $ICG_n(D)$ given in [N. Saxena, S. Severini, I. Shparlinski, \\textit{Parameters of integral circulant graphs and periodic quantum dynamics}, International Journal of Quantum Information 5 (2007), 417--430], according to which $2|D|+1$ represents one such bound, in this paper we prove that the maximal value of the diameter of the integral circulant graph $ICG_n(D)$ of a given order $n$ with its prime factorization $p_1^{\\alpha_1}\\cdots p_k^{\\alpha_k}$, is equal to $r(n)$ or $r(n)+1$, where $r(n)=k + |\\{ i \\ | \\alpha_i> 1,\\ 1\\leq i\\leq k \\}|$, depending on whether $n\\not\\in 4N+2$ or not, respectively. Furthermore, we show that, for a given order $n$, a divisor set $D$ with $|D|\\leq k$ can always be found such that this bound is attained. Finally, we calculate the maximal diameter in the class of integral circulant graphs of a given order $n$ and cardinality of the divisor set $t\\leq k$ and characterize all extremal graphs. We actually show that the maximal diameter can have the values $2t$, $2t+1$, $r(n)$ and $r(n)+1$ depending on the values of $t$ and $n$. This way we further improve the upper bound of Saxena, Severini and Shparlinski and we also characterize all graphs whose diameters are equal to $2|D|+1$, thus generalizing a result in that paper. ",

Molecular dynamics has enabled the efficient collection of large peptide datasets, providing reliable training data for deep learning. However, the lack of systematic analysis of the peptide encoding, which is essential for AI-assisted peptide-related tasks, makes it an urgent problem to be solved for the improvement of prediction accuracy. To address this issue, we first collect a high-quality, colossal simulation dataset of peptide self-assembly containing over 62,000 samples generated by coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD). Then, we systematically investigate the effect of peptide encoding of amino acids into sequences and molecular graphs using state-of-the-art sequential (i.e., RNN, LSTM, and Transformer) and structural deep learning models (i.e., GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE), on the accuracy of peptide self-assembly prediction, an essential physiochemical process prior to any peptide-related applications. Extensive benchmarking studies have proven Transformer to be the most powerful sequence-encoding-based deep learning model, pushing the limit of peptide self-assembly prediction to decapeptides. In summary, this work provides a comprehensive benchmark analysis of peptide encoding with advanced deep learning models, serving as a guide for a wide range of peptide-related predictions such as isoelectric points, hydration free energy, etc. ",

    "abstract": "Microseismic event detection and location are two primary components in microseismic monitoring, which offers us invaluable insights into the subsurface during reservoir stimulation and evolution. Conventional approaches for event detection and location often suffer from manual intervention and/or heavy computation, while current machine learning-assisted approaches typically address detection and location separately; such limitations hinder the potential for real-time microseismic monitoring. We propose an approach to unify event detection and source location into a single framework by adapting a Convolutional Neural Network backbone and an encoder-decoder Transformer with a set-based Hungarian loss, which is applied directly to recorded waveforms. The proposed network is trained on synthetic data simulating multiple microseismic events corresponding to random source locations in the area of suspected microseismic activities. A synthetic test on a 2D profile of the SEAM Time Lapse model illustrates the capability of the proposed method in detecting the events properly and locating them in the subsurface accurately; while, a field test using the Arkoma Basin data further proves its practicability, efficiency, and its potential in paving the way for real-time monitoring of microseismic events.

    "abstract": "We introduce the nested stochastic block model (NSBM) to cluster a collection of networks while simultaneously detecting communities within each network. NSBM has several appealing features including the ability to work on unlabeled networks with potentially different node sets, the flexibility to model heterogeneous communities, and the means to automatically select the number of classes for the networks and the number of communities within each network. This is accomplished via a Bayesian model, with a novel application of the nested Dirichlet process (NDP) as a prior to jointly model the between-network and within-network clusters. The dependency introduced by the network data creates nontrivial challenges for the NDP, especially in the development of efficient samplers. For posterior inference, we propose several Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms including a standard Gibbs sampler, a collapsed Gibbs sampler, and two blocked Gibbs samplers that ultimately return two levels of clustering labels from both within and across the networks. Extensive simulation studies are carried out which demonstrate that the model provides very accurate estimates of both levels of the clustering structure. We also apply our model to two social network datasets that cannot be analyzed using any previous method in the literature due to the anonymity of the nodes and the varying number of nodes in each network.

    "abstract": "Deep feedforward and recurrent rate-based neural networks have become successful functional models of the brain, but they neglect obvious biological details such as spikes and Dale's law. Here we argue that these details are crucial in order to understand how real neural circuits operate. Towards this aim, we put forth a new framework for spike-based computation in low-rank excitatory-inhibitory spiking networks. By considering populations with rank-1 connectivity, we cast each neuron's spiking threshold as a boundary in a low-dimensional input-output space. We then show how the combined thresholds of a population of inhibitory neurons form a stable boundary in this space, and those of a population of excitatory neurons form an unstable boundary. Combining the two boundaries results in a rank-2 excitatory-inhibitory (EI) network with inhibition-stabilized dynamics at the intersection of the two boundaries. The computation of the resulting networks can be understood as the difference of two convex functions, and is thereby capable of approximating arbitrary non-linear input-output mappings. We demonstrate several properties of these networks, including noise suppression and amplification, irregular activity and synaptic balance, as well as how they relate to rate network dynamics in the limit that the boundary becomes soft. Finally, while our work focuses on small networks (5-50 neurons), we discuss potential avenues for scaling up to much larger networks. Overall, our work proposes a new perspective on spiking networks that may serve as a starting point for a mechanistic understanding of biological spike-based computation. ",

    "abstract": "Obtaining accurate solutions to the Schr\\\"odinger equation is the key challenge in computational quantum chemistry. Deep-learning-based Variational Monte Carlo (DL-VMC) has recently outperformed conventional approaches in terms of accuracy, but only at large computational cost. Whereas in many domains models are trained once and subsequently applied for inference, accurate DL-VMC so far requires a full optimization for every new problem instance, consuming thousands of GPUhs even for small molecules. We instead propose a DL-VMC model which has been pre-trained using self-supervised wavefunction optimization on a large and chemically diverse set of molecules. Applying this model to new molecules without any optimization, yields wavefunctions and absolute energies that outperform established methods such as CCSD(T)-2Z. To obtain accurate relative energies, only few fine-tuning steps of this base model are required. We accomplish this with a fully end-to-end machine-learned model, consisting of an improved geometry embedding architecture and an existing SE(3)-equivariant model to represent molecular orbitals. Combining this architecture with continuous sampling of geometries, we improve zero-shot accuracy by two orders of magnitude compared to the state of the art. We extensively evaluate the accuracy, scalability and limitations of our base model on a wide variety of test systems. ",

    "abstract": "Utilizing spherical harmonic (SH) domain has been established as the default method of obtaining continuity over space in head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). This paper concerns different variants of extending this solution by replacing SHs with four-dimensional (4D) continuous functional models in which frequency is imagined as another physical dimension. Recently developed hyperspherical harmonic (HSH) representation is compared with models defined in spherindrical coordinate system by merging SHs with one-dimensional basis functions. The efficiency of both approaches is evaluated based on the reproduction errors for individual HRTFs from HUTUBS database, including detailed analysis of its dependency on chosen orders of approximation in frequency and space. Employing continuous functional models defined in 4D coordinate systems allows HRTF magnitude spectra to be expressed as a small set of coefficients which can be decoded back into values at any direction and frequency. The best performance was noted for HSHs and SHs merged with reverse Fourier-Bessel series, with the former featuring better compression abilities, achieving slightly higher accuracy for low number of coefficients. The presented models can serve multiple purposes, such as interpolation, compression or parametrization for machine learning applications, and can be applied not only to HRTFs but also to other types of directivity functions, e.g. sound source directivity.

In this work, we explored the recent state-of-art transformer models to detect Covid-19 using CXR images such as vision transformer (ViT), Swin-transformer, Max vision transformer (MViT), and Pyramid Vision transformer (PVT). Through the utilization of transfer learning with IMAGENET weights, the models achieved an impressive accuracy range of 98.75% to 99.5%. Our experiments demonstrate that Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art performance in COVID-19 detection, outperforming traditional methods and even Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The results highlight the potential of Vision Transformers as a powerful tool for COVID-19 detection, with implications for improving the efficiency and accuracy of screening and diagnosis in clinical settings.

Traditional MIL assumes that instances in each bag are independent samples from a given distribution. However, instances are often spatially or sequentially ordered, and one would expect similar diagnostic importance for neighboring instances. To address this, in this study, we propose a smooth attention deep MIL (SA-DMIL) model. Smoothness is achieved by the introduction of first and second order constraints on the latent function encoding the attention paid to each instance in a bag. The method is applied to the detection of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on head CT scans. The results show that this novel SA-DMIL: (a) achieves better performance than the non-smooth attention MIL at both scan (bag) and slice (instance) levels; (b) learns spatial dependencies between slices; and (c) outperforms current state-of-the-art MIL methods on the same ICH test set.

    "abstract": "Neural decoders for quantum error correction (QEC) rely on neural networks to classify syndromes extracted from error correction codes and find appropriate recovery operators to protect logical information against errors. Despite the good performance of neural decoders, important practical requirements remain to be achieved, such as minimizing the decoding time to meet typical rates of syndrome generation in repeated error correction schemes, and ensuring the scalability of the decoding approach as the code distance increases. Designing a dedicated integrated circuit to perform the decoding task in co-integration with a quantum processor appears necessary to reach these decoding time and scalability requirements, as routing signals in and out of a cryogenic environment to be processed externally leads to unnecessary delays and an eventual wiring bottleneck. In this work, we report the design and performance analysis of a neural decoder inference accelerator based on an in-memory computing (IMC) architecture, where crossbar arrays of resistive memory devices are employed to both store the synaptic weights of the decoder neural network and perform analog matrix-vector multiplications during inference. In proof-of-concept numerical experiments supported by experimental measurements, we investigate the impact of TiO$_\\textrm{x}$-based memristive devices' non-idealities on decoding accuracy. Hardware-aware training methods are developed to mitigate the loss in accuracy, allowing the memristive neural decoders to achieve a pseudo-threshold of $9.23\\times 10^{-4}$ for the distance-three surface code, whereas the equivalent digital neural decoder achieves a pseudo-threshold of $1.01\\times 10^{-3}$. This work provides a pathway to scalable, fast, and low-power cryogenic IMC hardware for integrated QEC. ",
