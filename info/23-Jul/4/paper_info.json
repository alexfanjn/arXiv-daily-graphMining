    "abstract": "Flaky tests are problematic because they non-deterministically pass or fail for the same software version under test, causing confusion and wasting developer time. While machine learning models have been used to predict flakiness and its root causes, there is less work on providing support to fix the problem. To address this gap, we propose a framework that automatically generates labeled datasets for 13 fix categories and train models to predict the fix category of a flaky test by analyzing the test code only. Though it is unrealistic at this stage to accurately predict the fix itself, the categories provide precise guidance about what part of the test code to look at. Our approach is based on language models, namely CodeBERT and UniXcoder, whose output is fine-tuned with a Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN) or a Siamese Network-based Few Shot Learning (FSL). Our experimental results show that UniXcoder outperforms CodeBERT, in correctly predicting most of the categories of fixes a developer should apply. Furthermore, FSL does not appear to have any significant effect. Given the high accuracy obtained for most fix categories, our proposed framework has the potential to help developers to fix flaky tests quickly and accurately.To aid future research, we make our automated labeling tool, dataset, prediction models, and experimental infrastructure publicly available.

Existing neural ray fields struggle with multi-view consistency and representing surface discontinuities. MARFs address both using a medial shape representation, a dual representation of solid geometry that yields cheap geometrically grounded surface normals, in turn enabling computing analytical curvature despite the network having no second derivative. MARFs map a camera ray to multiple medial intersection candidates, subject to ray-sphere intersection testing. We illustrate how the learned medial shape quantities applies to sub-surface scattering, part segmentation, and aid representing a space of articulated shapes. Able to learn a space of shape priors, MARFs may prove useful for tasks like shape retrieval and shape completion, among others. Code and data can be found at https://github.com/pbsds/MARF. ",

In this paper, we present and benchmark three new approaches to model and predict multi-agent interactions in dense scenes, including the use of an intuitive qualitative representation. The proposed solutions take into account static and dynamic context to predict individual interactions. They exploit an input- and a temporal-attention mechanism, and are tested on medium and long-term time horizons. The first two approaches integrate different relations from the so-called Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC) within a state-of-the-art deep neural network to create a symbol-driven neural architecture for predicting spatial interactions. The third approach implements a purely data-driven network for motion prediction, the output of which is post-processed to predict QTC spatial interactions. Experimental results on a popular robot dataset of challenging crowded scenarios show that the purely data-driven prediction approach generally outperforms the other two. The three approaches were further evaluated on a different but related human scenarios to assess their generalisation capability. ",

    "abstract": "Recent efforts in fake news detection have witnessed a surge of interest in using graph neural networks (GNNs) to exploit rich social context. Existing studies generally leverage fixed graph structures, assuming that the graphs accurately represent the related social engagements. However, edge noise remains a critical challenge in real-world graphs, as training on suboptimal structures can severely limit the expressiveness of GNNs. Despite initial efforts in graph structure learning (GSL), prior works often leverage node features to update edge weights, resulting in heavy computational costs that hinder the methods' applicability to large-scale social graphs. In this work, we approach the fake news detection problem with a novel aspect of social graph refinement. We find that the degrees of news article nodes exhibit distinctive patterns, which are indicative of news veracity. Guided by this, we propose DECOR, a novel application of Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodels to the fake news detection problem. Specifically, we encapsulate our empirical observations into a lightweight social graph refinement component that iteratively updates the edge weights via a learnable degree correction mask, which allows for joint optimization with a GNN-based detector. Extensive experiments on two real-world benchmarks validate the effectiveness and efficiency of DECOR. ",

We propose a novel methodology that employs semantic segmentation based on the temporal analysis of smoke patterns in video sequences. Our approach utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture based on deep convolutional neural network architecture with a pre-trained CNN encoder and 3D convolutions for decoding while using sequential stacking of features to exploit temporal variations. The predicted fire locations can assist drones in effectively combating forest fires and pinpoint fire retardant chemical drop on exact flame locations. We applied our method to a curated dataset derived from the FLAME2 dataset that includes RGB video along with IR video to determine the ground truth. Our proposed method has a unique property of detecting obscured fire and achieves a Dice score of 85.88%, while achieving a high precision of 92.47% and classification accuracy of 90.67% on test data showing promising results when inspected visually. Indeed, our method outperforms other methods by a significant margin in terms of video-level fire classification as we obtained about 100% accuracy using MobileNet+CBAM as the encoder backbone. ",

They are usually based on a message-passing mechanism and have gained increasing popularity for their intuitive formulation, which is closely linked to the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test for graph isomorphism to which they have been proven equivalent in terms of expressive power. In this work, we establish new generalization properties and fundamental limits of GNNs in the context of learning so-called identity effects, i.e., the task of determining whether an object is composed of two identical components or not. Our study is motivated by the need to understand the capabilities of GNNs when performing simple cognitive tasks, with potential applications in computational linguistics and chemistry. We analyze two case studies: (i) two-letters words, for which we show that GNNs trained via stochastic gradient descent are unable to generalize to unseen letters when utilizing orthogonal encodings like one-hot representations; (ii) dicyclic graphs, i.e., graphs composed of two cycles, for which we present positive existence results leveraging the connection between GNNs and the WL test.

    "abstract": "Many self-supervised speech models (S3Ms) have been introduced over the last few years, producing performance and data efficiency improvements for a variety of speech tasks. Evidence is emerging that different S3Ms encode linguistic information in different layers, and also that some S3Ms appear to learn phone-like sub-word units. However, the extent to which these models capture larger linguistic units, such as words, and where word-related information is encoded, remains unclear. In this study, we conduct several analyses of word segment representations extracted from different layers of three S3Ms: wav2vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM. We employ canonical correlation analysis (CCA), a lightweight analysis tool, to measure the similarity between these representations and word-level linguistic properties. We find that the maximal word-level linguistic content tends to be found in intermediate model layers, while some lower-level information like pronunciation is also retained in higher layers of HuBERT and WavLM. Syntactic and semantic word attributes have similar layer-wise behavior. We also find that, for all of the models tested, word identity information is concentrated near the center of each word segment. We then test the layer-wise performance of the same models, when used directly with no additional learned parameters, on several tasks: acoustic word discrimination, word segmentation, and semantic sentence similarity. We find similar layer-wise trends in performance, and furthermore, find that when using the best-performing layer of HuBERT or WavLM, it is possible to achieve performance on word segmentation and sentence similarity that rivals more complex existing approaches.

    "abstract": "Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications employ narrow-beam directional communications to compensate for the high path loss at mmWave frequencies. Compared to their omnidirectional counterparts, an additional step of aligning the transmitter's and receiver's antennas is required. In current standards such as 802.11ad, this beam alignment process is implemented via an exhaustive search through the horizontal plane known as beam sweeping. However, the beam sweeping process is unauthenticated. As a result, an adversary, Mallory, can launch an active beam-stealing attack by injecting forged beacons of high power, forcing the legitimate devices to beamform towards her direction. Mallory is now in control of the communication link between the two devices, thus breaking the false sense of security given by the directionality of mmWave transmissions. Prior works have added integrity protection to beam alignment messages to prevent forgeries. In this paper, we demonstrate a new beam-stealing attack that does not require message forging. We show that Mallory can amplify and relay a beam sweeping frame from her direction without altering its contents. Intuitively, cryptographic primitives cannot verify physical properties such as the SNR used in beam selection. We propose a new beam sweeping protocol called SecBeam that utilizes power/sector randomization and coarse angle-of-arrival information to detect amplify-and-relay attacks. We demonstrate the security and performance of SecBeam using an experimental mmWave platform and via ray-tracing simulations. ",

    "abstract": "Incremental random weight neural networks (IRWNNs) have gained attention in view of its easy implementation and fast learning. However, a significant drawback of IRWNNs is that the elationship between the hidden parameters (node)and the residual error (model performance) is difficult to be interpreted. To address the above issue, this article proposes an interpretable constructive algorithm (ICA) with geometric information constraint. First, based on the geometric relationship between the hidden parameters and the residual error, an interpretable geometric information constraint is proposed to randomly assign the hidden parameters. Meanwhile, a node pool strategy is employed to obtain hidden parameters that is more conducive to convergence from hidden parameters satisfying the proposed constraint. Furthermore, the universal approximation property of the ICA is proved. Finally, a lightweight version of ICA is presented for large-scale data modeling tasks. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets and a numerical simulation dataset demonstrate that the ICA outperforms other constructive algorithms in terms of modeling speed, model accuracy, and model network structure. Besides, two practical industrial application case are used to validate the effectiveness of ICA in practical applications. ",

A hybrid of transformers and convolutional layers, CCTs demonstrate high accuracy on modestly sized datasets. We employed a benchmark dataset of peripheral blood cell images of eight distinct cell types, each represented by approximately 2,000 low-resolution (28x28x3 pixel) samples. Despite the dataset size being smaller than those typically used with Vision Transformers, we achieved a commendable classification accuracy of 92.49% and a micro-average ROC AUC of 0.9935. The CCT also learned quickly, exceeding 80% validation accuracy after five epochs. Analysis of per-class precision, recall, F1, and ROC showed that performance was strong across cell types. Our findings underscore the robustness of CCTs, indicating their potential as a solution to data scarcity issues prevalent in biomedical imaging.

However, the locality assumption of GNNs, which limits information exchange to neighboring nodes, hampers their ability to capture long-range dependencies and global patterns in graphs. To address this, we propose a new inductive bias based on variational analysis, drawing inspiration from the Brachistochrone problem. Our framework establishes a mapping between discrete GNN models and continuous diffusion functionals. This enables the design of application-specific objective functions in the continuous domain and the construction of discrete deep models with mathematical guarantees. To tackle over-smoothing in GNNs, we analyze the existing layer-by-layer graph embedding models and identify that they are equivalent to l2-norm integral functionals of graph gradients, which cause over-smoothing. Similar to edge-preserving filters in image denoising, we introduce total variation (TV) to align the graph diffusion pattern with global community topologies. Additionally, we devise a selective mechanism to address the trade-off between model depth and over-smoothing, which can be easily integrated into existing GNNs. Furthermore, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) that predicts spreading flows in graphs through a neural transport equation. To mitigate vanishing flows, we customize the objective function to minimize transportation within each community while maximizing inter-community flows.

To address the above challenges, we propose a scalable system named InferTurbo to boost the GNN inference tasks in industrial scenarios. Inspired by the philosophy of ``think-like-a-vertex\", a GAS-like (Gather-Apply-Scatter) schema is proposed to describe the computation paradigm and data flow of GNN inference. The computation of GNNs is expressed in an iteration manner, in which a vertex would gather messages via in-edges and update its state information by forwarding an associated layer of GNNs with those messages and then send the updated information to other vertexes via out-edges. Following the schema, the proposed InferTurbo can be built with alternative backends (e.g., batch processing system or graph computing system). Moreover, InferTurbo introduces several strategies like shadow-nodes and partial-gather to handle nodes with large degrees for better load balancing. With InferTurbo, GNN inference can be hierarchically conducted over the full graph without sampling and redundant computation. Experimental results demonstrate that our system is robust and efficient for inference tasks over graphs containing some hub nodes with many adjacent edges. Meanwhile, the system gains a remarkable performance compared with the traditional inference pipeline, and it can finish a GNN inference task over a graph with tens of billions of nodes and hundreds of billions of edges within 2 hours.

We address this gap by conducting a first-of-its-kind extensive measurement campaign of a dense indoor Wi-Fi 6E network at the University of Michigan. The campaign includes walking, driving, and drone measurements to assess outdoor beacon Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), building entry loss (BEL), channel utilization, and appropriate enabling signal level for a proposed client-to-client (C2C) mode in 6 GHz. Our detailed measurements under various conditions show median outdoor RSSI between -75 dBm and -85 dBm, BEL between 12 dB and 16 dB through double-pane low-emission windows, and only 5% of indoor Basic Service Set Identifiers (BSSIDs) observed outdoors. Our overall conclusion is that the probability of interference to incumbent fixed links is low, but more research is required to determine the appropriate signal level for the C2C enabling signal. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the absence of a single standardized imaging protocol, domain shift between data acquired from different sites is an inherent property of medical images and has become a major obstacle for large-scale deployment of learning-based algorithms. For retinal vessel images, domain shift usually presents as the variation of intensity, contrast and resolution, while the basic tubular shape of vessels remains unaffected. Thus, taking advantage of such domain-invariant morphological features can greatly improve the generalizability of deep models. In this study, we propose a method named VesselMorph which generalizes the 2D retinal vessel segmentation task by synthesizing a shape-aware representation. Inspired by the traditional Frangi filter and the diffusion tensor imaging literature, we introduce a Hessian-based bipolar tensor field to depict the morphology of the vessels so that the shape information is taken into account. We map the intensity image and the tensor field to a latent space for feature extraction. Then we fuse the two latent representations via a weight-balancing trick and feed the result to a segmentation network. We evaluate on six public datasets of fundus and OCT angiography images from diverse patient populations. VesselMorph achieves superior generalization performance compared with competing methods in different domain shift scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Automatic query reformulation is a widely utilized technology for enriching user requirements and enhancing the outcomes of code search. It can be conceptualized as a machine translation task, wherein the objective is to rephrase a given query into a more comprehensive alternative. While showing promising results, training such a model typically requires a large parallel corpus of query pairs (i.e., the original query and a reformulated query) that are confidential and unpublished by online code search engines. This restricts its practicality in software development processes. In this paper, we propose SSQR, a self-supervised query reformulation method that does not rely on any parallel query corpus. Inspired by pre-trained models, SSQR treats query reformulation as a masked language modeling task conducted on an extensive unannotated corpus of queries. SSQR extends T5 (a sequence-to-sequence model based on Transformer) with a new pre-training objective named corrupted query completion (CQC), which randomly masks words within a complete query and trains T5 to predict the masked content. Subsequently, for a given query to be reformulated, SSQR identifies potential locations for expansion and leverages the pre-trained T5 model to generate appropriate content to fill these gaps. The selection of expansions is then based on the information gain associated with each candidate. Evaluation results demonstrate that SSQR outperforms unsupervised baselines significantly and achieves competitive performance compared to supervised methods. ",

Nevertheless, we argue that the noise introduced by DP mechanisms may inadvertently give rise to a novel poisoning threat, specifically in the context of private knowledge sharing during CMARL, which remains unexplored in the literature. To address this shortcoming, we present an adaptive, privacy-exploiting, and evasion-resilient localized poisoning attack (PeLPA) that capitalizes on the inherent DP-noise to circumvent anomaly detection systems and hinder the optimal convergence of the CMARL model. We rigorously evaluate our proposed PeLPA attack in diverse environments, encompassing both non-adversarial and multiple-adversarial contexts. Our findings reveal that, in a medium-scale environment, the PeLPA attack with attacker ratios of 20% and 40% can lead to an increase in average steps to goal by 50.69% and 64.41%, respectively. Furthermore, under similar conditions, PeLPA can result in a 1.4x and 1.6x computational time increase in optimal reward attainment and a 1.18x and 1.38x slower convergence for attacker ratios of 20% and 40%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Through extensive research on deep learning in recent years and its application in construction, crack detection has evolved rapidly from rough detection at the image-level and patch-level to fine-grained detection at the pixel-level, which better suits the nature of this field. Despite numerous existing studies utilizing off-the-shelf deep learning models or enhancing them, these models are not always effective or efficient in real-world applications. In order to bridge this gap, we propose a High-resolution model with Semantic guidance, specifically designed for real-time crack segmentation, referred to as HrSegNet. Our model maintains high resolution throughout the entire process, as opposed to recovering from low-resolution features to high-resolution ones, thereby maximizing the preservation of crack details. Moreover, to enhance the context information, we use low-resolution semantic features to guide the reconstruction of high-resolution features. To ensure the efficiency of the algorithm, we design a simple yet effective method to control the computation cost of the entire model by controlling the capacity of high-resolution channels, while providing the model with extremely strong scalability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our proposed HrSegNet has exceptional crack segmentation capabilities, and that maintaining high resolution and semantic guidance are crucial to the final prediction. Compared to state-of-the-art segmentation models, HrSegNet achieves the best trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Specifically, on the crack dataset CrackSeg9k, our fastest model HrSegNet-B16 achieves a speed of 182 FPS with 78.43% mIoU, while our most accurate model HrSegNet-B48 achieves 80.32% mIoU with an inference speed of 140.3 FPS.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on an important type of black-box attacks, i.e., transfer-based adversarial attacks, where the adversary generates adversarial examples by a substitute (source) model and utilize them to attack an unseen target model, without knowing its information. Existing methods tend to give unsatisfactory adversarial transferability when the source and target models are from different types of DNN architectures (e.g. ResNet-18 and Swin Transformer). In this paper, we observe that the above phenomenon is induced by the output inconsistency problem. To alleviate this problem while effectively utilizing the existing DNN models, we propose a common knowledge learning (CKL) framework to learn better network weights to generate adversarial examples with better transferability, under fixed network architectures. Specifically, to reduce the model-specific features and obtain better output distributions, we construct a multi-teacher framework, where the knowledge is distilled from different teacher architectures into one student network. By considering that the gradient of input is usually utilized to generated adversarial examples, we impose constraints on the gradients between the student and teacher models, to further alleviate the output inconsistency problem and enhance the adversarial transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed work can significantly improve the adversarial transferability. ",

    "abstract": "Spiking Transformers have gained considerable attention because they achieve both the energy efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and the high capacity of Transformers. However, the existing Spiking Transformer architectures, derived from ANNs, exhibit a notable architectural gap, resulting in suboptimal performance compared to their ANN counterparts. Traditional approaches to discovering optimal architectures primarily rely on either manual procedures, which are time-consuming, or Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which are usually expensive in terms of memory footprints and computation time. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoST, a training-free NAS method for Spiking Transformers, to rapidly identify high-performance and energy-efficient Spiking Transformer architectures. Unlike existing training-free NAS methods, which struggle with the non-differentiability and high sparsity inherent in SNNs, we propose to utilize Floating-Point Operations (FLOPs) as a performance metric, which is independent of model computations and training dynamics, leading to a stronger correlation with performance. Moreover, to enable the search for energy-efficient architectures, we leverage activation patterns during initialization to estimate the energy consumption of Spiking Transformers. Our extensive experiments show that AutoST models outperform state-of-the-art manually or automatically designed SNN architectures on static and neuromorphic datasets, while significantly reducing energy consumption.

This paper demonstrates a novel application of Bayesian techniques to real-world inclinometer data, providing both anomaly detection and forecasting. Specifically, this paper details an analysis of data collected from inclinometer data across the entire UK rail network. Practitioners have effectively two goals when processing monitoring data. The first is to identify any anomalous or dangerous movements, and the second is to predict potential future adverse scenarios by forecasting. In this paper we apply Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques by implementing a Bayesian approach to anomaly detection and forecasting for inclinometer data. Subsequently, both costs and risks may be minimised by quantifying and evaluating the appropriate uncertainties. This framework may then act as an enabler for enhanced decision making and risk analysis. We show that inclinometer data can be described by a latent autocorrelated Markov process derived from measurements. This can be used as the transition model of a non-linear Bayesian filter. This allows for the prediction of system states. This learnt latent model also allows for the detection of anomalies: observations that are far from their expected value may be considered to have `high surprisal', that is they have a high information content relative to the model encoding represented by the learnt latent model. We successfully apply the forecasting and anomaly detection techniques to a large real-world data set in a computationally efficient manner. Although this paper studies inclinometers in particular, the techniques are broadly applicable to all areas of engineering UQ and Structural Health Monitoring (SHM). ",

PDM comprehensively leverages the prompt memory to extract domain-specific knowledge and explicitly constructs a long-term memory space for the data distribution, which represents better domain diversity compared to existing methods. Specifically, each prompt and its corresponding distribution value are paired in the memory space, and we inject top M distribution-similar prompts into the input and multi-level embeddings of DETR. Additionally, we introduce the Prompt Memory Alignment (PMA) to reduce the discrepancy between the source and target domains by fully leveraging the domain-specific knowledge extracted from the prompt domain memory.

Detection of potential river sandbank regions for sand mining directly impacts the economy, society, and environment. In the past, semi-supervised and supervised techniques have been used to detect mining regions including sand mining. A few techniques employ multi-modal analysis combining different modalities such as multi-spectral imaging, synthetic aperture radar (\\emph{SAR}) imaging, aerial images, and point cloud data. However, the distinguishing spectral characteristics of river sandbank regions are yet to be fully explored. This paper provides a novel method to detect river sandbank regions for sand mining using multi-spectral images without any labeled data over the seasons. Association with a river stream and the abundance of minerals are the most prominent features of such a region. The proposed work uses these distinguishing features to determine the spectral signature of a river sandbank region, which is robust to other high mineral abundance regions. It follows a two-step approach, where first, potential high mineral regions are detected and next, they are segregated using the presence of a river stream. The proposed technique provides average accuracy, precision, and recall of 90.75%, 85.47%, and 73.5%, respectively over the seasons from Landsat 8 images without using any labeled dataset. ",

However, its potential in the domain of multi-frame 3D object detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present STEMD, a novel end-to-end framework for multi-frame 3D object detection based on the DETR-like paradigm. Our approach treats multi-frame 3D object detection as a sequence-to-sequence task and effectively captures spatial-temporal dependencies at both the feature and query levels. To model the inter-object spatial interaction and complex temporal dependencies, we introduce the spatial-temporal graph attention network. This network represents queries as nodes in a graph and enables effective modeling of object interactions within a social context. In addition, to solve the problem of missing hard cases in the proposed output of the encoder in the current frame, we incorporate the output of the previous frame to initialize the query input of the decoder. Moreover, we tackle the issue of redundant detection results, where the model generates numerous overlapping boxes from similar queries. To mitigate this, we introduce an IoU regularization term in the loss function. This term aids in distinguishing between queries matched with the ground-truth box and queries that are similar but unmatched during the refinement process, leading to reduced redundancy and more accurate detections. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling challenging scenarios, while incurring only a minor additional computational overhead.

However, adversaries can manipulate datasets and upload models by injecting triggers for federated backdoor attacks (FBA). Existing defense strategies against FBA consider specific and limited attacker models, and a sufficient amount of noise to be injected only mitigates rather than eliminates FBA. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a Flexible Federated Backdoor Defense Framework (Fedward) to ensure the elimination of adversarial backdoors. We decompose FBA into various attacks, and design amplified magnitude sparsification (AmGrad) and adaptive OPTICS clustering (AutoOPTICS) to address each attack.

This ensures that Fedward can maintain the performance for the Non-IID scenario. We conduct experimental evaluations over three benchmark datasets and thoroughly compare them to state-of-the-art studies.

This study seeks to address the demands of high-performance machine learning models with environmental sustainability, contributing to the emerging discourse on 'Green AI.' An extensive variety of machine learning algorithms, coupled with various Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) configurations, were meticulously evaluated. Our investigation encapsulated a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics, comprising Accuracy, Area Under the Curve (AUC), Recall, Precision, F1 Score, Kappa Statistic, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and F1 Macro. Simultaneously, the environmental footprint of these models was gauged through considerations of time duration, CO2 equivalent, and energy consumption during the training, cross-validation, and inference phases. Traditional machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Trees and Random Forests, demonstrate robust efficiency and performance. However, superior outcomes were obtained with optimised MLP configurations, albeit with a commensurate increase in resource consumption. The study incorporated a multi-objective optimisation approach, invoking Pareto optimality principles, to highlight the trade-offs between a model's performance and its environmental impact. The insights derived underscore the imperative of striking a balance between model performance, complexity, and environmental implications, thus offering valuable directions for future work in the development of environmentally conscious machine learning models for industrial applications.

Specifically, working in the bit-model of real computation, we consider the eventual inequality testing problem for real functions that are specified by homogeneous linear Cauchy problems with arbitrary real coefficients and initial values. In order to assign to this problem a well-defined computational complexity, we develop a natural notion of polynomial-time decidability of subsets of computable metric spaces which extends our recently introduced notion of maximal partial decidability. We show that eventual inequality of C-finite functions is polynomial-time decidable in this sense. ",

    "abstract": "The so-called ``New Space era'' has seen a disruptive change in the business models and manufacturing technologies of launch vehicle companies. However, limited consideration has been given to the benefits that innovation in control theory can bring; not only in terms of increasing the limits of performance but also reducing mission preparation or ``missionisation'' efforts. Moreover, there is a gap between the current state-of-practice that still relies on linear controls and other modern control techniques that could bring relevant improvements in launcher attitude control. Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) is a technique that basically `cancels' the nonlinearities of a class of nonlinear systems, allowing for a single linear control law to be applied without the need for gain-scheduling across different operational points. Incremental NDI (INDI) is a variation of NDI that generates incremental commands and employs acceleration feedback to reduce model dependency, making it easier to design, and results in being more robust in closed-loop. While INDI has been applied successfully to several aerospace applications, its applicability to launch vehicles has not yet been adequately investigated. The objective of this paper is therefore to introduce and raise awareness of the INDI method among the launcher guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) community, showcasing its implementation on a representative launch ascent application scenario which highlights INDI's strengths and challenges. We present a new, practical approach for stability analysis of INDI for attitude control, and compare INDI with scheduled PD controllers with- and without angular acceleration estimates. Results show that, while INDI controllers are generally more sensitive to sensor noise and actuator delay than linear controllers, their potential benefits outweigh these limitations in terms of robustness and performance.

    "abstract": "Clinical trials (CTs) often fail due to inadequate patient recruitment. This paper tackles the challenges of CT retrieval by presenting an approach that addresses the patient-to-trials paradigm. Our approach involves two key components in a pipeline-based model: (i) a data enrichment technique for enhancing both queries and documents during the first retrieval stage, and (ii) a novel re-ranking schema that uses a Transformer network in a setup adapted to this task by leveraging the structure of the CT documents. We use named entity recognition and negation detection in both patient description and the eligibility section of CTs. We further classify patient descriptions and CT eligibility criteria into current, past, and family medical conditions. This extracted information is used to boost the importance of disease and drug mentions in both query and index for lexical retrieval. Furthermore, we propose a two-step training schema for the Transformer network used to re-rank the results from the lexical retrieval. The first step focuses on matching patient information with the descriptive sections of trials, while the second step aims to determine eligibility by matching patient information with the criteria section. Our findings indicate that the inclusion criteria section of the CT has a great influence on the relevance score in lexical models, and that the enrichment techniques for queries and documents improve the retrieval of relevant trials. The re-ranking strategy, based on our training schema, consistently enhances CT retrieval and shows improved performance by 15\\% in terms of precision at retrieving eligible trials. The results of our experiments suggest the benefit of making use of extracted entities. Moreover, our proposed re-ranking schema shows promising effectiveness compared to larger neural models, even with limited training data. ",

While GANs have demonstrated tremendous successes in producing synthetic data samples that replicate the dynamics of the original datasets, the validity of the synthetic data and the underlying privacy concerns represent major challenges which are not sufficiently addressed. In this work, we design a cascaded tabular GAN framework (CasTGAN) for generating realistic tabular data with a specific focus on the validity of the output. In this context, validity refers to the the dependency between features that can be found in the real data, but is typically misrepresented by traditional generative models. Our key idea entails that employing a cascaded architecture in which a dedicated generator samples each feature, the synthetic output becomes more representative of the real data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model well captures the constraints and the correlations between the features of the real data, especially the high dimensional datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the risk of white-box privacy attacks on our model and subsequently show that applying some perturbations to the auxiliary learners in CasTGAN increases the overall robustness of our model against targeted attacks.

    "abstract": "In real-world dialogue systems, the ability to understand the user's emotions and interact anthropomorphically is of great significance. Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is one of the key ways to accomplish this goal and has attracted growing attention. How to model the context in a conversation is a central aspect and a major challenge of ERC tasks. Most existing approaches are generally unable to capture both global and local contextual information efficiently, and their network structures are too complex to design. For this reason, in this work, we propose a straightforward Dual-stream Recurrence-Attention Network (DualRAN) based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Multi-head ATtention network (MAT). The proposed model eschews the complex network structure of current methods and focuses on combining recurrence-based methods with attention-based methods. DualRAN is a dual-stream structure mainly consisting of local- and global-aware modules, modeling a conversation from distinct perspectives. To achieve the local-aware module, we extend the structure of RNN, thus enhancing the expressive capability of the network. In addition, we develop two single-stream network variants for DualRAN, i.e., SingleRANv1 and SingleRANv2. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used benchmark datasets, and the results reveal that the proposed model outshines all baselines. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. ",

HID devotes to detecting subjects, recognizing person-wise actions, and grouping people according to their interactive relations, in one model. First, based on the popular AVA dataset created for action detection, we establish a new HID benchmark, termed AVA-Interaction (AVA-I), by adding annotations on interactive relations in a frame-by-frame manner. AVA-I consists of 85,254 frames and 86,338 interactive groups, and each image includes up to 4 concurrent interactive groups. Second, we present a novel baseline approach SaMFormer for HID, containing a visual feature extractor, a split stage which leverages a Transformer-based model to decode action instances and interactive groups, and a merging stage which reconstructs the relationship between instances and groups. All SaMFormer components are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on AVA-I validate the superiority of SaMFormer over representative methods.

In this work, we first explore the decision-based patch attack. To enhance the attack efficiency, we model the patches using paired key-points and use targeted images as the initialization of patches, and parameter optimizations are all performed on the integer domain. Then, we propose a differential evolutionary algorithm named DevoPatch for query-efficient decision-based patch attacks. Experiments demonstrate that DevoPatch outperforms the state-of-the-art black-box patch attacks in terms of patch area and attack success rate within a given query budget on image classification and face verification. Additionally, we conduct the vulnerability evaluation of ViT and MLP on image classification in the decision-based patch attack setting for the first time. Using DevoPatch, we can evaluate the robustness of models to black-box patch attacks.

Existing protection works only slightly change the visual content of the face while maintaining the utility of identification, making it susceptible to the inference of the true identity by human vision. In this paper, we propose an identity hider that enables significant visual content change for human vision while preserving high identifiability for face recognizers. Firstly, the identity hider generates a virtual face with new visual content by manipulating the latent space in StyleGAN2. In particular, the virtual face has the same irrelevant attributes as the original face, e.g., pose and expression. Secondly, the visual content of the virtual face is transferred into the original face and then the background is replaced with the original one. In addition, the identity hider has strong transferability, which ensures an arbitrary face recognizer can achieve satisfactory accuracy. Adequate experiments show that the proposed identity hider achieves excellent performance on privacy protection and identifiability preservation. ",

To overcome these problems, stochastic configuration network (SCN) based cloud ensemble learning, called SCN-CEL, is developed in this work. Concretely, a cloud feature extraction method is first developed by using a backward cloud generator of normal cloud model to mine the uncertainty of fault information. Then, a cloud sampling method, which generates enough cloud droplets using bidirectional cloud generator, is proposed to extend the cloud feature samples. Finally, an ensemble model with SCNs is developed to comprehensively characterize the uncertainty of fault information and advance the generalization performance of fault diagnosis machine.

Most existing log anomaly detection methods take a log event count matrix or log event sequences as input, exploiting quantitative and/or sequential relationships between log events to detect anomalies. Unfortunately, only considering quantitative or sequential relationships may result in many false positives and/or false negatives. To alleviate this problem, we propose a graph-based method for unsupervised log anomaly detection, dubbed Logs2Graphs, which first converts event logs into attributed, directed, and weighted graphs, and then leverages graph neural networks to perform graph-level anomaly detection. Specifically, we introduce One-Class Digraph Inception Convolutional Networks, abbreviated as OCDiGCN, a novel graph neural network model for detecting graph-level anomalies in a collection of attributed, directed, and weighted graphs. By coupling the graph representation and anomaly detection steps, OCDiGCN can learn a representation that is especially suited for anomaly detection, resulting in a high detection accuracy. Importantly, for each identified anomaly, we additionally provide a small subset of nodes that play a crucial role in OCDiGCN's prediction as explanations, which can offer valuable cues for subsequent root cause diagnosis. Experiments on five benchmark datasets show that Logs2Graphs performs at least on par state-of-the-art log anomaly detection methods on simple datasets while largely outperforming state-of-the-art log anomaly detection methods on complicated datasets.

Our experimental results show that the SDTLA method increases the profitability threshold of selfish mining up to 47$\\%$, while the WVBM method performs even better and is very close to the ideal situation where each miner's revenue is proportional to their shared hash processing power. Additionally, we demonstrate that both methods can effectively reduce the risks of double-spending by tuning the $Z$ Parameter. Our findings highlight the potential of SDTLA and WVBM as promising solutions for enhancing the security and efficiency of blockchain networks. ",

    "title": "Shared Growth of Graph Neural Networks via Free-direction Knowledge  Distillation",
    "abstract": "Knowledge distillation (KD) has shown to be effective to boost the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs), where the typical objective is to distill knowledge from a deeper teacher GNN into a shallower student GNN. However, it is often quite challenging to train a satisfactory deeper GNN due to the well-known over-parametrized and over-smoothing issues, leading to invalid knowledge transfer in practical applications. In this paper, we propose the first Free-direction Knowledge Distillation framework via reinforcement learning for GNNs, called FreeKD, which is no longer required to provide a deeper well-optimized teacher GNN. Our core idea is to collaboratively learn two shallower GNNs in an effort to exchange knowledge between them via reinforcement learning in a hierarchical way. As we observe that one typical GNN model often exhibits better and worse performances at different nodes during training, we devise a dynamic and free-direction knowledge transfer strategy that involves two levels of actions: 1) node-level action determines the directions of knowledge transfer between the corresponding nodes of two networks; and then 2) structure-level action determines which of the local structures generated by the node-level actions to be propagated. Furthermore, considering the diverse knowledge present in different GNNs when dealing with multi-view inputs, we introduce FreeKD++ as a solution to enable free-direction knowledge transfer among multiple shallow GNNs operating on multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate our approaches outperform the base GNNs in a large margin, and shows their efficacy to various GNNs. More surprisingly, our FreeKD has comparable or even better performance than traditional KD algorithms that distill knowledge from a deeper and stronger teacher GNN. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we examine cloud-edge-terminal IoT networks, where edges undertake a range of typical dynamic scheduling tasks. In these IoT networks, a central policy for each task can be constructed at a cloud server. The central policy can be then used by the edges conducting the task, thereby mitigating the need for them to learn their own policy from scratch. Furthermore, this central policy can be collaboratively learned at the cloud server by aggregating local experiences from the edges, thanks to the hierarchical architecture of the IoT networks. To this end, we propose a novel collaborative policy learning framework for dynamic scheduling tasks using federated reinforcement learning. For effective learning, our framework adaptively selects the tasks for collaborative learning in each round, taking into account the need for fairness among tasks. In addition, as a key enabler of the framework, we propose an edge-agnostic policy structure that enables the aggregation of local policies from different edges. We then provide the convergence analysis of the framework. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the approaches without collaborative policy learning. Notably, it accelerates the learning speed of the policies and allows newly arrived edges to adapt to their tasks more easily. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach that leverages domain variability to learn representations that are conditionally invariant to unwanted variability or distractors. Our approach identifies both spurious and invariant latent features necessary for achieving accurate reconstruction by placing distinct conditional priors on latent features. The invariant signals are disentangled from noise by enforcing independence which facilitates the construction of an interpretable model with a causal semantic. By exploiting the interplay between data domains and labels, our method simultaneously identifies invariant features and builds invariant predictors. We apply our method to grand biological challenges, such as data integration in single-cell genomics with the aim of capturing biological variations across datasets with many samples, obtained from different conditions or multiple laboratories. Our approach allows for the incorporation of specific biological mechanisms, including gene programs, disease states, or treatment conditions into the data integration process, bridging the gap between the theoretical assumptions and real biological applications. Specifically, the proposed approach helps to disentangle biological signals from data biases that are unrelated to the target task or the causal explanation of interest. Through extensive benchmarking using large-scale human hematopoiesis and human lung cancer data, we validate the superiority of our approach over existing methods and demonstrate that it can empower deeper insights into cellular heterogeneity and the identification of disease cell states.

In this paper, we tackle these typical problems of anomaly detection in surveillance video by combining Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to deal with the lack of labels and Multiple Camera Views (MC) to reduce occlusion and clutter effects. In the resulting MC-MIL algorithm we apply a multiple camera combined loss function to train a regression network with Sultani's MIL ranking function. To evaluate the MC-MIL algorithm first proposed here, the multiple camera PETS-2009 benchmark dataset was re-labeled for the anomaly detection task from multiple camera views. The result shows a significant performance improvement in F1 score compared to the single-camera configuration. ",

It is a complex task that requires machine learning algorithms, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Siamese networks. Besides, there are several limitations to consider when using these algorithms for image verification and classification tasks. In fact, training may be computationally intensive, requiring specialized hardware and significant computational resources to train and deploy. Moreover, it necessitates a large amount of labeled data, which can be time-consuming and costly to obtain. The main advantage of the proposed TinySiamese compared to the standard Siamese is that it does not require the whole CNN for training. In fact, using a pre-trained CNN as a feature extractor and the TinySiamese to learn the extracted features gave almost the same performance and efficiency as the standard Siamese for biometric verification. In this way, the TinySiamese solves the problems of memory and computational time with a small number of layers which did not exceed 7. It can be run under low-power machines which possess a normal GPU and cannot allocate a large RAM space. Using TinySiamese with only 8 GO of memory, the matching time decreased by 76.78% on the B2F (Biometric images of Fingerprints and Faces), FVC2000, FVC2002 and FVC2004 while the training time for 10 epochs went down by approximately 93.14% on the B2F, FVC2002, THDD-part1 and CASIA-B datasets. The accuracy of the fingerprint, gait (NM-angle 180 degree) and face verification tasks was better than the accuracy of a standard Siamese by 0.87%, 20.24% and 3.85% respectively.

Deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer a potential solution by designing descriptors as probabilistic latent vectors derived from molecular structures. These models can be trained on large datasets, which have only molecular structures, and applied to transfer learning. Nevertheless, the approximate posterior distribution of the latent vectors of the usual VAE assumes a simple multivariate Gaussian distribution with zero covariance, which may limit the performance of representing the latent features. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel molecular deep generative model that incorporates a hierarchical structure into the probabilistic latent vectors. We achieve this by a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). We demonstrate that our model can design effective molecular latent vectors for molecular property prediction from some experiments by small datasets on physical properties and activity.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the (discrete) \\emph{chemical reaction network (CRN)} computational model that emerged in the last two decades as an abstraction for molecular programming. The correctness of CRN protocols is typically established under one of two possible schedulers that determine how the execution advances: (1) a \\emph{stochastic scheduler} that obeys the (continuous time) Markov process dictated by the standard model of stochastic chemical kinetics; or (2) an \\emph{adversarial scheduler} whose only commitment is to maintain a certain fairness condition. The latter scheduler is justified by the fact that the former one crucially assumes ``idealized conditions'' that more often than not, do not hold in real wet-lab experiments. However, when it comes to analyzing the \\emph{runtime} of CRN protocols, the existing literature focuses strictly on the stochastic scheduler, thus raising the research question that drives this work: Is there a meaningful way to quantify the runtime of CRNs without the idealized conditions assumption? The main conceptual contribution of the current paper is to answer this question in the affirmative, formulating a new runtime measure for CRN protocols that does not rely on idealized conditions. This runtime measure is based on an adapted (weaker) fairness condition as well as a novel scheme that enables partitioning the execution into short \\emph{rounds} and charging the runtime for each round individually (inspired by definitions for the runtime of asynchronous distributed algorithms). Following that, we turn to investigate various fundamental computational tasks and establish (often tight) bounds on the runtime of the corresponding CRN protocols operating under the adversarial scheduler. This includes an almost complete chart of the runtime complexity landscape of predicate decidability tasks. ",

Several baselines have attempted to make SSL models exploit information about data distribution, and less dependent on the augmentation effect. However, there is no clear consensus on whether maximizing or minimizing the mutual information between representations of augmentation views practically contribute to improvement or degradation in performance of SSL models. This paper is a fundamental work where, we investigate role of mutual information in SSL, and reformulate the problem of SSL in the context of a new perspective on mutual information. To this end, we consider joint mutual information from the perspective of partial information decomposition (PID) as a key step in \\textbf{reliable multivariate information measurement}. PID enables us to decompose joint mutual information into three important components, namely, unique information, redundant information and synergistic information. Our framework aims for minimizing the redundant information between views and the desired target representation while maximizing the synergistic information at the same time. Our experiments lead to a re-calibration of two redundancy reduction baselines, and a proposal for a new SSL training protocol. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets and two downstream tasks show the effectiveness of this framework. ",

However, re-accessing source training data for unsupervised domain adaptation or labeling additional test data for model fine-tuning can be difficult due to privacy issues and high labeling costs, respectively. To solve this problem, we propose a novel atlas-guided test-time adaptation (TTA) method for robust 3D medical image segmentation, called AdaAtlas. AdaAtlas only takes one single unlabeled test sample as input and adapts the segmentation network by minimizing an atlas-based loss. Specifically, the network is adapted so that its prediction after registration is aligned with the learned atlas in the atlas space, which helps to reduce anatomical segmentation errors at test time. In addition, different from most existing TTA methods which restrict the adaptation to batch normalization blocks in the segmentation network only, we further exploit the use of channel and spatial attention blocks for improved adaptability at test time. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets from different sites show that AdaAtlas with attention blocks adapted (AdaAtlas-Attention) achieves superior performance improvements, greatly outperforming other competitive TTA methods.

This time-consuming, three-step process is a result of using subgradient descent to train CNNs. Because subgradient descent does not exactly train CNNs towards sparse, accurate structures, the latter two steps are necessary. Moreover, subgradient descent does not have any convergence guarantee. Therefore, we develop an alternative algorithm called proximal NS. Our proposed algorithm trains CNNs towards sparse, accurate structures, so identifying a scaling factor threshold is unnecessary and fine tuning the pruned CNNs is optional. Using Kurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz assumptions, we establish global convergence of proximal NS. Lastly, we validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm on VGGNet, DenseNet and ResNet on CIFAR 10/100.

Therefore, it is of no surprise that state of the art studies in shape understanding do not explicitly use this 3D information. In conjunction with this, triangular meshes remain the dominant shape representation for many downstream tasks, and their connectivity remain a relatively untapped source of potential for more profound shape reasoning. In this paper, we introduce ROAR, an iterative geometry/topology evolution approach to reconstruct 2-manifold triangular meshes from arbitrary 3D shape representations, that is highly suitable for large existing in-the-wild datasets. ROAR leverages the visual prior large datasets exhibit by evolving the geometry of the mesh via a 2D render loss, and a novel 3D projection loss, the Planar Projection. After each geometry iteration, our system performs topological corrections. Self-intersections are reduced following a geometrically motivated attenuation term, and resolution is added to required regions using a novel face scoring function. These steps alternate until convergence is achieved, yielding a high-quality manifold mesh. We evaluate ROAR on the notoriously messy yet popular dataset ShapeNet, and present ShapeROAR - a topologically valid yet still geometrically accurate version of ShapeNet. We compare our results to state-of-the-art reconstruction methods and demonstrate superior shape faithfulness, topological correctness, and triangulation quality. In addition, we demonstrate reconstructing a mesh from neural Signed Distance Functions (SDF), and achieve comparable Chamfer distance with much fewer SDF sampling operations than the commonly used Marching Cubes approach.

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), one of the fundamental technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT), can provide sensing and communication services efficiently for IoT-based applications, especially energy-limited applications. Clustering routing protocol plays an important role in reducing energy consumption and prolonging network lifetime. The cluster formation and cluster head selection are the key to improving the performance of the clustering routing protocol. An energy-efficient routing protocol based on multi-threshold segmentation (EERPMS) was proposed in this paper to improve the rationality of cluster formation and cluster head selection. In the stage of cluster formation, inspired by multi-threshold image segmentation, an innovative node clustering algorithm was developed. In the stage of cluster head selection, aiming at minimizing the network energy consumption, a calculation theory of the optimal number and location of cluster heads was established. Furthermore, a novel cluster head selection algorithm was constructed based on the residual energy and optimal location of cluster heads. Simulation results show that EERPMS can improve the distribution uniformity of cluster heads, prolong the network lifetime and save up to 64.50%, 58.60%, and 56.15% network energy as compared to RLEACH, CRPFCM, and FIGWO protocols respectively.

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are self-organizing monitoring networks with a large number of randomly deployed microsensor nodes to collect various physical information to realize tasks such as intelligent perception, efficient control, and decision-making. However, WSN nodes are powered by batteries, so they will run out of energy after a certain time. This energy limitation will greatly constrain the network performance like network lifetime and energy efficiency. In this study, to prolong the network lifetime, we proposed a multi-hop routing protocol based on game theory and coverage optimization (MRP-GTCO). Briefly, in the stage of setup, two innovational strategies including a clustering game with penalty function and cluster head coverage set were designed to realize the uniformity of cluster head distribution and improve the rationality of cluster head election. In the data transmission stage, we first derived the applicable conditions theorem of inter-cluster multi-hop routing. Based on this, a novel multi-hop path selection algorithm related to residual energy and node degree was proposed to provide an energy-efficient data transmission path. The simulation results showed that the MRP-GTCO protocol can effectively reduce the network energy consumption and extend the network lifetime by 159.22%, 50.76%, and 16.46% compared with LGCA, RLEACH, and ECAGT protocols.

    "abstract": "Efficient visual fault detection of freight trains is a critical part of ensuring the safe operation of railways under the restricted hardware environment. Although deep learning-based approaches have excelled in object detection, the efficiency of freight train fault detection is still insufficient to apply in real-world engineering. This paper proposes a heterogeneous self-distillation framework to ensure detection accuracy and speed while satisfying low resource requirements. The privileged information in the output feature knowledge can be transferred from the teacher to the student model through distillation to boost performance. We first adopt a lightweight backbone to extract features and generate a new heterogeneous knowledge neck. Such neck models positional information and long-range dependencies among channels through parallel encoding to optimize feature extraction capabilities. Then, we utilize the general distribution to obtain more credible and accurate bounding box estimates. Finally, we employ a novel loss function that makes the network easily concentrate on values near the label to improve learning efficiency. Experiments on four fault datasets reveal that our framework can achieve over 37 frames per second and maintain the highest accuracy in comparison with traditional distillation approaches. Moreover, compared to state-of-the-art methods, our framework demonstrates more competitive performance with lower memory usage and the smallest model size. ",

Though many open-source and proprietary secret detection tools are available, these tools output many false positives, making it difficult for developers to take action and teams to choose one tool out of many. To our knowledge, the secret detection tools are not yet compared and evaluated. Aims: The goal of our study is to aid developers in choosing a secret detection tool to reduce the exposure of secrets through an empirical investigation of existing secret detection tools. Method: We present an evaluation of five open-source and four proprietary tools against a benchmark dataset. Results: The top three tools based on precision are: GitHub Secret Scanner (75%), Gitleaks (46%), and Commercial X (25%), and based on recall are: Gitleaks (88%), SpectralOps (67%) and TruffleHog (52%). Our manual analysis of reported secrets reveals that false positives are due to employing generic regular expressions and ineffective entropy calculation. In contrast, false negatives are due to faulty regular expressions, skipping specific file types, and insufficient rulesets. Conclusions: We recommend developers choose tools based on secret types present in their projects to prevent missing secrets. In addition, we recommend tool vendors update detection rules periodically and correctly employ secret verification mechanisms by collaborating with API vendors to improve accuracy. ",

However, existing collaborative 3D object detectors in a fully supervised paradigm heavily rely on large-scale annotated 3D bounding boxes, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To tackle this issue, we propose a sparsely supervised collaborative 3D object detection framework SSC3OD, which only requires each agent to randomly label one object in the scene. Specifically, this model consists of two novel components, i.e., the pillar-based masked autoencoder (Pillar-MAE) and the instance mining module. The Pillar-MAE module aims to reason over high-level semantics in a self-supervised manner, and the instance mining module generates high-quality pseudo labels for collaborative detectors online. By introducing these simple yet effective mechanisms, the proposed SSC3OD can alleviate the adverse impacts of incomplete annotations. We generate sparse labels based on collaborative perception datasets to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets reveal that our proposed SSC3OD can effectively improve the performance of sparsely supervised collaborative 3D object detectors. ",

Nevertheless, the sparsity and noisiness of 4D radar point clouds hinder further performance improvement, and in-depth studies about its fusion with other modalities are lacking. On the other hand, most of the camera-based perception methods transform the extracted image perspective view features into the bird's-eye view geometrically via \"depth-based splatting\" proposed in Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS), and some researchers exploit other modals such as LiDARs or ordinary automotive radars for enhancement. Recently, a few works have applied the \"sampling\" strategy for image view transformation, showing that it outperforms \"splatting\" even without image depth prediction. However, the potential of \"sampling\" is not fully unleashed. In this paper, we investigate the \"sampling\" view transformation strategy on the camera and 4D imaging radar fusion-based 3D object detection. In the proposed model, LXL, predicted image depth distribution maps and radar 3D occupancy grids are utilized to aid image view transformation, called \"radar occupancy-assisted depth-based sampling\". Experiments on VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets show that the proposed method outperforms existing 3D object detection methods by a significant margin without bells and whistles. Ablation studies demonstrate that our method performs the best among different enhancement settings. ",

Aiming to maximize the SR, two power allocation (PA) strategies, called maximizing SR based on fractional programming (FP) (Max-SR-FP) and maximizing SR based on derivative operation (DO) (Max-SR-DO), are proposed by jointly designing the PA factors, beamforming vector, and phase shift matrix of IRS, subject to the power constraint at IRS. The former with higher performance employs the FP and successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithms to design the confidential message PA factor and the total PA factor at the base station, and the SCA algorithm is also utilized to design the beamforming vector and the phase shift matrix of the IRS. The latter with lower complexity adopts the DO, and equal amplitude reflecting (EAR) and general power iterative (GPI) methods to solve them, respectively. The simulation results show that compared with the benchmark PA schemes, both the proposed PA schemes achieve a significant SR performance improvement. Moreover, the SR gap between two proposed schemes decreases gradually with the increases of the number of IRS phase shift element. ",

Unfortunately, many prior anomaly detection methods were optimized for a specific \"known\" abnormality (e.g., brain tumor, bone fraction, cell types). Moreover, even though only the normal images were used in the training process, the abnormal images were oftenly employed during the validation process (e.g., epoch selection, hyper-parameter tuning), which might leak the supposed ``unknown\" abnormality unintentionally. In this study, we investigated these two essential aspects regarding universal anomaly detection in medical images by (1) comparing various anomaly detection methods across four medical datasets, (2) investigating the inevitable but often neglected issues on how to unbiasedly select the optimal anomaly detection model during the validation phase using only normal images, and (3) proposing a simple decision-level ensemble method to leverage the advantage of different kinds of anomaly detection without knowing the abnormality. The results of our experiments indicate that none of the evaluated methods consistently achieved the best performance across all datasets. Our proposed method enhanced the robustness of performance in general (average AUC 0.956). ",

However, accurately detecting anomalies in such data poses significant challenges. Existing approaches, including forecasting and reconstruction-based methods, struggle to address these challenges effectively. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel anomaly detection framework named ImDiffusion, which combines time series imputation and diffusion models to achieve accurate and robust anomaly detection. The imputation-based approach employed by ImDiffusion leverages the information from neighboring values in the time series, enabling precise modeling of temporal and inter-correlated dependencies, reducing uncertainty in the data, thereby enhancing the robustness of the anomaly detection process. ImDiffusion further leverages diffusion models as time series imputers to accurately capturing complex dependencies. We leverage the step-by-step denoised outputs generated during the inference process to serve as valuable signals for anomaly prediction, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness of the detection process. We evaluate the performance of ImDiffusion via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of detection accuracy and timeliness. ImDiffusion is further integrated into the real production system in Microsoft and observe a remarkable 11.4% increase in detection F1 score compared to the legacy approach. To the best of our knowledge, ImDiffusion represents a pioneering approach that combines imputation-based techniques with time series anomaly detection, while introducing the novel use of diffusion models to the field.

The node-level memory module is trained to model fine-grained, internal graph interactions among nodes for detecting locally abnormal graphs, while the graph-level memory module is dedicated to the learning of holistic normal patterns for detecting globally abnormal graphs.

    "abstract": "Structured network pruning is a practical approach to reduce computation cost directly while retaining the CNNs' generalization performance in real applications. However, identifying redundant filters is a core problem in structured network pruning, and current redundancy criteria only focus on individual filters' attributes. When pruning sparsity increases, these redundancy criteria are not effective or efficient enough. Since the filter-wise interaction also contributes to the CNN's prediction accuracy, we integrate the filter-wise interaction into the redundancy criterion. In our criterion, we introduce the filter importance and filter utilization strength to reflect the decision ability of individual and multiple filters. Utilizing this new redundancy criterion, we propose a structured network pruning approach SNPFI (Structured Network Pruning by measuring Filter-wise Interaction). During the pruning, the SNPFI can automatically assign the proper sparsity based on the filter utilization strength and eliminate the useless filters by filter importance. After the pruning, the SNPFI can recover pruned model's performance effectively without iterative training by minimizing the interaction difference. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the SNPFI with several commonly used CNN models, including AlexNet, MobileNetv1, and ResNet-50, on various image classification datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. For all experimental CNN models, nearly 60% of computation is reduced in a network compression while the classification accuracy remains. ",

However, these techniques do not account for representation resilience against noise in their design paradigms. Consequently, these effective methods suffer failure when confronted with noise outside the training distribution, such as complicated real-world noise that is usually opaque to model training. To address this issue, dual domains are optimized to separately model a canonical space for noisy representations, namely the Noise-Robust (NR) domain, and a twinned canonical clean space, namely the Noise-Free (NF) domain, by maximizing the interaction information between the representations. Given the dual canonical domains, we design a target-guided implicit neural mapping function to accurately translate the NR representations to the NF domain, yielding noise-resistant representations by eliminating noise regencies. The proposed method is a scalable module that can be readily integrated into existing learning systems to improve their robustness against noise. Comprehensive trials of various tasks using both synthetic and real-world noisy data demonstrate that the proposed Target-Guided Dual-Domain Translation (TDDT) method is able to achieve remarkable performance and robustness in the face of complex noisy images.

In doing so, we first model the VC-assisted DAG task scheduling as a Markov decision process. We then adopt a multi-head graph attention network (GAT) to extract the features of DAG subtasks. Our developed GAT enables a two-way aggregation of the topological information in a DAG task by simultaneously considering predecessors and successors of each subtask. We further introduce non-uniform DAG neighborhood sampling through codifying the scheduling priority of different subtasks, which makes our developed GAT generalizable to completely unseen DAG task topologies. Finally, we augment GAT into a double deep Q-network learning module to conduct subtask-to-vehicle assignment according to the extracted features of subtasks, while considering the dynamics and heterogeneity of the vehicles in VCs. Through simulating various DAG tasks under real-world movement traces of vehicles, we demonstrate that GA-DRL outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of DAG task completion time. ",

To address these challenges, we propose a fully automated approach for creating a fully rigged character with pose-dependent skinning weights, which can be solely learned from multi-view video. Therefore, we first acquire a rigged template, which is then statically skinned. Next, a coordinate-based MLP learns a skinning weights field parameterized over the position in a canonical pose space and the respective pose. Moreover, we introduce our pose- and view-dependent appearance field allowing us to differentiably render and supervise the posed mesh using multi-view imagery. We show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art while not relying on dense 4D scans. ",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a predictive control method for the water distribution networks (WDNs) powered by photovoltaics (PVs) and the electrical grid. This builds on the controller introduced in a previous study and is designed to reduce the economic costs associated with operating the WDN. To account for the uncertainty of the system, the problem is solved in a scenario optimization framework, where multiple scenarios are sampled from the uncertain variables related to PV power production. To accomplish this, a day-ahead PV power prediction method with a stochastic model is employed. The method is tested on a high-fidelity model of a WDN of a Danish town and the results demonstrate a substantial reduction in electrical costs through the integration of PVs, with PVs supplying $66.95\\%$ of the required energy. The study also compares the effectiveness of the stochastic optimization method with a deterministic optimization approach. ",

    "abstract": "We consider a user-centric cell-free massive MIMO wireless network with $L$ remote radio units, each with $M$ antennas, serving $K_{\\rm tot}$ user equipments (UEs). Most of the literature considers the regime $LM \\gg K_{\\rm tot}$, where the $K$ UEs are active on each time-frequency slot, and evaluates the system performance in terms of ergodic rates. In this paper, we take a quite different viewpoint. We observe that the regime of $LM \\gg K_{\\rm tot}$ corresponds to a lightly loaded system with low sum spectral efficiency (SE). In contrast, in most relevant scenarios, the number of UEs is much larger than the total number of antennas, but users are not all active at the same time. To achieve high sum SE and handle $K_{\\rm tot} \\gg ML$, users must be scheduled over the time-frequency resource. The number of active users $K_{\\rm act} \\leq K_{\\rm tot}$ must be chosen such that: 1) the network operates close to its maximum SE; 2) the active user set must be chosen dynamically over time in order to enforce fairness in terms of per-user time-averaged throughput rates. The fairness scheduling problem is formulated as the maximization of a concave componentwise non-decreasing network utility function of the per-user rates. Intermittent user activity imposes slot-by-slot coding/decoding which prevents the achievability of ergodic rates. Hence, we model the per-slot service rates using information outage probability. To obtain a tractable problem, we make a decoupling assumption on the CDF of the instantaneous mutual information seen at each UE $k$ receiver. We approximately enforce this condition with a conflict graph that prevents the simultaneous scheduling of users with large pilot contamination and propose an adaptive scheme for instantaneous service rate scheduling. Overall, the proposed dynamic scheduling is robust to system model uncertainties and can be easily implemented in practice. ",

Despite the fact that developers may have carelessly leaked their code on public repositories, our findings indicate that they tend to use significantly more secure passwords, regardless of the underlying programming language and context.

Using QMIX, one of the popular cooperative multi-agent reinforcement algorithms, as an example, we discuss four techniques to improve the robustness of SARL algorithms and extend them to multi-agent scenarios.

Specifically, we first show that in the time domain effective channel, the path delay only introduces interference among samples in adjacent time slots, while the Doppler becomes a phase term that does not affect the channel sparsity. This ``band-limited'' matrix structure motivates us to apply a reduced-size linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) filter to eliminate the effect of delay in the time domain, while exploiting the cross-domain iteration for minimizing the effect of Doppler by noticing that the time and Doppler are a pair of Fourier dual. The state (MSE) evolution was derived and compared with bounds to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves almost the same error performance as the optimal detection, but only requires a reduced complexity. ",

Most RGB-D SOD methods apply the same type of backbones and fusion modules to identically learn the multimodality and multistage features. However, these features contribute differently to the final saliency results, which raises two issues: 1) how to model discrepant characteristics of RGB images and depth maps; 2) how to fuse these cross-modality features in different stages. In this paper, we propose a high-order discrepant interaction network (HODINet) for RGB-D SOD. Concretely, we first employ transformer-based and CNN-based architectures as backbones to encode RGB and depth features, respectively. Then, the high-order representations are delicately extracted and embedded into spatial and channel attentions for cross-modality feature fusion in different stages. Specifically, we design a high-order spatial fusion (HOSF) module and a high-order channel fusion (HOCF) module to fuse features of the first two and the last two stages, respectively. Besides, a cascaded pyramid reconstruction network is adopted to progressively decode the fused features in a top-down pathway. Extensive experiments are conducted on seven widely used datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Artificial neural networks have emerged as the dominant models for solving an expanding range of tasks. The introduction of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques, which enable the automatic design of task-optimal networks, has led to remarkable advances. However, the NAS process is typically associated with long execution times and significant computational resource requirements. Once-For-All (OFA) and its successor, Once-For-All-2 (OFAv2), have been developed to mitigate these challenges. While maintaining exceptional performance and eliminating the need for retraining, they aim to build a single super-network model capable of directly extracting sub-networks satisfying different constraints. Neural Architecture Transfer (NAT) was developed to maximise the effectiveness of extracting sub-networks from a super-network. In this paper, we present NATv2, an extension of NAT that improves multi-objective search algorithms applied to dynamic super-network architectures. NATv2 achieves qualitative improvements in the extractable sub-networks by exploiting the improved super-networks generated by OFAv2 and incorporating new policies for initialisation, pre-processing and updating its networks archive. In addition, a post-processing pipeline based on fine-tuning is introduced. Experimental results show that NATv2 successfully improves NAT and is highly recommended for investigating high-performance architectures with a minimal number of parameters. ",

The key principle of the DT relies on creating a holistic representation of wireless network elements, in addition to decoupling the information pertaining to physical objects and dynamics, into a cyber twin. The cyber twin will then leverage this information for AI models training, and then reasoning and decision-making operations, which will be then reflected to the physical environment, for improved sustainability. Motivated by this, in this article, we dig deep into the intertwined role of wireless technologies as being enablers and enabled by the DT. Furthermore, we put a forward-looking vision of the integral role that future 6G networks are anticipated to play in order to realize an efficient DT.

A common theme in these designs is the small percent porosity in the structure ranging from 1 - 5\\%. In this work, the sheep horn was used as an inspiration due to its higher toughness when loaded in the radial direction compared to the longitudinal direction. Under dynamic transverse compression, we investigated the structure-property relations in low porosity structures characterized by their two-dimensional (2D) cross-sections. A diverse design space was created by combining polygonal tubules with different numbers of sides placed on a grid with different numbers of rows and columns. The volume fraction and the orientation angle of the tubules were also varied. The finite element (FE) method was used with a rate-dependent elastoplastic material model to generate the stress-strain curves in plane strain conditions. A gated recurrent unit (GRU) model was trained to predict the structures' stress-strain response and energy absorption under different strain rates and applied strains. The parameter-based model uses eight discrete parameters to characterize the design space and as inputs to the model. The trained GRU model can efficiently predict the response of a new design in as little as 0.16 ms and allows rapid performance evaluation of 128000 designs in the design space. The GRU predictions identified high-performance structures and four design trends that affect the specific energy absorption were extracted and discussed. ",

    "abstract": "This work introduces Neural Chronos Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural CODE), a deep neural network architecture that fits a continuous-time ODE dynamics for predicting the chronology of a system both forward and backward in time. To train the model, we solve the ODE as an initial value problem and a final value problem, similar to Neural ODEs. We also explore two approaches to combining Neural CODE with Recurrent Neural Networks by replacing Neural ODE with Neural CODE (CODE-RNN), and incorporating a bidirectional RNN for full information flow in both time directions (CODE-BiRNN), and variants with other update cells namely GRU and LSTM: CODE-GRU, CODE-BiGRU, CODE-LSTM, CODE-BiLSTM. Experimental results demonstrate that Neural CODE outperforms Neural ODE in learning the dynamics of a spiral forward and backward in time, even with sparser data. We also compare the performance of CODE-RNN/-GRU/-LSTM and CODE-BiRNN/-BiGRU/-BiLSTM against ODE-RNN/-GRU/-LSTM on three real-life time series data tasks: imputation of missing data for lower and higher dimensional data, and forward and backward extrapolation with shorter and longer time horizons. Our findings show that the proposed architectures converge faster, with CODE-BiRNN/-BiGRU/-BiLSTM consistently outperforming the other architectures on all tasks. ",

For both tasks, we design evaluation protocols based on realistic use-cases. We extensively benchmark each dataset and find that the performance of common models can vary drastically across datasets. In addition, on dynamic node property prediction tasks, we show that simple methods often achieve superior performance compared to existing temporal graph models. We believe that these findings open up opportunities for future research on temporal graphs.

    "abstract": "As the number of devices being interconnected increases, so does also the demand for (lightweight) security. To this end, Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) have been proposed as hardware primitives that can act as roots of trust and security. Recently, a new type of PUF based on Carbon NanoTubes (CNTs) has been proposed. At the same time, attacks and testing based on direct electrical probing appear to be moving towards non-invasive techniques. In this context, this work attempts to examine the potential for practical non-invasive probing attacks against the CNT-PUF, a novel PUF based on CNTs. Our results indicate that direct probing might potentially compromise the security of this PUF. Nevertheless, we note that this holds true only in the case that the attacker can directly probe the wire corresponding to the secret value of each CNT-PUF cell. Thus, we can conclude that the examined CNT-PUFs are rather resilient to direct probing attacks, that non-invasive probing methods appear to be promising for testing such PUFs, and that, in order for the attacker to gain the full-length value of the secret, all the relevant channels would need to be probed. Nevertheless, as our work proves, practical non-invasive attacks against the CNT-PUF are feasible and adequate countermeasures need to be employed in order to address this issue. ",

    "abstract": "The recent contrastive learning methods, due to their effectiveness in representation learning, have been widely applied to modeling graph data. Random perturbation is widely used to build contrastive views for graph data, which however, could accidentally break graph structures and lead to suboptimal performance. In addition, graph data is usually highly abstract, so it is hard to extract intuitive meanings and design more informed augmentation schemes. Effective representations should preserve key characteristics in data and abandon superfluous information. In this paper, we propose ENGAGE (ExplaNation Guided data AuGmEntation), where explanation guides the contrastive augmentation process to preserve the key parts in graphs and explore removing superfluous information. Specifically, we design an efficient unsupervised explanation method called smoothed activation map as the indicator of node importance in representation learning. Then, we design two data augmentation schemes on graphs for perturbing structural and feature information, respectively. We also provide justification for the proposed method in the framework of information theories. Experiments of both graph-level and node-level tasks, on various model architectures and on different real-world graphs, are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of ENGAGE.

Mixed-precision quantization has been proposed as a technique to minimize a DNN's memory footprint and maximize its execution efficiency, with negligible end-to-end precision degradation. In this work, we present a novel hardware and software stack for energy-efficient inference of mixed-precision Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs). We introduce Flex-V, a processor based on the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) that features fused Mac&Load mixed-precision dot product instructions; to avoid the exponential growth of the encoding space due to mixed-precision variants, we encode formats into the Control-Status Registers (CSRs). Flex-V core is integrated into a tightly-coupled cluster of eight processors; in addition, we provide a full framework for the end-to-end deployment of DNNs including a compiler, optimized libraries, and a memory-aware deployment flow. Our results show up to 91.5 MAC/cycle and 3.26 TOPS/W on the cluster, implemented in a commercial 22nm FDX technology, with up to 8.5x speed-up, and an area overhead of only 5.6% with respect to the baseline. To demonstrate the capabilities of the architecture, we benchmark it with end-to-end real-life QNNs, improving performance by 2x - 2.5x with respect to existing solutions using fully flexible programmable processors.

Inspired by the observation that linear learners on some datasets are able to resist the best known attacks even without any defenses, we further investigate whether datasets can be inherently robust to indiscriminate poisoning attacks for linear learners. For theoretical Gaussian distributions, we rigorously characterize the behavior of an optimal poisoning attack, defined as the poisoning strategy that attains the maximum risk of the induced model at a given poisoning budget. Our results prove that linear learners can indeed be robust to indiscriminate poisoning if the class-wise data distributions are well-separated with low variance and the size of the constraint set containing all permissible poisoning points is also small. These findings largely explain the drastic variation in empirical attack performance of the state-of-the-art poisoning attacks on linear learners across benchmark datasets, making an important initial step towards understanding the underlying reasons some learning tasks are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks.

We show that across numerous conformal methods and neural network families, performance greatly degrades under distribution shifts violating safety guarantees. Similarly, we show that in long-tailed settings the guarantees are frequently violated on many classes.

    "abstract": "Polygonal meshes have become the standard for discretely approximating 3D shapes, thanks to their efficiency and high flexibility in capturing non-uniform shapes. This non-uniformity, however, leads to irregularity in the mesh structure, making tasks like segmentation of 3D meshes particularly challenging. Semantic segmentation of 3D mesh has been typically addressed through CNN-based approaches, leading to good accuracy. Recently, transformers have gained enough momentum both in NLP and computer vision fields, achieving performance at least on par with CNN models, supporting the long-sought architecture universalism. Following this trend, we propose a transformer-based method for semantic segmentation of 3D mesh motivated by a better modeling of the graph structure of meshes, by means of global attention mechanisms. In order to address the limitations of standard transformer architectures in modeling relative positions of non-sequential data, as in the case of 3D meshes, as well as in capturing the local context, we perform positional encoding by means the Laplacian eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix, replacing the traditional sinusoidal positional encodings, and by introducing clustering-based features into the self-attention and cross-attention operators. Experimental results, carried out on three sets of the Shape COSEG Dataset, on the human segmentation dataset proposed in Maron et al., 2017 and on the ShapeNet benchmark, show how the proposed approach yields state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation of 3D meshes.

When a robot needs to interact with its environment, it must be able to comprehend the contextual information of its surroundings. This work focuses on classifying and localising objects within a map, which is under construction (SLAM) or already built. To further explore this direction, we propose a framework that can autonomously detect and localize predefined objects in a known environment using a multi-modal sensor fusion approach (combining RGB and depth data from an RGB-D camera and a lidar). The framework consists of three key elements: understanding the environment through RGB data, estimating depth through multi-modal sensor fusion, and managing artifacts (i.e., filtering and stabilizing measurements). The experiments show that the proposed framework can accurately detect 98% of the objects in the real sample environment, without post-processing, while 85% and 80% of the objects were mapped using the single RGBD camera or RGB + lidar setup respectively. The comparison with single-sensor (camera or lidar) experiments is performed to show that sensor fusion allows the robot to accurately detect near and far obstacles, which would have been noisy or imprecise in a purely visual or laser-based approach.

    "abstract": "In the current digitalization era, capturing and effectively representing knowledge is crucial in most real-world scenarios. In this context, knowledge graphs represent a potent tool for retrieving and organizing a vast amount of information in a properly interconnected and interpretable structure. However, their generation is still challenging and often requires considerable human effort and domain expertise, hampering the scalability and flexibility across different application fields. This paper proposes an innovative knowledge graph generation approach that leverages the potential of the latest generative large language models, such as GPT-3.5, that can address all the main critical issues in knowledge graph building. The approach is conveyed in a pipeline that comprises novel iterative zero-shot and external knowledge-agnostic strategies in the main stages of the generation process. Our unique manifold approach may encompass significant benefits to the scientific community. In particular, the main contribution can be summarized by: (i) an innovative strategy for iteratively prompting large language models to extract relevant components of the final graph; (ii) a zero-shot strategy for each prompt, meaning that there is no need for providing examples for \"guiding\" the prompt result; (iii) a scalable solution, as the adoption of LLMs avoids the need for any external resources or human expertise. To assess the effectiveness of our proposed model, we performed experiments on a dataset that covered a specific domain. We claim that our proposal is a suitable solution for scalable and versatile knowledge graph construction and may be applied to different and novel contexts. ",

    "abstract": "While storing documents on the cloud can be attractive, the question remains whether cloud providers can be trusted with storing private documents. Even if trusted, data breaches are ubiquitous. To prevent information leakage one can store documents encrypted. If encrypted under traditional schemes, one loses the ability to perform simple operations over the documents, such as searching through them. Searchable encryption schemes were proposed allowing some search functionality while documents remain encrypted. Orthogonally, research is done to find attacks that exploit search and access pattern leakage that most efficient schemes have. One type of such an attack is the ability to recover plaintext queries. Passive query-recovery attacks on single-keyword search schemes have been proposed in literature, however, conjunctive keyword search has not been considered, although keyword searches with two or three keywords appear more frequently in online searches. We introduce a generic extension strategy for existing passive query-recovery attacks against single-keyword search schemes and explore its applicability for the attack presented by Damie et al. (USENIX Security '21). While the original attack achieves up to a recovery rate of 85% against single-keyword search schemes for an attacker without exact background knowledge, our experiments show that the generic extension to conjunctive queries comes with a significant performance decrease achieving recovery rates of at most 32%. Assuming a stronger attacker with partial knowledge of the indexed document set boosts the recovery rate to 85% for conjunctive keyword queries with two keywords and achieves similar recovery rates as previous attacks by Cash et al. (CCS '15) and Islam et al. (NDSS '12) in the same setting for single-keyword search schemes. ",

This allows us to define a function space and a complexity measure that generalize prior results for shallow NNs, and we then examine their theoretical properties and implications in several aspects. First, we prove a correspondence between functions expressed by L-layer NNs and those belonging to L-level NHLs. Second, we prove generalization guarantees for learning an NHL with the complexity measure controlled. Third, corresponding to the training of multi-layer NNs in the infinite-width mean-field limit, we derive an evolution of the NHL characterized as the dynamics of multiple random fields.

On the other hand, it is well-known that graph invariants learned by these class of models are incomplete: there are pairs of non-isomorphic graphs which cannot be distinguished by standard graph neural networks. This is unsurprising given the computational difficulty of graph isomorphism testing on general graphs, but the situation begs to differ for special graph classes, for which efficient graph isomorphism testing algorithms are known, such as planar graphs. The goal of this work is to design architectures for efficiently learning complete invariants of planar graphs. Inspired by the classical planar graph isomorphism algorithm of Hopcroft and Tarjan, we propose PlanE as a framework for planar representation learning. PlanE includes architectures which can learn complete invariants over planar graphs while remaining practically scalable. We empirically validate the strong performance of the resulting model architectures on well-known planar graph benchmarks, achieving multiple state-of-the-art results. ",

By incorporating these extra points, SAM can generate augmented segmentation masks based on the augmented point prompts and the initial prompt, resulting in improved segmentation performance. We evaluate four point augmentation techniques: random selection, maximum difference entropy, maximum distance, and a saliency model. Experiments on the COCO, Fundus, and Chest X-ray datasets demonstrate that SAMAug can boost SAM's segmentation results, especially using the maximum distance and saliency model methods.

    "abstract": "Neural material representations are becoming a popular way to represent materials for rendering. They are more expressive than analytic models and occupy less memory than tabulated BTFs. However, existing neural materials are immutable, meaning that their output for a certain query of UVs, camera, and light vector is fixed once they are trained. While this is practical when there is no need to edit the material, it can become very limiting when the fragment of the material used for training is too small or not tileable, which frequently happens when the material has been captured with a gonioreflectometer. In this paper, we propose a novel neural material representation which jointly tackles the problems of BTF compression, tiling, and extrapolation. At test time, our method uses a guidance image as input to condition the neural BTF to the structural features of this input image. Then, the neural BTF can be queried as a regular BTF using UVs, camera, and light vectors. Every component in our framework is purposefully designed to maximize BTF encoding quality at minimal parameter count and computational complexity, achieving competitive compression rates compared with previous work. We demonstrate the results of our method on a variety of synthetic and captured materials, showing its generality and capacity to learn to represent many optical properties. ",

    "abstract": "Synchronization of coupled dynamical systems is a widespread phenomenon in both biological and engineered networks, and understanding this behavior is crucial for controlling such systems. Considerable research has been dedicated to identifying the conditions that promote synchronization in diffusively coupled systems, where coupling relies on the difference between the states of neighboring systems and vanishes on the synchronization manifold. In particular, contraction theory provides an elegant method for analyzing synchronization patterns in diffusively coupled networks. However, these approaches do not fully explain the emergence of synchronization behavior in non-diffusively coupled networks where the coupling does not vanish on the synchronization manifold and hence the dynamics on the synchronization manifold differ from the uncoupled systems. Inspired by neuronal networks connected via non-diffusive chemical synapses, we extend contraction theory to establish sufficient conditions for global synchronization in general non-diffusively coupled nonlinear networks. We demonstrate the theoretical results on a network of Hindmarsh-Rose oscillators connected via chemical synapses and networks of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators connected via chemical synapses and additive coupling.

    "abstract": "The accurate segmentation of medical images is a crucial step in obtaining reliable morphological statistics. However, training a deep neural network for this task requires a large amount of labeled data to ensure high-accuracy results. To address this issue, we propose using progressive text prompts as prior knowledge to guide the segmentation process. Our model consists of two stages. In the first stage, we perform contrastive learning on natural images to pretrain a powerful prior prompt encoder (PPE). This PPE leverages text prior prompts to generate multimodality features. In the second stage, medical image and text prior prompts are sent into the PPE inherited from the first stage to achieve the downstream medical image segmentation task. A multiscale feature fusion block (MSFF) combines the features from the PPE to produce multiscale multimodality features. These two progressive features not only bridge the semantic gap but also improve prediction accuracy. Finally, an UpAttention block refines the predicted results by merging the image and text features. This design provides a simple and accurate way to leverage multiscale progressive text prior prompts for medical image segmentation. Compared with using only images, our model achieves high-quality results with low data annotation costs. Moreover, our model not only has excellent reliability and validity on medical images but also performs well on natural images. The experimental results on different image datasets demonstrate that our model is effective and robust for image segmentation. ",

In this article, we investigate the problem of feature selection in neural networks. Although the group LASSO has been utilized to select variables for learning with neural networks, it tends to select unimportant variables into the model to compensate for its over-shrinkage. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework of sparse-input neural networks using group concave regularization for feature selection in both low-dimensional and high-dimensional settings. The main idea is to apply a proper concave penalty to the $l_2$ norm of weights from all outgoing connections of each input node, and thus obtain a neural net that only uses a small subset of the original variables. In addition, we develop an effective algorithm based on backward path-wise optimization to yield stable solution paths, in order to tackle the challenge of complex optimization landscapes. Our extensive simulation studies and real data examples demonstrate satisfactory finite sample performances of the proposed estimator, in feature selection and prediction for modeling continuous, binary, and time-to-event outcomes.

    "abstract": "Cortical surface registration plays a crucial role in aligning cortical functional and anatomical features across individuals. However, conventional registration algorithms are computationally inefficient. Recently, learning-based registration algorithms have emerged as a promising solution, significantly improving processing efficiency. Nonetheless, there remains a gap in the development of a learning-based method that exceeds the state-of-the-art conventional methods simultaneously in computational efficiency, registration accuracy, and distortion control, despite the theoretically greater representational capabilities of deep learning approaches. To address the challenge, we present SUGAR, a unified unsupervised deep-learning framework for both rigid and non-rigid registration. SUGAR incorporates a U-Net-based spherical graph attention network and leverages the Euler angle representation for deformation. In addition to the similarity loss, we introduce fold and multiple distortion losses, to preserve topology and minimize various types of distortions. Furthermore, we propose a data augmentation strategy specifically tailored for spherical surface registration, enhancing the registration performance. Through extensive evaluation involving over 10,000 scans from 7 diverse datasets, we showed that our framework exhibits comparable or superior registration performance in accuracy, distortion, and test-retest reliability compared to conventional and learning-based methods. Additionally, SUGAR achieves remarkable sub-second processing times, offering a notable speed-up of approximately 12,000 times in registering 9,000 subjects from the UK Biobank dataset in just 32 minutes. This combination of high registration performance and accelerated processing time may greatly benefit large-scale neuroimaging studies. ",

This is the first non-linear model for activation functions that relies on a signal processing perspective, providing high flexibility and expressiveness to the network.

    "abstract": "Under the framework of network-based neurodegeneration, brain functional connectome (FC)-based Graph Neural Networks (GNN) have emerged as a valuable tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, these models are tailored for brain FC at a single time point instead of characterizing FC trajectory. Discerning how FC evolves with disease progression, particularly at the predementia stages such as cognitively normal individuals with amyloid deposition or individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is crucial for delineating disease spreading patterns and developing effective strategies to slow down or even halt disease advancement. In this work, we proposed the first interpretable framework for brain FC trajectory embedding with application to neurodegenerative disease diagnosis and prognosis, namely Brain Tokenized Graph Transformer (Brain TokenGT). It consists of two modules: 1) Graph Invariant and Variant Embedding (GIVE) for generation of node and spatio-temporal edge embeddings, which were tokenized for downstream processing; 2) Brain Informed Graph Transformer Readout (BIGTR) which augments previous tokens with trainable type identifiers and non-trainable node identifiers and feeds them into a standard transformer encoder to readout. We conducted extensive experiments on two public longitudinal fMRI datasets of the AD continuum for three tasks, including differentiating MCI from controls, predicting dementia conversion in MCI, and classification of amyloid positive or negative cognitively normal individuals. Based on brain FC trajectory, the proposed Brain TokenGT approach outperformed all the other benchmark models and at the same time provided excellent interpretability.

    "abstract": "Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a highly prevalent chronic musculoskeletal condition with no currently available treatment. The manifestation of KOA is heterogeneous and prediction of its progression is challenging. Current literature suggests that the use of multi-modal data and advanced modeling methods, such as the ones based on Deep Learning, has promise in tackling this challenge. To date, however, the evidence on the efficacy of this approach is limited. In this study, we leveraged recent advances in Deep Learning and, using a Transformer approach, developed a unified framework for the multi-modal fusion of knee imaging data. Subsequently, we analyzed its performance across a range of scenarios by investigating multiple progression horizons -- from short-term to long-term. We report our findings using a large cohort (n=2421-3967) derived from the Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset. We show that structural knee MRI allows identifying radiographic KOA progressors on par with multi-modal fusion approaches, achieving an area under the ROC curve (ROC AUC) of 0.70-0.76 and Average Precision (AP) of 0.15-0.54 in 2-8 year horizons. Progression within 1 year was better predicted with a multi-modal method using X-ray, structural, and compositional MR images -- ROC AUC of 0.76(0.04), AP of 0.13(0.04) -- or via clinical data. Our follow-up analysis generally shows that prediction from the imaging data is more accurate for post-traumatic subjects, and we further investigate which subject subgroups may benefit the most. The present study provides novel insights into multi-modal imaging of KOA and brings a unified data-driven framework for studying its progression in an end-to-end manner, providing new tools for the design of more efficient clinical trials.

    "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive technique for breast cancer detection among current clinical imaging modalities. Contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) provides superior differentiation between tumors and invaded healthy tissue, and has become an indispensable technique in the detection and evaluation of cancer. However, the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) to obtain CE-MRI may be associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and may lead to bioaccumulation in the brain, posing a potential risk to human health. Moreover, and likely more important, the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents requires the cannulation of a vein, and the injection of the contrast media which is cumbersome and places a burden on the patient. To reduce the use of contrast agents, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is emerging as a key imaging technique, although currently usually complementing breast CE-MRI. In this study, we develop a multi-sequence fusion network to synthesize CE-MRI based on T1-weighted MRI and DWIs. DWIs with different b-values are fused to efficiently utilize the difference features of DWIs. Rather than proposing a pure data-driven approach, we invent a multi-sequence attention module to obtain refined feature maps, and leverage hierarchical representation information fused at different scales while utilizing the contributions from different sequences from a model-driven approach by introducing the weighted difference module. The results show that the multi-b-value DWI-based fusion model can potentially be used to synthesize CE-MRI, thus theoretically reducing or avoiding the use of GBCA, thereby minimizing the burden to patients.

For this reason automated system health management approaches are becoming increasingly critical to ensure nominal telescope operations. We propose a new machine learning anomaly detection framework for classifying both commonly occurring anomalies in radio telescopes as well as detecting unknown rare anomalies that the system has potentially not yet seen. To evaluate our method, we present a dataset consisting of 7050 autocorrelation-based spectrograms from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope and assign 10 different labels relating to the system-wide anomalies from the perspective of telescope operators. This includes electronic failures, miscalibration, solar storms, network and compute hardware errors among many more. We demonstrate how a novel Self Supervised Learning (SSL) paradigm, that utilises both context prediction and reconstruction losses, is effective in learning normal behaviour of the LOFAR telescope. We present the Radio Observatory Anomaly Detector (ROAD), a framework that combines both SSL-based anomaly detection and a supervised classification, thereby enabling both classification of both commonly occurring anomalies and detection of unseen anomalies. We demonstrate that our system is real-time in the context of the LOFAR data processing pipeline, requiring <1ms to process a single spectrogram. Furthermore, ROAD obtains an anomaly detection F-2 score of 0.92 while maintaining a false positive rate of ~2\\%, as well as a mean per-class classification F-2 score 0.89, outperforming other related works.

    "title": "Streamlined Lensed Quasar Identification in Multiband Images via  Ensemble Networks",
    "abstract": "Quasars experiencing strong lensing offer unique viewpoints on subjects like the cosmic expansion rate, the dark matter profile within the foreground deflectors, and the quasar host galaxies. Unfortunately, identifying them in astronomical images is challenging since they are overwhelmed by the abundance of non-lenses. To address this, we have developed a novel approach by ensembling cutting-edge convolutional networks (CNNs) -- i.e., ResNet, Inception, NASNet, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and RegNet -- along with vision transformers (ViTs) trained on realistic galaxy-quasar lens simulations based on the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) multiband images. While the individual model exhibits remarkable performance when evaluated against the test dataset, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of $>$97.4% and a median false positive rate of 3.1%, it struggles to generalize in real data, indicated by numerous spurious sources picked by each classifier. A significant improvement is achieved by averaging these CNNs and ViTs, resulting in the impurities being downsized by factors up to 40. Subsequently, combining the HSC images with the UKIRT, VISTA, and unWISE data, we retrieve approximately 60 million sources as parent samples and reduce this to 892,609 after employing a photometry preselection to discover $z>1.5$ lensed quasars with Einstein radii of $\\theta_\\mathrm{E}<5$ arcsec. Afterward, the ensemble classifier indicates 3991 sources with a high probability of being lenses, for which we visually inspect, yielding 161 prevailing candidates awaiting spectroscopic confirmation. These outcomes suggest that automated deep learning pipelines hold great potential in effectively detecting strong lenses in vast datasets with minimal manual visual inspection involved. ",

    "abstract": "Entropy measures quantify the amount of information and correlations present in a quantum system. In practice, when the quantum state is unknown and only copies thereof are available, one must resort to the estimation of such entropy measures. Here we propose a variational quantum algorithm for estimating the von Neumann and R\\'enyi entropies, as well as the measured relative entropy and measured R\\'enyi relative entropy. Our approach first parameterizes a variational formula for the measure of interest by a quantum circuit and a classical neural network, and then optimizes the resulting objective over parameter space. Numerical simulations of our quantum algorithm are provided, using a noiseless quantum simulator. The algorithm provides accurate estimates of the various entropy measures for the examples tested, which renders it as a promising approach for usage in downstream tasks. ",
