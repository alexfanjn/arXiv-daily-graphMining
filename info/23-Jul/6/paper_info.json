    "title": "Towards Few-shot Inductive Link Prediction on Knowledge Graphs: A  Relational Anonymous Walk-guided Neural Process Approach",
    "abstract": "Few-shot inductive link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs) aims to predict missing links for unseen entities with few-shot links observed. Previous methods are limited to transductive scenarios, where entities exist in the knowledge graphs, so they are unable to handle unseen entities. Therefore, recent inductive methods utilize the sub-graphs around unseen entities to obtain the semantics and predict links inductively. However, in the few-shot setting, the sub-graphs are often sparse and cannot provide meaningful inductive patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel relational anonymous walk-guided neural process for few-shot inductive link prediction on knowledge graphs, denoted as RawNP. Specifically, we develop a neural process-based method to model a flexible distribution over link prediction functions. This enables the model to quickly adapt to new entities and estimate the uncertainty when making predictions. To capture general inductive patterns, we present a relational anonymous walk to extract a series of relational motifs from few-shot observations. These motifs reveal the distinctive semantic patterns on KGs that support inductive predictions. Extensive experiments on typical benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model derives new state-of-the-art performance. ",

    "abstract": "Model evolution and constant availability of data are two common phenomena in large-scale real-world machine learning applications, e.g. ads and recommendation systems. To adapt, the real-world system typically retrain with all available data and online learn with recently available data to update the models periodically with the goal of better serving performance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, named Confidence Ranking, which designs the optimization objective as a ranking function with two different models. Our confidence ranking loss allows direct optimization of the logits output for different convex surrogate functions of metrics, e.g. AUC and Accuracy depending on the target task and dataset. Armed with our proposed methods, our experiments show that the introduction of confidence ranking loss can outperform all baselines on the CTR prediction tasks of public and industrial datasets. This framework has been deployed in the advertisement system of JD.com to serve the main traffic in the fine-rank stage. ",

In Sinitic Historical Phonology, notable tasks that could benefit from machine learning include the comparison of dialects and reconstruction of proto-languages systems. Motivated by this, this paper provides an approach for obtaining multi-dialectal representations of Sinitic syllables, by constructing a knowledge graph from structured phonological data, then applying the BoxE technique from knowledge base learning. We applied unsupervised clustering techniques to the obtained representations to observe that the representations capture phonemic contrast from the input dialects. Furthermore, we trained classifiers to perform inference of unobserved Middle Chinese labels, showing the representations' potential for indicating archaic, proto-language features. The representations can be used for performing completion of fragmented Sinitic phonological knowledge bases, estimating divergences between different characters, or aiding the exploration and reconstruction of archaic features.

The method is showcased on a practical problem, namely to derive an ontology representing the NIS 2 directive, which is the peak of cybersecurity prescripts at the European level.

    "abstract": "Despite large-scale pre-trained language models have achieved striking results for text classificaion, recent work has raised concerns about the challenge of shortcut learning. In general, a keyword is regarded as a shortcut if it creates a superficial association with the label, resulting in a false prediction. Conversely, shortcut learning can be mitigated if the model relies on robust causal features that help produce sound predictions. To this end, many studies have explored post-hoc interpretable methods to mine shortcuts and causal features for robustness and generalization. However, most existing methods focus only on single word in a sentence and lack consideration of word-group, leading to wrong causal features. To solve this problem, we propose a new Word-Group mining approach, which captures the causal effect of any keyword combination and orders the combinations that most affect the prediction. Our approach bases on effective post-hoc analysis and beam search, which ensures the mining effect and reduces the complexity. Then, we build a counterfactual augmentation method based on the multiple word-groups, and use an adaptive voting mechanism to learn the influence of different augmentated samples on the prediction results, so as to force the model to pay attention to effective causal features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by several tasks on 8 affective review datasets and 4 toxic language datasets, including cross-domain text classificaion, text attack and gender fairness test.

In this work, we study sublinear time algorithms to approximate the effective resistance of an adjacent pair $s$ and $t$. We consider the classical adjacency list model for local algorithms. While recent works have provided sublinear time algorithms for expander graphs, we prove several lower bounds for general graphs of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges: 1.It needs $\\Omega(n)$ queries to obtain $1.01$-approximations of the effective resistance of an adjacent pair $s$ and $t$, even for graphs of degree at most 3 except $s$ and $t$. 2.For graphs of degree at most $d$ and any parameter $\\ell$, it needs $\\Omega(m/\\ell)$ queries to obtain $c \\cdot \\min\\{d, \\ell\\}$-approximations where $c>0$ is a universal constant. Moreover, we supplement the first lower bound by providing a sublinear time $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for graphs of degree 2 except the pair $s$ and $t$. One of our technical ingredients is to bound the expansion of a graph in terms of the smallest non-trivial eigenvalue of its Laplacian matrix after removing edges. We discover a new lower bound on the eigenvalues of perturbed graphs (resp. perturbed matrices) by incorporating the effective resistance of the removed edge (resp. the leverage scores of the removed rows), which may be of independent interest.

However, their vulnerability to adversarial examples poses a security risk. Existing defense methods lack interpretability, making it hard to understand adversarial classifications and identify model vulnerabilities. To address this, we propose the Interpretability and Transparency-Driven Detection and Transformation (IT-DT) framework. It focuses on interpretability and transparency in detecting and transforming textual adversarial examples. IT-DT utilizes techniques like attention maps, integrated gradients, and model feedback for interpretability during detection. This helps identify salient features and perturbed words contributing to adversarial classifications. In the transformation phase, IT-DT uses pre-trained embeddings and model feedback to generate optimal replacements for perturbed words. By finding suitable substitutions, we aim to convert adversarial examples into non-adversarial counterparts that align with the model's intended behavior while preserving the text's meaning. Transparency is emphasized through human expert involvement. Experts review and provide feedback on detection and transformation results, enhancing decision-making, especially in complex scenarios. The framework generates insights and threat intelligence empowering analysts to identify vulnerabilities and improve model robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IT-DT in detecting and transforming adversarial examples. The approach enhances interpretability, provides transparency, and enables accurate identification and successful transformation of adversarial inputs. By combining technical analysis and human expertise, IT-DT significantly improves the resilience and trustworthiness of transformer-based text classifiers against adversarial attacks. ",

Experiments show that vONTSS outperforms existing semi-supervised topic modeling methods in classification accuracy and diversity. vONTSS also supports unsupervised topic modeling. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that vONTSS in the unsupervised setting outperforms recent NTMs on multiple aspects: vONTSS discovers highly clustered and coherent topics on benchmark datasets.

    "abstract": "Traffic forecasting is a highly challenging task owing to the dynamical spatio-temporal dependencies of traffic flows. To handle this, we focus on modeling the spatio-temporal dynamics and propose a network termed Edge Squeeze Graph Convolutional Network (ESGCN) to forecast traffic flow in multiple regions. ESGCN consists of two modules: W-module and ES module. W-module is a fully node-wise convolutional network. It encodes the time-series of each traffic region separately and decomposes the time-series at various scales to capture fine and coarse features. The ES module models the spatio-temporal dynamics using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and generates an Adaptive Adjacency Matrix (AAM) with temporal features. To improve the accuracy of AAM, we introduce three key concepts. 1) Using edge features to directly capture the spatiotemporal flow representation among regions. 2) Applying an edge attention mechanism to GCN to extract the AAM from the edge features. Here, the attention mechanism can effectively determine important spatio-temporal adjacency relations. 3) Proposing a novel node contrastive loss to suppress obstructed connections and emphasize related connections. Experimental results show that ESGCN achieves state-of-the-art performance by a large margin on four real-world datasets (PEMS03, 04, 07, and 08) with a low computational cost. ",

We hypothesize that the direct mel-prediction hampers training/model efficiency due to the entanglement of speech content with ambient information and speaker characteristics. To this end, we propose RobustL2S, a modularized framework for Lip-to-Speech synthesis. First, a non-autoregressive sequence-to-sequence model maps self-supervised visual features to a representation of disentangled speech content. A vocoder then converts the speech features into raw waveforms. Extensive evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our setup, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the unconstrained Lip2Wav dataset and the constrained GRID and TCD-TIMIT datasets.

In this study, we propose a novel model which combines a novel data augmentation strategy called snapshot merging with the DynGESN for dealing with DPC tasks. In our model, the snapshot merging strategy is designed for forming new snapshots by merging neighboring snapshots over time, and then multiple reservoir encoders are set for capturing spatiotemporal features from merged snapshots. After those, the logistic regression is adopted for decoding the sum-pooled embeddings into the classification results.

    "abstract": "People with diabetes must carefully monitor their blood glucose levels, especially after eating. Blood glucose regulation requires a proper combination of food intake and insulin boluses. Glucose prediction is vital to avoid dangerous post-meal complications in treating individuals with diabetes. Although traditional methods, such as artificial neural networks, have shown high accuracy rates, sometimes they are not suitable for developing personalised treatments by physicians due to their lack of interpretability. In this study, we propose a novel glucose prediction method emphasising interpretability: Interpretable Sparse Identification by Grammatical Evolution. Combined with a previous clustering stage, our approach provides finite difference equations to predict postprandial glucose levels up to two hours after meals. We divide the dataset into four-hour segments and perform clustering based on blood glucose values for the twohour window before the meal. Prediction models are trained for each cluster for the two-hour windows after meals, allowing predictions in 15-minute steps, yielding up to eight predictions at different time horizons. Prediction safety was evaluated based on Parkes Error Grid regions. Our technique produces safe predictions through explainable expressions, avoiding zones D (0.2% average) and E (0%) and reducing predictions on zone C (6.2%). In addition, our proposal has slightly better accuracy than other techniques, including sparse identification of non-linear dynamics and artificial neural networks. The results demonstrate that our proposal provides interpretable solutions without sacrificing prediction accuracy, offering a promising approach to glucose prediction in diabetes management that balances accuracy, interpretability, and computational efficiency.

    "abstract": "Dynamic programming on various graph decompositions is one of the most fundamental techniques used in parameterized complexity. Unfortunately, even if we consider concepts as simple as path or tree decompositions, such dynamic programming uses space that is exponential in the decomposition's width, and there are good reasons to believe that this is necessary. However, it has been shown that in graphs of low treedepth it is possible to design algorithms which achieve polynomial space complexity without requiring worse time complexity than their counterparts working on tree decompositions of bounded width. Here, treedepth is a graph parameter that, intuitively speaking, takes into account both the depth and the width of a tree decomposition of the graph, rather than the width alone. Motivated by the above, we consider graphs that admit clique expressions with bounded depth and label count, or equivalently, graphs of low shrubdepth (sd). Here, sd is a bounded-depth analogue of cliquewidth, in the same way as td is a bounded-depth analogue of treewidth. We show that also in this setting, bounding the depth of the decomposition is a deciding factor for improving the space complexity. Precisely, we prove that on $n$-vertex graphs equipped with a tree-model (a decomposition notion underlying sd) of depth $d$ and using $k$ labels, we can solve - Independent Set in time $2^{O(dk)}\\cdot n^{O(1)}$ using $O(dk^2\\log n)$ space; - Max Cut in time $n^{O(dk)}$ using $O(dk\\log n)$ space; and - Dominating Set in time $2^{O(dk)}\\cdot n^{O(1)}$ using $n^{O(1)}$ space via a randomized algorithm. We also establish a lower bound, conditional on a certain assumption about the complexity of Longest Common Subsequence, which shows that at least in the case of IS the exponent of the parametric factor in the time complexity has to grow with $d$ if one wishes to keep the space complexity polynomial.

Our work improves the FPR95 by 8% compared to the current highest-performing work when the models are trained without out-of-distribution data. We increase the performance by 77% compared to a vanilla implementation of the Wide ResNet. We release the SHIPS dataset and show the effectiveness of our method by improving the FPR95 by 44.2% with respect to the baseline. Our approach is model agnostic, easy to implement, and often does not require model retraining. ",

    "abstract": "Although deep neural networks endow the downsampled superpoints with discriminative feature representations, directly matching them is usually not used alone in state-of-the-art methods, mainly for two reasons. First, the correspondences are inevitably noisy, so RANSAC-like refinement is usually adopted. Such ad hoc postprocessing, however, is slow and not differentiable, which can not be jointly optimized with feature learning. Second, superpoints are sparse and thus more RANSAC iterations are needed. Existing approaches use the coarse-to-fine strategy to propagate the superpoints correspondences to the point level, which are not discriminative enough and further necessitates the postprocessing refinement. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach to extract correspondences by directly matching superpoints using a global softmax layer in an end-to-end manner, which are used to determine the rigid transformation between the source and target point cloud. Compared with methods that directly predict corresponding points, by leveraging the rich information from the superpoints matchings, we can obtain more accurate estimation of the transformation and effectively filter out outliers without any postprocessing refinement. As a result, our approach is not only fast, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging ModelNet and 3DMatch benchmarks. Our code and model weights will be publicly released. ",

To address this issue, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (GCN) method for the multi-channel speaker verification with ad-hoc microphone arrays. It includes a feature aggregation block and a channel selection block, both of which are built on graphs. The feature aggregation block fuses speaker features among different time and channels by a spatial-temporal GCN. The graph-based channel selection block discards the noisy channels that may contribute negatively to the system. The proposed method is flexible in incorporating various kinds of graphs and prior knowledge. We compared the proposed method with six representative methods in both real-world and simulated environments. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a relative equal error rate (EER) reduction of $\\mathbf{15.39\\%}$ lower than the strongest referenced method in the simulated datasets, and $\\mathbf{17.70\\%}$ lower than the latter in the real datasets. Moreover, its performance is robust across different signal-to-noise ratios and reverberation time. ",

The accumulation of amyloid-beta in the brain, measured through 18F-florbetapir (AV45) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, has been widely used for early diagnosis of AD. However, the relationship between amyloid-beta accumulation and AD pathophysiology remains unclear, and causal inference approaches are needed to uncover how amyloid-beta levels can impact AD development. In this paper, we propose a graph varying coefficient neural network (GVCNet) for estimating the individual treatment effect with continuous treatment levels using a graph convolutional neural network.

In the last decade or so, the research interest on adversarial machine learning has grown significantly, revealing how learning applications could be severely impacted by effective attacks. Although early results of adversarial machine learning indicate the huge potential of the approach to specific domains such as image processing, still there is a gap in both the research literature and practice regarding how to generalize adversarial techniques in other domains and applications. Fraud detection is a critical defense mechanism for data economy, as it is for other applications as well, which poses several challenges for machine learning.

This issue leads to unfair performance comparisons and potentially misleading results. Specifically, there is a lack of uniformity in data processing pipelines, resulting in inconsistent data inputs for detection models. Additionally, there are noticeable differences in experimental settings, and evaluation strategies and metrics lack standardization. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for deepfake detection, called DeepfakeBench, which offers three key contributions: 1) a unified data management system to ensure consistent input across all detectors, 2) an integrated framework for state-of-the-art methods implementation, and 3) standardized evaluation metrics and protocols to promote transparency and reproducibility. Featuring an extensible, modular-based codebase, DeepfakeBench contains 15 state-of-the-art detection methods, 9 deepfake datasets, a series of deepfake detection evaluation protocols and analysis tools, as well as comprehensive evaluations. Moreover, we provide new insights based on extensive analysis of these evaluations from various perspectives (e.g., data augmentations, backbones).

    "abstract": "Many recent practical and theoretical breakthroughs focus on adversarial team multi-player games (ATMGs) in ex ante correlation scenarios. In this setting, team members are allowed to coordinate their strategies only before the game starts. Although there existing algorithms for solving extensive-form ATMGs, the size of the game tree generated by the previous algorithms grows exponentially with the number of players. Therefore, how to deal with large-scale zero-sum extensive-form ATMGs problems close to the real world is still a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a generic multi-player transformation algorithm, which can transform any multi-player game tree satisfying the definition of AMTGs into a 2-player game tree, such that finding a team-maxmin equilibrium with correlation (TMECor) in large-scale ATMGs can be transformed into solving NE in 2-player games. To achieve this goal, we first introduce a new structure named private information pre-branch, which consists of a temporary chance node and coordinator nodes and aims to make decisions for all potential private information on behalf of the team members. We also show theoretically that NE in the transformed 2-player game is equivalent TMECor in the original multi-player game. This work significantly reduces the growth of action space and nodes from exponential to constant level. This enables our work to outperform all the previous state-of-the-art algorithms in finding a TMECor, with 182.89, 168.47, 694.44, and 233.98 significant improvements in the different Kuhn Poker and Leduc Poker cases (21K3, 21K4, 21K6 and 21L33). In addition, this work first practically solves the ATMGs in a 5-player case which cannot be conducted by existing algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "Accurately matching local features between a pair of images is a challenging computer vision task. Previous studies typically use attention based graph neural networks (GNNs) with fully-connected graphs over keypoints within/across images for visual and geometric information reasoning. However, in the context of feature matching, considerable keypoints are non-repeatable due to occlusion and failure of the detector, and thus irrelevant for message passing. The connectivity with non-repeatable keypoints not only introduces redundancy, resulting in limited efficiency, but also interferes with the representation aggregation process, leading to limited accuracy. Targeting towards high accuracy and efficiency, we propose MaKeGNN, a sparse attention-based GNN architecture which bypasses non-repeatable keypoints and leverages matchable ones to guide compact and meaningful message passing. More specifically, our Bilateral Context-Aware Sampling Module first dynamically samples two small sets of well-distributed keypoints with high matchability scores from the image pair. Then, our Matchable Keypoint-Assisted Context Aggregation Module regards sampled informative keypoints as message bottlenecks and thus constrains each keypoint only to retrieve favorable contextual information from intra- and inter- matchable keypoints, evading the interference of irrelevant and redundant connectivity with non-repeatable ones. Furthermore, considering the potential noise in initial keypoints and sampled matchable ones, the MKACA module adopts a matchability-guided attentional aggregation operation for purer data-dependent context propagation. By these means, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on relative camera estimation, fundamental matrix estimation, and visual localization, while significantly reducing computational and memory complexity compared to typical attentional GNNs.

Despite many remarkable achievements in recent decades, applying reinforcement learning methods in the real world remains challenging. One of the main obstacles is that reinforcement learning agents lack a fundamental understanding of the world and must therefore learn from scratch through numerous trial-and-error interactions. They may also face challenges in providing explanations for their decisions and generalizing the acquired knowledge. Causality, however, offers a notable advantage as it can formalize knowledge in a systematic manner and leverage invariance for effective knowledge transfer. This has led to the emergence of causal reinforcement learning, a subfield of reinforcement learning that seeks to enhance existing algorithms by incorporating causal relationships into the learning process. In this survey, we comprehensively review the literature on causal reinforcement learning. We first introduce the basic concepts of causality and reinforcement learning, and then explain how causality can address core challenges in non-causal reinforcement learning. We categorize and systematically review existing causal reinforcement learning approaches based on their target problems and methodologies.

Spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) are emerged as powerful predictors and have become the de facto models for learning spatiotemporal representations in recent years. However, existing architectures of STGNNs tend to be complicated by stacking a series of fancy layers. The designed models could be either redundant or enigmatic, which pose great challenges on their complexity and scalability. Such concerns prompt us to re-examine the designs of modern STGNNs and identify core principles that contribute to a powerful and efficient neural predictor. Here we present a compact predictive model that is fully defined by a dense encoder-decoder and a message-passing layer, powered by node identifications, without any complex sequential modules, e.g., TCNs, RNNs, and Transformers. Empirical results demonstrate how a simple and elegant model with proper inductive basis can compare favorably w.r.t. the state of the art with elaborate designs, while being much more interpretable and computationally efficient for spatial-temporal forecasting problem.

    "abstract": "Despite their promising performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, current NLP systems are vulnerable to textual adversarial attacks. To defend against these attacks, most existing methods apply adversarial training by incorporating adversarial examples. However, these methods have to rely on ground-truth labels to generate adversarial examples, rendering it impractical for large-scale model pre-training which is commonly used nowadays for NLP and many other tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel learning framework called SCAT (Self-supervised Contrastive Learning via Adversarial Training), which can learn robust representations without requiring labeled data. Specifically, SCAT modifies random augmentations of the data in a fully labelfree manner to generate adversarial examples. Adversarial training is achieved by minimizing the contrastive loss between the augmentations and their adversarial counterparts. We evaluate SCAT on two text classification datasets using two state-of-the-art attack schemes proposed recently. Our results show that SCAT can not only train robust language models from scratch, but it can also significantly improve the robustness of existing pre-trained language models. Moreover, to demonstrate its flexibility, we show that SCAT can also be combined with supervised adversarial training to further enhance model robustness. ",

In response, various anti-malware systems have been developed to distinguish between different malwares. However, most of the recent malware families are Artificial Intelligence (AI) enable and can deceive traditional anti-malware systems using different obfuscation techniques. Therefore, only AI-enabled anti-malware system is robust against these techniques and can detect different features in the malware files that aid in malicious activities. In this study we review two AI-enabled techniques for detecting malware in Windows and Android operating system, respectively.

    "title": "An Optimal Multiple-Class Encoding Scheme for a Graph of Bounded  Hadwiger Number",
    "abstract": "Since Jacobson [FOCS89] initiated the investigation of succinct graph encodings 35 years ago, there has been a long list of results on balancing the generality of the class, the speed, the succinctness of the encoding, and the query support. Let Cn denote the set consisting of the graphs in a class C that with at most n vertices. A class C is nontrivial if the information-theoretically min number log |Cn| of bits to distinguish the members of Cn is Omega(n). An encoding scheme based upon a single class C is C-opt if it takes a graph G of Cn and produces in deterministic O(n) time an encoded string of at most log |Cn| + o(log |Cn|) bits from which G can be recovered in O(n) time. Despite the extensive efforts in the literature, trees and general graphs were the only nontrivial classes C admitting C-opt encoding schemes that support the degree query in O(1) time. Basing an encoding scheme upon a single class ignores the possibility of a shorter encoded string using additional properties of the graph input. To leverage the inherent structures of individual graphs, we propose to base an encoding scheme upon of multiple classes: An encoding scheme based upon a family F of classes, accepting all graphs in UF, is F-opt if it is C-opt for each C in F. Having a C-opt encoding scheme for each C in F does not guarantee an F-opt encoding scheme. Under this more stringent criterion, we present an F-opt encoding scheme for a family F of an infinite number of classes such that UF comprises all graphs of bounded Hadwiger numbers. F consists of the nontrivial quasi-monotone classes of k-clique-minor-free graphs for each positive integer k. Our F-opt scheme supports queries of degree, adjacency, neighbor-listing, and bounded-distance shortest path in O(1) time per output. We broaden the graph classes admitting opt encoding schemes that also efficiently support fundamental queries. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, ''pre-training and fine-tuning'' has been adopted as a standard workflow for many graph tasks since it can take general graph knowledge to relieve the lack of graph annotations from each application. However, graph tasks with node level, edge level, and graph level are far diversified, making the pre-training pretext often incompatible with these multiple tasks. This gap may even cause a ''negative transfer'' to the specific application, leading to poor results. Inspired by the prompt learning in natural language processing (NLP), which has presented significant effectiveness in leveraging prior knowledge for various NLP tasks, we study the prompting topic for graphs with the motivation of filling the gap between pre-trained models and various graph tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task prompting method for graph models. Specifically, we first unify the format of graph prompts and language prompts with the prompt token, token structure, and inserting pattern. In this way, the prompting idea from NLP can be seamlessly introduced to the graph area. Then, to further narrow the gap between various graph tasks and state-of-the-art pre-training strategies, we further study the task space of various graph applications and reformulate downstream problems to the graph-level task. Afterward, we introduce meta-learning to efficiently learn a better initialization for the multi-task prompt of graphs so that our prompting framework can be more reliable and general for different tasks. We conduct extensive experiments, results from which demonstrate the superiority of our method. ",

Typically, most existing methods begin by constructing a multi-relational DDI graph and then learning relation-aware subgraph embeddings (RaSEs) of drugs from the DDI graph. However, most existing approaches are usually limited in learning RaSEs of new drugs, leading to serious over-fitting when the test DDIs involve such drugs. To alleviate this issue, We propose a novel DDI prediction method based on relation-aware subgraph embedding with co-contrastive learning, RaSECo. RaSECo constructs two heterogeneous drug graphs: a multi-relational DDI graph and a multi-attributes-based drug-drug similarity (DDS) graph. The two graphs are used respectively for learning and propagating the RaSEs of drugs, thereby ensuring that all drugs, including new ones, can aggregate effective RaSEs. Additionally, we employ a cross-view contrastive mechanism to enhance drug-pair (DP) embedding. RaSECo learns DP embeddings from two distinct views (interaction and similarity views) and encourages these views to supervise each other collaboratively to obtain more discriminative DP embeddings. We evaluate the effectiveness of our RaSECo on three different tasks using two real datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that RaSECo outperforms existing state-of-the-art prediction methods. ",

However, self-supervised based federated learning strategies suffer from performance degradation due to label scarcity and diverse data distributions, i.e., data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose the SelfFed framework for Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Our proposed SelfFed framework works in two phases. The first phase is the pre-training paradigm that performs augmentive modeling using Swin Transformer based encoder in a decentralized manner. The first phase of SelfFed framework helps to overcome the data heterogeneity issue. The second phase is the fine-tuning paradigm that introduces contrastive network and a novel aggregation strategy that is trained on limited labeled data for a target task in a decentralized manner. This fine-tuning stage overcomes the label scarcity problem. We perform our experimental analysis on publicly available medical imaging datasets and show that our proposed SelfFed framework performs better when compared to existing baselines concerning non-independent and identically distributed (IID) data and label scarcity. Our method achieves a maximum improvement of 8.8% and 4.1% on Retina and COVID-FL datasets on non-IID dataset. Further, our proposed method outperforms existing baselines even when trained on a few (10%) labeled instances. ",

To fully use the accessible data, recent methods explore suitable measures for the similarity between the query and support images and better high-dimensional features with meta-training and pre-training strategies. However, the potential of multi-modality information has barely been explored, which may bring promising improvement for few-shot classification. In this paper, we propose a Language-guided Prototypical Network (LPN) for few-shot classification, which leverages the complementarity of vision and language modalities via two parallel branches. Concretely, to introduce language modality with limited samples in the visual task, we leverage a pre-trained text encoder to extract class-level text features directly from class names while processing images with a conventional image encoder. Then, a language-guided decoder is introduced to obtain text features corresponding to each image by aligning class-level features with visual features. In addition, to take advantage of class-level features and prototypes, we build a refined prototypical head that generates robust prototypes in the text branch for follow-up measurement. Finally, we aggregate the visual and text logits to calibrate the deviation of a single modality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of LPN against state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. ",

Two new designs of NOMA schemes, namely hybrid successive interference cancellation with power adaptation (HSIC-PA) and fixed successive interference cancellation with power adaptation (FSIC-PA), are proposed. The significant advantages of the proposed schemes are two folds. First, the proposed two schemes can ensure that the secondary users are opportunistically served without degrading the transmission reliability of the primary user. Besides, the transmission robustness of the served secondary users can be guaranteed.

    "abstract": "Deepfakes, malicious visual contents created by generative models, pose an increasingly harmful threat to society. To proactively mitigate deepfake damages, recent studies have employed adversarial perturbation to disrupt deepfake model outputs. However, previous approaches primarily focus on generating distorted outputs based on only predetermined target attributes, leading to a lack of robustness in real-world scenarios where target attributes are unknown. Additionally, the transferability of perturbations between two prominent generative models, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models, remains unexplored. In this paper, we emphasize the importance of target attribute-transferability and model-transferability for achieving robust deepfake disruption. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective disruption method called Latent Ensemble ATtack (LEAT), which attacks the independent latent encoding process. By disrupting the latent encoding process, it generates distorted output images in subsequent generation processes, regardless of the given target attributes. This target attribute-agnostic attack ensures robust disruption even when the target attributes are unknown. Additionally, we introduce a Normalized Gradient Ensemble strategy that effectively aggregates gradients for iterative gradient attacks, enabling simultaneous attacks on various types of deepfake models, involving both GAN-based and Diffusion-based models. Moreover, we demonstrate the insufficiency of evaluating disruption quality solely based on pixel-level differences. As a result, we propose an alternative protocol for comprehensively evaluating the success of defense. Extensive experiments confirm the efficacy of our method in disrupting deepfakes in real-world scenarios, reporting a higher defense success rate compared to previous methods. ",

Many such vehicles currently rely on segmentation and object detection algorithms to detect and track objects around its surrounding. The data collected from the vehicles are often sent to cloud servers to facilitate continual/life-long learning of these algorithms. Considering the bandwidth constraints, the data is compressed before sending it to servers, where it is typically decompressed for training and analysis. In this work, we propose the use of a learning-based compression Codec to reduce the overhead in latency incurred for the decompression operation in the standard pipeline. We demonstrate that the learned compressed representation can also be used to perform tasks like semantic segmentation in addition to decompression to obtain the images. We experimentally validate the proposed pipeline on the Cityscapes dataset, where we achieve a compression factor up to $66 \\times$ while preserving the information required to perform segmentation with a dice coefficient of $0.84$ as compared to $0.88$ achieved using decompressed images while reducing the overall compute by $11\\%$.

Meanwhile, the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation can provide a strong Doppler resilience and facilitates reliable transmission for high-mobility communications. Hence, in this work, we investigate an OTFS-based AirComp system in the presence of time-frequency dual-selective channels. In particular, we commence from the development of a novel transmission framework for the considered system, where the pilot signal is sent together with data and the channel estimation is implemented according to the echo from the access point to the sensor, thereby reducing the overhead of channel state information (CSI) feedback. Hereafter, based on the CSI estimated from the previous frame, a robust precoding matrix aiming at minimizing mean square error in the current frame is designed, which takes into account the estimation error from the receiver noise and the outdated CSI. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed robust precoding scheme by comparing it with the non-robust precoding. The performance gain is more obvious in high signal-to-noise ratio in case of large channel estimation errors. ",

    "abstract": "Harvesting fully ripe tomatoes with mobile robots presents significant challenges in real-world scenarios. These challenges arise from factors such as occlusion caused by leaves and branches, as well as the color similarity between tomatoes and the surrounding foliage during the fruit development stage. The natural environment further compounds these issues with varying light conditions, viewing angles, occlusion factors, and different maturity levels. To overcome these obstacles, this research introduces a novel framework that leverages a convolutional transformer architecture to autonomously recognize and grade tomatoes, irrespective of their occlusion level, lighting conditions, and ripeness. The proposed model is trained and tested using carefully annotated images curated specifically for this purpose. The dataset is prepared under various lighting conditions, viewing perspectives, and employs different mobile camera sensors, distinguishing it from existing datasets such as Laboro Tomato and Rob2Pheno Annotated Tomato. The effectiveness of the proposed framework in handling cluttered and occluded tomato instances was evaluated using two additional public datasets, Laboro Tomato and Rob2Pheno Annotated Tomato, as benchmarks. The evaluation results across these three datasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed framework, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 58.14%, 65.42%, and 66.39% in terms of mean average precision scores for KUTomaData, Laboro Tomato, and Rob2Pheno Annotated Tomato, respectively. The results underscore the superiority of the proposed model in accurately detecting and delineating tomatoes compared to baseline methods and previous approaches. Specifically, the model achieves an F1-score of 80.14%, a Dice coefficient of 73.26%, and a mean IoU of 66.41% on the KUTomaData image dataset. ",

For this, FOLTR trains learning to rank models in an online manner -- i.e. by exploiting users' interactions with the search systems (queries, clicks), rather than labels -- and federatively -- i.e. by not aggregating interaction data in a central server for training purposes, but by training instances of a model on each user device on their own private data, and then sharing the model updates, not the data, across a set of users that have formed the federation. Existing FOLTR methods build upon advances in federated learning. While federated learning methods have been shown effective at training machine learning models in a distributed way without the need of data sharing, they can be susceptible to attacks that target either the system's security or its overall effectiveness. In this paper, we consider attacks on FOLTR systems that aim to compromise their search effectiveness. Within this scope, we experiment with and analyse data and model poisoning attack methods to showcase their impact on FOLTR search effectiveness.

Although a few studies have recently started to focus on the analysis and detection of NFT phishing attacks, NFT phishing attack means are diverse and little has been done to understand these various types of NFT phishing attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to conduct case retrospective analysis and measurement study of real-world historical NFT phishing attacks on Ethereum. By manually analyzing the existing scams reported by Chainabuse, we classify NFT phishing attacks into four patterns. For each pattern, we further investigate the tricks and working principles of them. Based on 469 NFT phishing accounts collected up until October 2022 from multiple channels, we perform a measurement study of on-chain transaction data crawled from Etherscan to characterizing NFT phishing scams by analyzing the modus operandi and preferences of NFT phishing scammers, as well as economic impacts and whereabouts of stolen NFTs. We classify NFT phishing transactions into one of the four patterns by log parsing and transaction record parsing. We find these phishing accounts stole 19,514 NFTs for a total profit of 8,858.431 ETH (around 18.57 million dollars).

While existing methods for hard-coding transformations in neural networks require prior knowledge of the symmetries of the task at hand, this work focuses on discovering and characterizing unknown symmetries present in the dataset, namely, Lie group symmetry transformations beyond the traditional ones usually considered in the field (rotation, scaling, and translation). Specifically, we consider a scenario in which a dataset has been transformed by a one-parameter subgroup of transformations with different parameter values for each data point. Our goal is to characterize the transformation group and the distribution of the parameter values. The results showcase the effectiveness of the approach in both these settings. ",

    "abstract": "As the representation capability of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) improve, there is growing concern that they will inherit social biases from unprocessed corpora. Most previous debiasing techniques used Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) to balance the training corpus. However, CDA slightly modifies the original corpus, limiting the representation distance between different demographic groups to a narrow range. As a result, the debiasing model easily fits the differences between counterfactual pairs, which affects its debiasing performance with limited text resources. In this paper, we propose an adversarial training-inspired two-stage debiasing model using Contrastive learning with Continuous Prompt Augmentation (named CCPA) to mitigate social biases in PLMs' encoding. In the first stage, we propose a data augmentation method based on continuous prompt tuning to push farther the representation distance between sample pairs along different demographic groups. In the second stage, we utilize contrastive learning to pull closer the representation distance between the augmented sample pairs and then fine-tune PLMs' parameters to get debiased encoding. Our approach guides the model to achieve stronger debiasing performance by adding difficulty to the training process. Extensive experiments show that CCPA outperforms baselines in terms of debiasing performance. Meanwhile, experimental results on the GLUE benchmark show that CCPA retains the language modeling capability of PLMs. ",

    "abstract": "Detecting abnormal patterns that deviate from a certain regular repeating pattern in time series is essential in many big data applications. However, the lack of labels, the dynamic nature of time series data, and unforeseeable abnormal behaviors make the detection process challenging. Despite the success of recent deep anomaly detection approaches, the mystical mechanisms in such black-box models have become a new challenge in safety-critical applications. The lack of model transparency and prediction reliability hinders further breakthroughs in such domains. This paper proposes ProtoAD, using prototypes as the example-based explanation for the state of regular patterns during anomaly detection. Without significant impact on the detection performance, prototypes shed light on the deep black-box models and provide intuitive understanding for domain experts and stakeholders. We extend the widely used prototype learning in classification problems into anomaly detection. By visualizing both the latent space and input space prototypes, we intuitively demonstrate how regular data are modeled and why specific patterns are considered abnormal. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models are vulnerable to membership inference attacks (MIAs), which determine whether a given input is used for training the target model. While there have been many efforts to mitigate MIAs, they often suffer from limited privacy protection, large accuracy drop, and/or requiring additional data that may be difficult to acquire. This work proposes a defense technique, HAMP that can achieve both strong membership privacy and high accuracy, without requiring extra data. To mitigate MIAs in different forms, we observe that they can be unified as they all exploit the ML model's overconfidence in predicting training samples through different proxies. This motivates our design to enforce less confident prediction by the model, hence forcing the model to behave similarly on the training and testing samples. HAMP consists of a novel training framework with high-entropy soft labels and an entropy-based regularizer to constrain the model's prediction while still achieving high accuracy. To further reduce privacy risk, HAMP uniformly modifies all the prediction outputs to become low-confidence outputs while preserving the accuracy, which effectively obscures the differences between the prediction on members and non-members. We conduct extensive evaluation on five benchmark datasets, and show that HAMP provides consistently high accuracy and strong membership privacy. Our comparison with seven state-of-the-art defenses shows that HAMP achieves a superior privacy-utility trade off than those techniques. ",

However, recent work pointed out that simple homogeneous graph model without meta-path can also achieve comparable results, which calls into question the necessity of meta-path. In this paper, we first present the intrinsic difference about meta-path-based and meta-path-free models, i.e., how to select neighbors for node aggregation. Then, we propose a novel framework to utilize the rich type semantic information in heterogeneous graphs comprehensively, namely HAGNN (Hybrid Aggregation for Heterogeneous GNNs). The core of HAGNN is to leverage the meta-path neighbors and the directly connected neighbors simultaneously for node aggregations. HAGNN divides the overall aggregation process into two phases: meta-path-based intra-type aggregation and meta-path-free inter-type aggregation. During the intra-type aggregation phase, we propose a new data structure called fused meta-path graph and perform structural semantic aware aggregation on it. Finally, we combine the embeddings generated by each phase. Compared with existing heterogeneous GNN models, HAGNN can take full advantage of the heterogeneity in heterogeneous graphs. Extensive experimental results on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction tasks show that HAGNN outperforms the existing modes, demonstrating the effectiveness of HAGNN. ",

To take advantage of rich information in multiple networks and make better inferences on entities, in this study, we propose random walk on multiple networks, RWM. RWM is flexible and supports both multiplex networks and general multiple networks, which may form many-to-many node mappings between networks. RWM sends a random walker on each network to obtain the local proximity (i.e., node visiting probabilities) w.r.t. the starting nodes. Walkers with similar visiting probabilities reinforce each other. We theoretically analyze the convergence properties of RWM. Two approximation methods with theoretical performance guarantees are proposed for efficient computation. We apply RWM in link prediction, network embedding, and local community detection. Comprehensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of RWM. ",

In contrast to traditional supervised learning, SSL aims to learn representations of data without the need for explicit labels. This is achieved by formulating auxiliary tasks that can be used to create pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data and learn pre-trained models. The pre-trained models can then be fine-tuned on downstream tasks such as remote sensing image scene classification. The paper analyzes the effectiveness of SSL pre-training using Million AID - a large unlabeled remote sensing dataset on various remote sensing image scene classification datasets as downstream tasks. More specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of SSL pre-training using the iBOT framework coupled with Vision transformers (ViT) in contrast to supervised pre-training of ViT using the ImageNet dataset. The comprehensive experimental work across 14 datasets with diverse properties reveals that in-domain SSL leads to improved predictive performance of models compared to the supervised counterparts.

Motivated by this analysis, we propose a non-invariant diffusion model, called $\\textit{SwinGNN}$, which employs an efficient edge-to-edge 2-WL message passing network and utilizes shifted window based self-attention inspired by SwinTransformers. Further, through systematic ablations, we identify several critical training and sampling techniques that significantly improve the sample quality of graph generation. At last, we introduce a simple post-processing trick, $\\textit{i.e.}$, randomly permuting the generated graphs, which provably converts any graph generative model to a permutation-invariant one.

Our analysis allows for infinitely many building blocks in ConvResNeXts, and shows that weight decay implicitly enforces sparsity on these blocks. Specifically, we consider a smooth target function supported on a low-dimensional manifold, then prove that ConvResNeXts can adapt to the function smoothness and low-dimensional structures and efficiently learn the function without suffering from the curse of dimensionality.

This article starts by elaborating on the architectural and algorithmic aspects of SliceOps. Then, the deployed cloud-native SliceOps working is exemplified via a latency-aware resource allocation problem. The deep RL (DRL)-based SliceOps agents within slices provide AI services aiming to allocate optimal radio resources and impede service quality degradation.

However, they still have some limitations. For example, they are generally prone to boundary and mode mixing effects and are not very robust to noise. Inspired by the successful applications of deep learning in fields like image processing and natural language processing, and given the lack in the literature of works in which deep learning techniques are used directly to decompose non-stationary signals into simple oscillatory components, we use the convolutional neural network, residual structure and nonlinear activation function to compute in an innovative way the local average of the signal, and study a new non-stationary signal decomposition method under the framework of deep learning. We discuss the training process of the proposed model and study the convergence analysis of the learning algorithm. In the experiments, we evaluate the performance of the proposed model from two points of view: the calculation of the local average and the signal decomposition. Furthermore, we study the mode mixing, noise interference, and orthogonality properties of the decomposed components produced by the proposed method.

    "abstract": "This paper provides a novel framework for single-domain generalized object detection (i.e., Single-DGOD), where we are interested in learning and maintaining the semantic structures of self-augmented compound cross-domain samples to enhance the model's generalization ability. Different from DGOD trained on multiple source domains, Single-DGOD is far more challenging to generalize well to multiple target domains with only one single source domain. Existing methods mostly adopt a similar treatment from DGOD to learn domain-invariant features by decoupling or compressing the semantic space. However, there may have two potential limitations: 1) pseudo attribute-label correlation, due to extremely scarce single-domain data; and 2) the semantic structural information is usually ignored, i.e., we found the affinities of instance-level semantic relations in samples are crucial to model generalization. In this paper, we introduce Semantic Reasoning with Compound Domains (SRCD) for Single-DGOD. Specifically, our SRCD contains two main components, namely, the texture-based self-augmentation (TBSA) module, and the local-global semantic reasoning (LGSR) module. TBSA aims to eliminate the effects of irrelevant attributes associated with labels, such as light, shadow, color, etc., at the image level by a light-yet-efficient self-augmentation. Moreover, LGSR is used to further model the semantic relationships on instance features to uncover and maintain the intrinsic semantic structures. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SRCD. ",

    "abstract": "K-complexes are an important marker of brain activity and are used both in clinical practice to perform sleep scoring, and in research. However, due to the size of electroencephalography (EEG) records, as well as the subjective nature of K-complex detection performed by somnologists, it is reasonable to automate K-complex detection. Previous works in this field of research have relied on the values of true positive rate and false positive rate to quantify the effectiveness of proposed methods, however this set of metrics may be misleading. The objective of the present research is to find a more accurate set of metrics and use them to develop a new method of K-complex detection, which would not rely on neural networks. Thus, the present article proposes two new methods for K-complex detection based on the fast Fourier transform. The results achieved demonstrated that the proposed methods offered a quality of K-complex detection that is either similar or superior to the quality of the methods demonstrated in previous works, including the methods employing neural networks, while requiring less computational power, meaning that K-complex detection does not require the use of neural networks. The proposed methods were evaluated using a new set of metrics, which is more representative of the quality of K-complex detection. ",

    "abstract": "Indoor localization plays a vital role in applications such as emergency response, warehouse management, and augmented reality experiences. By deploying machine learning (ML) based indoor localization frameworks on their mobile devices, users can localize themselves in a variety of indoor and subterranean environments. However, achieving accurate indoor localization can be challenging due to heterogeneity in the hardware and software stacks of mobile devices, which can result in inconsistent and inaccurate location estimates. Traditional ML models also heavily rely on initial training data, making them vulnerable to degradation in performance with dynamic changes across indoor environments. To address the challenges due to device heterogeneity and lack of adaptivity, we propose a novel embedded ML framework called FedHIL. Our framework combines indoor localization and federated learning (FL) to improve indoor localization accuracy in device-heterogeneous environments while also preserving user data privacy. FedHIL integrates a domain-specific selective weight adjustment approach to preserve the ML model's performance for indoor localization during FL, even in the presence of extremely noisy data. Experimental evaluations in diverse real-world indoor environments and with heterogeneous mobile devices show that FedHIL outperforms state-of-the-art FL and non-FL indoor localization frameworks. FedHIL is able to achieve 1.62x better localization accuracy on average than the best performing FL-based indoor localization framework from prior work. ",

    "abstract": "The $k$-Detour problem is a basic path-finding problem: given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, with specified nodes $s$ and $t$, and a positive integer $k$, the goal is to determine if $G$ has an $st$-path of length exactly $\\text{dist}(s, t) + k$, where $\\text{dist}(s, t)$ is the length of a shortest path from $s$ to $t$. The $k$-Detour problem is NP-hard when $k$ is part of the input, so researchers have sought efficient parameterized algorithms for this task, running in $f(k)\\text{poly}(n)$ time, for $f$ as slow-growing as possible. We present faster algorithms for $k$-Detour in undirected graphs, running in $1.853^k \\text{poly}(n)$ randomized and $4.082^k \\text{poly}(n)$ deterministic time. The previous fastest algorithms for this problem took $2.746^k \\text{poly}(n)$ randomized and $6.523^k \\text{poly}(n)$ deterministic time [Bez\\'akov\\'a-Curticapean-Dell-Fomin, ICALP 2017]. Our algorithms use the fact that detecting a path of a given length in an undirected graph is easier if we are promised that the path belongs to what we call a \"bipartitioned\" subgraph, where the nodes are split into two parts and the path must satisfy constraints on those parts. Previously, this idea was used to obtain the fastest known algorithm for finding paths of length $k$ in undirected graphs [Bj\\\"orklund-Husfeldt-Kaski-Koivisto, JCSS 2017]. Our work has direct implications for the $k$-Longest Detour problem: in this problem, we are given the same input as in $k$-Detour, but are now tasked with determining if $G$ has an $st$-path of length at least $\\text{dist}(s, t) + k.$ Our results for k-Detour imply that we can solve $k$-Longest Detour in $3.432^k \\text{poly}(n)$ randomized and $16.661^k \\text{poly}(n)$ deterministic time.

The slowdown of scaling in CMOS platforms also motivates a search for alternative implementation substrates. In this paper, we present GHOST, the first silicon-photonic hardware accelerator for GNNs. GHOST efficiently alleviates the costs associated with both vertex-centric and edge-centric operations. It implements separately the three main stages involved in running GNNs in the optical domain, allowing it to be used for the inference of various widely used GNN models and architectures, such as graph convolution networks and graph attention networks.

    "abstract": "High-fidelity, data-driven models that can quickly simulate thermal behavior during additive manufacturing (AM) are crucial for improving the performance of AM technologies in multiple areas, such as part design, process planning, monitoring, and control. However, the complexities of part geometries make it challenging for current models to maintain high accuracy across a wide range of geometries. Additionally, many models report a low mean square error (MSE) across the entire domain (part). However, in each time step, most areas of the domain do not experience significant changes in temperature, except for the heat-affected zones near recent depositions. Therefore, the MSE-based fidelity measurement of the models may be overestimated. This paper presents a data-driven model that uses Fourier Neural Operator to capture the local temperature evolution during the additive manufacturing process. In addition, the authors propose to evaluate the model using the $R^2$ metric, which provides a relative measure of the model's performance compared to using mean temperature as a prediction. The model was tested on numerical simulations based on the Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method for the Direct Energy Deposition process, and the results demonstrate that the model achieves high fidelity as measured by $R^2$ and maintains generalizability to geometries that were not included in the training process.

While sequential point cloud has the potential to enhance 3D perception through temporal information, utilizing these temporal features effectively and efficiently remains a challenging problem. Based on the observation that the foreground information is sparsely distributed in LiDAR scenes, we believe sufficient knowledge can be provided by sparse format rather than dense maps. To this end, we propose to learn Significance-gUided Information for 3D Temporal detection (SUIT), which simplifies temporal information as sparse features for information fusion across frames. Specifically, we first introduce a significant sampling mechanism that extracts information-rich yet sparse features based on predicted object centroids. On top of that, we present an explicit geometric transformation learning technique, which learns the object-centric transformations among sparse features across frames. We evaluate our method on large-scale nuScenes and Waymo dataset, where our SUIT not only significantly reduces the memory and computation cost of temporal fusion, but also performs well over the state-of-the-art baselines.

Building on concepts from signed graphs, we introduce a classification of complex-weighted networks based on the notion of structural balance, and illustrate the shared spectral properties within each type. We then apply the results to characterise the dynamics of random walks on complex-weighted networks, where local consensus can be achieved asymptotically when the graph is structurally balanced, while global consensus will be obtained when it is strictly unbalanced. Finally, we explore potential applications of our findings by generalising the notion of cut, and propose an associated spectral clustering algorithm. We also provide further characteristics of the magnetic Laplacian, associating directed networks to complex-weighted ones.

Machine learning (ML) techniques can help connect the physics underlying the process and processing parameters to the clad characteristics. In this study, we introduce a hybrid approach which involves utilizing the data provided by a calibrated multi-physics computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model and experimental research for preparing the essential big dataset, and then uses a comprehensive framework consisting of various ML models to predict and understand clad characteristics. We first compile an extensive dataset by fusing experimental data into the data generated using the developed CFD model for this study. This dataset comprises critical clad characteristics, including geometrical features such as width, height, and depth, labels identifying clad quality, and processing parameters. Second, we use two sets of processing parameters for training the ML models: machine setting parameters and physics-aware parameters, along with versatile ML models and reliable evaluation metrics to create a comprehensive and scalable learning framework for predicting clad geometry and quality. This framework can serve as a basis for clad characteristics control and process optimization. The framework resolves many challenges of conventional modeling methods in MAM by solving t the issue of data scarcity using a hybrid approach and introducing an efficient, accurate, and scalable platform for clad characteristics prediction and optimization.

However, in domains with sensitive information, the release of high-utility data which protects the privacy of individuals has proven challenging. Despite progress in differential privacy and generative modeling for privacy-preserving data release in the literature, only a few approaches optimize for machine learning utility: most approaches only take into account statistical metrics on the data itself and fail to explicitly preserve the loss metrics of machine learning models that are to be subsequently trained on the generated data. In this paper, we introduce a data release framework, 3A (Approximate, Adapt, Anonymize), to maximize data utility for machine learning, while preserving differential privacy. We also describe a specific implementation of this framework that leverages mixture models to approximate, kernel-inducing points to adapt, and Gaussian differential privacy to anonymize a dataset, in order to ensure that the resulting data is both privacy-preserving and high utility. We present experimental evidence showing minimal discrepancy between performance metrics of models trained on real versus privatized datasets, when evaluated on held-out real data. We also compare our results with several privacy-preserving synthetic data generation models (such as differentially private generative adversarial networks), and report significant increases in classification performance metrics compared to state-of-the-art models. These favorable comparisons show that the presented framework is a promising direction of research, increasing the utility of low-risk synthetic data release for machine learning. ",

Further, we analyze the outputs to provide empirical evidence of different parameterizations of tolerance and error bounds for verification. Finally, given that we have the generated an enormous amount of simulated data, we also release a new training dataset called ImageNet-Gen for use in augmenting existing training pipelines. For our results, we show that with a majority vote between three independent verifiers, we can detect image generated perceptual collisions in generated AI with over 99.89% probability and less than 0.0267% chance of intra-class collision. For large language models (LLMs), we are able to gain 100% consensus using greedy methods or n-way beam searches to generate consensus demonstrated on different LLMs. In the context of generative AI training, we pinpoint and minimize the major sources of stochasticity and present gossip and synchronization training techniques for verifiability. Thus, this work provides a practical, solid foundation for AI verification and consensus for the minimization of trust in a decentralized network. ",

It is imperative to have methods in place that can compare different models and identify over-reliances on specific concepts. We consider three well-known abusive language classifiers trained on large English datasets and focus on the concept of negative emotions, which is an important signal but should not be learned as a sufficient feature for the label of abuse. Motivated by the definition of global sufficiency, we first examine the unwanted dependencies learned by the classifiers by assessing their accuracy on a challenge set across all decision thresholds. Further, recognizing that a challenge set might not always be available, we introduce concept-based explanation metrics to assess the influence of the concept on the labels. These explanations allow us to compare classifiers regarding the degree of false global sufficiency they have learned between a concept and a label. ",

    "abstract": "Low-propulsion vessels can take advantage of powerful ocean currents to navigate towards a destination. Recent results demonstrated that vessels can reach their destination with high probability despite forecast errors. However, these results do not consider the critical aspect of safety of such vessels: because of their low propulsion which is much smaller than the magnitude of currents, they might end up in currents that inevitably push them into unsafe areas such as shallow areas, garbage patches, and shipping lanes. In this work, we first investigate the risk of stranding for free-floating vessels in the Northeast Pacific. We find that at least 5.04% would strand within 90 days. Next, we encode the unsafe sets as hard constraints into Hamilton-Jacobi Multi-Time Reachability (HJ-MTR) to synthesize a feedback policy that is equivalent to re-planning at each time step at low computational cost. While applying this policy closed-loop guarantees safe operation when the currents are known, in realistic situations only imperfect forecasts are available. We demonstrate the safety of our approach in such realistic situations empirically with large-scale simulations of a vessel navigating in high-risk regions in the Northeast Pacific. We find that applying our policy closed-loop with daily re-planning on new forecasts can ensure safety with high probability even under forecast errors that exceed the maximal propulsion. Our method significantly improves safety over the baselines and still achieves a timely arrival of the vessel at the destination. ",

Recent work has developed powerful control policies for single agents that can leverage flows to achieve their objectives in dynamic environments. However, in the context of multi-agent systems, these flows can cause agents to collide or drift apart and lose direct inter-agent communications, especially when agents have low propulsion capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Control approach that allows arbitrary single agent performance policies that are unaware of other agents to be used in multi-agent systems, while ensuring safe operation. We first develop a safety controller solely dedicated to avoiding collisions and maintaining inter-agent communication. Subsequently, we design a low-interference safe interaction (LISIC) policy that trades-off the performance policy and the safety controller to ensure safe and optimal operation. Specifically, when the agents are at an appropriate distance, LISIC prioritizes the performance policy, while smoothly increasing the safety controller when necessary. We prove that under mild assumptions on the flows experienced by the agents our approach can guarantee safety. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in realistic settings through an extensive empirical analysis with underactuated Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASV) operating in dynamical ocean currents where the assumptions do not always hold.

Existing methods have long ignored the fact many KGs contain two fundamentally different views: high-level ontology-view concepts and fine-grained instance-view entities. They usually embed all nodes as vectors in one latent space. However, a single geometric representation fails to capture the structural differences between two views and lacks probabilistic semantics towards concepts' granularity. We propose Concept2Box, a novel approach that jointly embeds the two views of a KG using dual geometric representations. We model concepts with box embeddings, which learn the hierarchy structure and complex relations such as overlap and disjoint among them. Box volumes can be interpreted as concepts' granularity. Different from concepts, we model entities as vectors. To bridge the gap between concept box embeddings and entity vector embeddings, we propose a novel vector-to-box distance metric and learn both embeddings jointly. Experiments on both the public DBpedia KG and a newly-created industrial KG showed the effectiveness of Concept2Box. ",

Despite decades of efforts, there is a need for innovative discretization-independent computational methods to predict the evolution of localizations. In this work, an improved version of the neural network-enhanced Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (NN-RKPM) is proposed for modeling brittle fracture. In the proposed method, a background reproducing kernel (RK) approximation defined on a coarse and uniform discretization is enriched by a neural network (NN) approximation under a Partition of Unity framework. In the NN approximation, the deep neural network automatically locates and inserts regularized discontinuities in the function space. The NN-based enrichment functions are then patched together with RK approximation functions using RK as a Partition of Unity patching function. The optimum NN parameters defining the location, orientation, and displacement distribution across location together with RK approximation coefficients are obtained via the energy-based loss function minimization. To regularize the NN-RK approximation, a constraint on the spatial gradient of the parametric coordinates is imposed in the loss function. Analysis of the convergence properties shows that the solution convergence of the proposed method is guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by a series of numerical examples involving damage propagation and branching. ",

    "abstract": "Discrete chemical reaction networks formalize the interactions of molecular species in a well-mixed solution as stochastic events. Given their basic mathematical and physical role, the computational power of chemical reaction networks has been widely studied in the molecular programming and distributed computing communities. While for Turing-universal systems there is a universal measure of optimal information encoding based on Kolmogorov complexity, chemical reaction networks are not Turing universal unless error and unbounded molecular counts are permitted. Nonetheless, here we show that the optimal number of reactions to generate a specific count $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with probability $1$ is asymptotically equal to a ``space-aware'' version of the Kolmogorov complexity of $x$, defined as $\\mathrm{\\widetilde{K}s}(x) = \\min_p\\left\\{\\lvert p \\rvert / \\log \\lvert p \\rvert + \\log(\\texttt{space}(\\mathcal{U}(p))) : \\mathcal{U}(p) = x \\right\\}$, where $p$ is a program for universal Turing machine $\\mathcal{U}$. This version of Kolmogorov complexity incorporates not just the length of the shortest program for generating $x$, but also the space usage of that program. Probability $1$ computation is captured by the standard notion of stable computation from distributed computing, but we limit our consideration to chemical reaction networks obeying a stronger constraint: they ``know when they are done'' in the sense that they produce a special species to indicate completion. As part of our results, we develop a module for encoding and unpacking any $b$ bits of information via $O(b/\\log{b})$ reactions, which is information-theoretically optimal for incompressible information. Our work provides one answer to the question of how succinctly chemical self-organization can be encoded -- in the sense of generating precise molecular counts of species as the desired state. ",

Multi-modal video summarization is one of the approaches utilized to address this issue. Multi-modal video summarization has a video input and a text-based query input. Hence, effective modeling of the interaction between a video input and text-based query is essential to multi-modal video summarization. In this work, a new causality-based method named Causal Video Summarizer (CVS) is proposed to effectively capture the interactive information between the video and query to tackle the task of multi-modal video summarization. The proposed method consists of a probabilistic encoder and a probabilistic decoder. Based on the evaluation of the existing multi-modal video summarization dataset, experimental results show that the proposed approach is effective with the increase of +5.4% in accuracy and +4.92% increase of F 1- score, compared with the state-of-the-art method.

Yet, the interplay between graph topology and feature evolution in GNNs is not well understood. In this paper, we focus on node-wise classification, illustrated with community detection on stochastic block model graphs, and explore the feature evolution through the lens of the \"Neural Collapse\" (NC) phenomenon. When training instance-wise deep classifiers (e.g. for image classification) beyond the zero training error point, NC demonstrates a reduction in the deepest features' within-class variability and an increased alignment of their class means to certain symmetric structures. We start with an empirical study that shows that a decrease in within-class variability is also prevalent in the node-wise classification setting, however, not to the extent observed in the instance-wise case. Then, we theoretically study this distinction. Specifically, we show that even an \"optimistic\" mathematical model requires that the graphs obey a strict structural condition in order to possess a minimizer with exact collapse. Interestingly, this condition is viable also for heterophilic graphs and relates to recent empirical studies on settings with improved GNNs' generalization. Furthermore, by studying the gradient dynamics of the theoretical model, we provide reasoning for the partial collapse observed empirically. Finally, we present a study on the evolution of within- and between-class feature variability across layers of a well-trained GNN and contrast the behavior with spectral methods. ",

Moreover, recent endeavors in 3D shape generation using DIFs often neglect correspondence and topology preservation. This paper presents HNDF (Hybrid Neural Diffeomorphic Flow), a method that implicitly learns the underlying representation and decomposes intricate dense correspondences into explicitly axis-aligned triplane features. To avoid suboptimal representations trapped in local minima, we propose hybrid supervision that captures both local and global correspondences. Unlike conventional approaches that directly generate new 3D shapes, we further explore the idea of shape generation with deformed template shape via diffeomorphic flows, where the deformation is encoded by the generated triplane features. Leveraging a pre-existing 2D diffusion model, we produce high-quality and diverse 3D diffeomorphic flows through generated triplanes features, ensuring topological consistency with the template shape. Extensive experiments on medical image organ segmentation datasets evaluate the effectiveness of HNDF in 3D shape representation and generation. ",

The graph neural network (GNN) can effectively leverage the social relationships between users and achieve excellent results in detecting bots. Recently, more and more GNN-based methods have been proposed for bot detection.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a Multi-scale with Signed-attention Graph Filter for social bot detection called MSGS. MSGS could effectively utilize both high and low-frequency information in the social graph. Specifically, MSGS utilizes a multi-scale structure to produce representation vectors at different scales. These representations are then combined using a signed-attention mechanism. Finally, multi-scale representations via MLP after polymerization to produce the final result. We analyze the frequency response and demonstrate that MSGS is a more flexible and expressive adaptive graph filter. MSGS can effectively utilize high-frequency information to alleviate the over-smoothing problem of deep GNNs.

This innovative method addresses privacy concerns while preserving key dental features, thereby generating valuable resources for dental education and research. Methods: We enhanced the existing GAN Inversion methodology to maximize the preservation of dental characteristics within the synthesized images. A comprehensive technical framework incorporating several deep learning models was developed to provide end-to-end development guidance and practical application for image de-identification. Results: Our approach was assessed with varied facial pictures, extensively used for diagnosing skeletal asymmetry and facial anomalies. Results demonstrated our model's ability to adapt the context from one image to another, maintaining compatibility, while preserving dental features essential for oral diagnosis and dental education. A panel of five clinicians conducted an evaluation on a set of original and GAN-processed images. The generated images achieved effective de-identification, maintaining the realism of important dental features and were deemed useful for dental diagnostics and education. Clinical Significance: Our GAN model and the encompassing framework can streamline the de-identification process of dental patient images, enhancing efficiency in dental education. This method improves students' diagnostic capabilities by offering more exposure to orthodontic malocclusions.

In addition to being simpler and faster, these algorithms, in the monotone submodular case, yield the first deterministic constant factor approximations for various special cases that have been previously considered such as intersection graphs of intervals, disks and pseudo-disks.

    "abstract": "Optimal power flow (OPF) is a fundamental tool for analyzing the characteristics of bipolar DC distribution network (DCDN). However, existing OPF models face challenges in reflecting the power distribution and exchange of bipolar DCDN directly since its decision variables are voltage and current. This paper addresses this issue by establishing a convex OPF model that can be used for the planning and operation of bipolar DCDN. First, the power flow characteristics of bipolar DCDN are revealed through power injection-based equations, upon which the original OPF model is established. Next, the original OPF model undergoes a transformation into a convex OPF model based on second-order cone programming (SOCP) through variable substitution, secondorder cone relaxation, McCormick relaxation, and first-order Taylor expansion, respectively. Finally, the sequence bound tightening algorithm (STBA) is employed to tighten the boundaries of McCormick envelopes in each iteration to ensure the exactness of the convex OPF model. The effectiveness of this novel OPF model for bipolar DCDN is verified through two case studies, i.e., capacity configuration of distributed generation (DG) and operation optimization of bipolar DCDN.

    "abstract": "Power flow analysis plays a crucial role in examining the electricity flow within a power system network. By performing power flow calculations, the system's steady-state variables, including voltage magnitude, phase angle at each bus, active/reactive power flow across branches, can be determined. While the widely used DC power flow model offers speed and robustness, it may yield inaccurate line flow results for certain transmission lines. This issue becomes more critical when dealing with renewable energy sources such as wind farms, which are often located far from the main grid. Obtaining precise line flow results for these critical lines is vital for next operations. To address these challenges, data-driven approaches leverage historical grid profiles. In this paper, a graph neural network (GNN) model is trained using historical power system data to predict power flow outcomes. The GNN model enables rapid estimation of line flows. A comprehensive performance analysis is conducted, comparing the proposed GNN-based power flow model with the traditional DC power flow model, as well as deep neural network (DNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN). The results on test systems demonstrate that the proposed GNN-based power flow model provides more accurate solutions with high efficiency comparing to benchmark models. ",

CNNs are very popular deep-learning models which are used in image classification tasks. However, very powerful and pre-trained CNN models working very accurately on image datasets for image classification tasks may perform disastrously when the networks are under adversarial attacks. In this work, two very well-known adversarial attacks are discussed and their impact on the performance of image classifiers is analyzed.

These attacks are launched on three powerful pre-trained image classifier architectures, ResNet-34, GoogleNet, and DenseNet-161. The classification accuracy of the models in the absence and presence of the two attacks are computed on images from the publicly accessible ImageNet dataset.

In this paper, we propose a novel LiDAR-based terrain modeling approach, which could output stable, complete and accurate terrain models and traversability analysis results. As terrain is an inherent property of the environment that does not change with different view angles, our approach adopts a multi-frame information fusion strategy for terrain modeling. Specifically, a normal distributions transform mapping approach is adopted to accurately model the terrain by fusing information from consecutive LiDAR frames. Then the spatial-temporal Bayesian generalized kernel inference and bilateral filtering are utilized to promote the stability and completeness of the results while simultaneously retaining the sharp terrain edges. Based on the terrain modeling results, the traversability of each region is obtained by performing geometric connectivity analysis between neighboring terrain regions. Experimental results show that the proposed method could run in real-time and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. ",

In this paper, we aim to explore the efficient sampling strategy and contrastive learning in NTMs to address the aforementioned issue. We propose a new sampling assumption that negative samples should contain words that are semantically irrelevant to the prototype. Based on it, we propose the graph contrastive topic model (GCTM), which conducts graph contrastive learning (GCL) using informative positive and negative samples that are generated by the graph-based sampling strategy leveraging in-depth correlation and irrelevance among documents and words. In GCTM, we first model the input document as the document word bipartite graph (DWBG), and construct positive and negative word co-occurrence graphs (WCGs), encoded by graph neural networks, to express in-depth semantic correlation and irrelevance among words. Based on the DWBG and WCGs, we design the document-word information propagation (DWIP) process to perform the edge perturbation of DWBG, based on multi-hop correlations/irrelevance among documents and words. This yields the desired negative and positive samples, which will be utilized for GCL together with the prototypes to improve learning document topic representations and latent topics. We further show that GCL can be interpreted as the structured variational graph auto-encoder which maximizes the mutual information of latent topic representations of different perspectives on DWBG. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for topic coherence and document representation learning compared with existing SOTA methods. ",

Several methods have been introduced to provide insight into the inference process of deep neural networks. However, most of these explainability methods have been shown to be brittle in the face of adversarial perturbations of their inputs in the image and generic textual domain. In this work we show that this phenomenon extends to specific and important high stakes domains like biomedical datasets. In particular, we observe that the robustness of explanations should be characterized in terms of the accuracy of the explanation in linking a model's inputs and its decisions - faithfulness - and its relevance from the perspective of domain experts - plausibility. This is crucial to prevent explanations that are inaccurate but still look convincing in the context of the domain at hand. To this end, we show how to adapt current attribution robustness estimation methods to a given domain, so as to take into account domain-specific plausibility. This results in our DomainAdaptiveAREstimator (DARE) attribution robustness estimator, allowing us to properly characterize the domain-specific robustness of faithful explanations. Next, we provide two methods, adversarial training and FAR training, to mitigate the brittleness characterized by DARE, allowing us to train networks that display robust attributions. Finally, we empirically validate our methods with extensive experiments on three established biomedical benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Like conventional software projects, projects in model-driven software engineering require adequate management of multiple versions of development artifacts, importantly allowing living with temporary inconsistencies. In previous work, multi-version models for model-driven software engineering have been introduced, which allow checking well-formedness and finding merge conflicts for multiple versions of a model at once. However, also for multi-version models, situations where different artifacts, that is, different models, are linked via automatic model transformations have to be handled. In this paper, we propose a technique for jointly handling the transformation of multiple versions of a source model into corresponding versions of a target model, which enables the use of a more compact representation that may afford improved execution time of both the transformation and further analysis operations. Our approach is based on the well-known formalism of triple graph grammars and the aforementioned encoding of model version histories called multi-version models. In addition to batch transformation of an entire model version history, the technique also covers incremental synchronization of changes in the framework of multi-version models. We show the correctness of our approach with respect to the standard semantics of triple graph grammars and conduct an empirical evaluation to investigate the performance of our technique regarding execution time and memory consumption. Our results indicate that the proposed technique affords lower memory consumption and may improve execution time for batch transformation of large version histories, but can also come with computational overhead in unfavorable cases.

Additionally, our proposed approach incorporates sparse dimensional reduction to leverage low-dimensional node features that are relevant to the graph structure. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on real-world graphs. The results demonstrate that our proposed GSL method outperforms several competitive baselines, especially in scenarios where the graph structures are heavily affected by noise. Overall, our research highlights the importance of integrating feature and graph information alignment in GSL, as inspired by our derived theoretical result, and showcases the superiority of our approach in handling noisy graph structures through comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets.

Popular GEC models either use large-scale synthetic corpora or use a large number of human-designed rules. The former is costly to train, while the latter requires quite a lot of human expertise. In recent years, AMR, a semantic representation framework, has been widely used by many natural language tasks due to its completeness and flexibility. A non-negligible concern is that AMRs of grammatically incorrect sentences may not be exactly reliable. In this paper, we propose the AMR-GEC, a seq-to-seq model that incorporates denoised AMR as additional knowledge. Specifically, We design a semantic aggregated GEC model and explore denoising methods to get AMRs more reliable. Experiments on the BEA-2019 shared task and the CoNLL-2014 shared task have shown that AMR-GEC performs comparably to a set of strong baselines with a large number of synthetic data. Compared with the T5 model with synthetic data, AMR-GEC can reduce the training time by 32\\% while inference time is comparable.

    "abstract": "Learning generic high-dimensional tasks is notably hard, as it requires a number of training data exponential in the dimension. Yet, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable success in overcoming this challenge. A popular hypothesis is that learnable tasks are highly structured and that CNNs leverage this structure to build a low-dimensional representation of the data. However, little is known about how much training data they require, and how this number depends on the data structure. This paper answers this question for a simple classification task that seeks to capture relevant aspects of real data: the Random Hierarchy Model. In this model, each of the $n_c$ classes corresponds to $m$ synonymic compositions of high-level features, which are in turn composed of sub-features through an iterative process repeated $L$ times. We find that the number of training data $P^*$ required by deep CNNs to learn this task (i) grows asymptotically as $n_c m^L$, which is only polynomial in the input dimensionality; (ii) coincides with the training set size such that the representation of a trained network becomes invariant to exchanges of synonyms; (iii) corresponds to the number of data at which the correlations between low-level features and classes become detectable. Overall, our results indicate how deep CNNs can overcome the curse of dimensionality by building invariant representations, and provide an estimate of the number of data required to learn a task based on its hierarchically compositional structure.

    "abstract": "In LFSR-based stream ciphers, the knowledge of the feedback equation of the LFSR plays a critical role in most attacks. In word-based stream ciphers such as those in the SNOW series, even if the feedback configuration is hidden, knowing the characteristic polynomial of the state transition matrix of the LFSR enables the attacker to create a feedback equation over $GF(2)$. This, in turn, can be used to launch fast correlation attacks. In this work, we propose a method for hiding both the feedback equation of a word-based LFSR and the characteristic polynomial of the state transition matrix. Here, we employ a $z$-primitive $\\sigma$-LFSR whose characteristic polynomial is randomly sampled from the distribution of primitive polynomials over $GF(2)$ of the appropriate degree. We propose an algorithm for locating $z$-primitive $\\sigma$-LFSR configurations of a given degree. Further, an invertible matrix is generated from the key. This is then employed to generate a public parameter which is used to retrieve the feedback configuration using the key. If the key size is $n$- bits, the process of retrieving the feedback equation from the public parameter has a average time complexity $\\mathbb{O}(2^{n-1})$. The proposed method has been tested on SNOW 2.0 and SNOW 3G for resistance to fast correlation attacks. We have demonstrated that the security of SNOW 2.0 and SNOW 3G increases from 128 bits to 256 bits. ",

However, little concern has been devoted to their robustness during practical deployment. Due to the probabilistic latent structure, variational autoencoders (VAEs) may confront problems such as a mismatch between the posterior distribution of the latent and real data manifold, or discontinuity in the posterior distribution of the latent. This leaves a back door for malicious attackers to collapse VAEs from the latent space, especially in scenarios where the encoder and decoder are used separately, such as communication and compressed sensing. In this work, we provide the first study on the adversarial robustness of generative autoencoders in the latent space. Specifically, we empirically demonstrate the latent vulnerability of popular generative autoencoders through attacks in the latent space. We also evaluate the difference between variational autoencoders and their deterministic variants and observe that the latter performs better in latent robustness. Meanwhile, we identify a potential trade-off between the adversarial robustness and the degree of the disentanglement of the latent codes. Additionally, we also verify the feasibility of improvement for the latent robustness of VAEs through adversarial training. In summary, we suggest concerning the adversarial latent robustness of the generative autoencoders, analyze several robustness-relative issues, and give some insights into a series of key challenges.

Even though a randomized polynomial-time algorithm for this problem was quickly found a few years later, it is still unknown today whether a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm exists. This makes the Exact Matching problem an important candidate to test the RP=P hypothesis. In this paper we focus on approximating Exact Matching. While there exists a simple algorithm that computes in deterministic polynomial-time an almost perfect matching with exactly $k$ red edges, not a lot of work focuses on computing perfect matchings with almost $k$ red edges. In fact such an algorithm for bipartite graphs running in deterministic polynomial-time was published only recently (STACS'23). It outputs a perfect matching with $k'$ red edges with the guarantee that $0.5k \\leq k' \\leq 1.5k$. In the present paper we aim at approximating the number of red edges without exceeding the limit of $k$ red edges. We construct a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm, which on bipartite graphs computes a perfect matching with $k'$ red edges such that $k/3 \\leq k' \\leq k$. ",

    "title": "MAE-DFER: Efficient Masked Autoencoder for Self-supervised Dynamic  Facial Expression Recognition",
    "abstract": "Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) is essential to the development of intelligent and empathetic machines. Prior efforts in this field mainly fall into supervised learning paradigm, which is restricted by the limited labeled data in existing datasets. Inspired by recent unprecedented success of masked autoencoders (e.g., VideoMAE), this paper proposes MAE-DFER, a novel self-supervised method which leverages large-scale self-supervised pre-training on abundant unlabeled data to advance the development of DFER. Since the vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) employed in VideoMAE requires substantial computation during fine-tuning, MAE-DFER develops an efficient local-global interaction Transformer (LGI-Former) as the encoder. LGI-Former first constrains self-attention in local spatiotemporal regions and then utilizes a small set of learnable representative tokens to achieve efficient local-global information exchange, thus avoiding the expensive computation of global space-time self-attention in ViT. Moreover, in addition to the standalone appearance content reconstruction in VideoMAE, MAE-DFER also introduces explicit facial motion modeling to encourage LGI-Former to excavate both static appearance and dynamic motion information. Extensive experiments on six datasets show that MAE-DFER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods by significant margins, verifying that it can learn powerful dynamic facial representations via large-scale self-supervised pre-training. Besides, it has comparable or even better performance than VideoMAE, while largely reducing the computational cost (about 38\\% FLOPs). We believe MAE-DFER has paved a new way for the advancement of DFER and can inspire more relavant research in this field and even other related tasks.

    "abstract": "Centralized data silos are not only becoming prohibitively expensive but also raise issues of data ownership and data availability. These developments are affecting the industry, researchers, and ultimately society in general. Decentralized storage solutions present a promising alternative. Furthermore, such systems can become a crucial layer for new paradigms of edge-centric computing and web3 applications. Decentralized storage solutions based on p2p networks can enable scalable and self-sustaining open-source infrastructures. However, like other p2p systems, they require well-designed incentive mechanisms for participating peers. These mechanisms should be not only effective but also fair in regard to individual participants. Even though several such systems have been studied in deployment, there is still a lack of systematic understanding regarding these issues. We investigate the interplay between incentive mechanisms, network characteristics, and fairness of peer rewards. In particular, we identify and evaluate three core and up-to-date reward mechanisms for moving data in p2p networks: distance-based payments, reciprocity, and time-limited free service. Distance-based payments are relevant since libp2p Kademlia, which enables distance-based algorithms for content lookup and retrieval, is part of various modern p2p systems. We base our model on the Swarm network that uses a combination of the three mechanisms and serves as inspiration for our Tit-for-Token model. We present our Tit-for-Token model and develop a tool to explore the behaviors of these payment mechanisms. Our evaluation provides novel insights into the functioning and interplay of these mechanisms and helps. Based on these insights, we propose modifications to these mechanisms that better address fairness concerns and outline improvement proposals for the Swarm network. ",

    "abstract": "The paradigm of self-supervision focuses on representation learning from raw data without the need of labor-consuming annotations, which is the main bottleneck of current data-driven methods. Self-supervision tasks are often used to pre-train a neural network with a large amount of unlabeled data and extract generic features of the dataset. The learned model is likely to contain useful information which can be transferred to the downstream main task and improve performance compared to random parameter initialization. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervision task called source identification (SI), which is inspired by the classic blind source separation problem. Synthetic images are generated by fusing multiple source images and the network's task is to reconstruct the original images, given the fused images. A proper understanding of the image content is required to successfully solve the task. We validate our method on two medical image segmentation tasks: brain tumor segmentation and white matter hyperintensities segmentation. The results show that the proposed SI task outperforms traditional self-supervision tasks for dense predictions including inpainting, pixel shuffling, intensity shift, and super-resolution. Among variations of the SI task fusing images of different types, fusing images from different patients performs best. ",

    "abstract": "Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to learn progressively about new classes with very few labeled samples, without forgetting the knowledge of already learnt classes. FSCIL suffers from two major challenges: (i) over-fitting on the new classes due to limited amount of data, (ii) catastrophically forgetting about the old classes due to unavailability of data from these classes in the incremental stages. In this work, we propose a self-supervised stochastic classifier (S3C) to counter both these challenges in FSCIL. The stochasticity of the classifier weights (or class prototypes) not only mitigates the adverse effect of absence of large number of samples of the new classes, but also the absence of samples from previously learnt classes during the incremental steps. This is complemented by the self-supervision component, which helps to learn features from the base classes which generalize well to unseen classes that are encountered in future, thus reducing catastrophic forgetting. Extensive evaluation on three benchmark datasets using multiple evaluation metrics show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We also experiment on two additional realistic scenarios of FSCIL, namely where the number of annotated data available for each of the new classes can be different, and also where the number of base classes is much lesser, and show that the proposed S3C performs significantly better than the state-of-the-art for all these challenging scenarios.

So far, most researchers rather studied the accessibility of the whole network or the cost of network disruptions in general, rather than as a function of the accessibility of specific priority destinations like hospitals. Even short delays in accessing healthcare can have significant adverse consequences. We carry out a comprehensive stress test of the entire Austrian road network from this perspective. We simplify the whole network into one consisting of what we call accessibility corridors, deleting single corridors to evaluate the change in accessibility of populations to healthcare. The data created by our stress test was used to generate an importance ranking of the corridors. The findings suggest that certain road segments and corridors are orders of magnitude more important in terms of access to hospitals than the typical one. Our method also highlights vulnerable municipalities and hospitals who may experience demand surges as populations are cut off from their usual nearest hospitals. Even though the skewed importance of some corridors highlights vulnerabilities, they provide policymakers with a clear agenda. ",

However, most existing weight-sharing strategies are solely based on experience or observation, which makes the searching results lack interpretability and rationality. In addition, due to the negligence of fairness, current methods are prone to make misjudgments in module evaluation. To address these problems, we propose a novel neural architecture search algorithm based on dynamical isometry. We use the fix point analysis method in the mean field theory to analyze the dynamics behavior in the steady state random neural network, and how dynamic isometry guarantees the fairness of weight-sharing based NAS. Meanwhile, we prove that our module selection strategy is rigorous fair by estimating the generalization error of all modules with well-conditioned Jacobian. Extensive experiments show that, with the same size, the architecture searched by the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art top-1 validation accuracy on ImageNet classification. In addition, we demonstrate that our method is able to achieve better and more stable training performance without loss of generality. ",

A recently proposed framework for monocular 3D detection based on Pseudo-Stereo has received considerable attention in the community.

In this work, we propose an end-to-end, efficient pseudo-stereo 3D detection framework by introducing a Single-View Diffusion Model (SVDM) that uses a few iterations to gradually deliver right informative pixels to the left image. SVDM allows the entire pseudo-stereo 3D detection pipeline to be trained end-to-end and can benefit from the training of stereo detectors. Afterwards, we further explore the application of SVDM in depth-free stereo 3D detection, and the final framework is compatible with most stereo detectors. Among multiple benchmarks on the KITTI dataset, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance. ",

Despite significant progress, current NIC methods still rely on ConvNet-based entropy coding, limited in modeling long-range dependencies due to their local connectivity and the increasing number of architectural biases and priors, resulting in complex underperforming models with high decoding latency. Motivated by the efficiency investigation of the Tranformer-based transform coding framework, namely SwinT-ChARM, we propose to enhance the latter, as first, with a more straightforward yet effective Tranformer-based channel-wise auto-regressive prior model, resulting in an absolute image compression transformer (ICT). Through the proposed ICT, we can capture both global and local contexts from the latent representations and better parameterize the distribution of the quantized latents. Further, we leverage a learnable scaling module with a sandwich ConvNeXt-based pre-/post-processor to accurately extract more compact latent codes while reconstructing higher-quality images. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets showed that the proposed framework significantly improves the trade-off between coding efficiency and decoder complexity over the versatile video coding (VVC) reference encoder (VTM-18.0) and the neural codec SwinT-ChARM. Moreover, we provide model scaling studies to verify the computational efficiency of our approach and conduct several objective and subjective analyses to bring to the fore the performance gap between the adaptive image compression transformer (AICT) and the neural codec SwinT-ChARM.

We demonstrate this expressive power by deriving the diagrams of various autodiff operations and popular approximations of second-order information with full hyper-parameter support, batching, channel groups, and generalization to arbitrary convolution dimensions. Further, we provide convolution-specific transformations based on the connectivity pattern which allow to re-wire and simplify diagrams before evaluation.

For MAB, the meta-learners initialize and set hyperparameters of the Tsallis-entropy generalization of Exp3, with the task-averaged regret improving if the entropy of the optima-in-hindsight is small. For BLO, we learn to initialize and tune online mirror descent (OMD) with self-concordant barrier regularizers, showing that task-averaged regret varies directly with an action space-dependent measure they induce. Our guarantees rely on proving that unregularized follow-the-leader combined with two levels of low-dimensional hyperparameter tuning is enough to learn a sequence of affine functions of non-Lipschitz and sometimes non-convex Bregman divergences bounding the regret of OMD.

The model has been tested on a real-case scenario of Portuguese addresses and exhibits a high degree of accuracy, exceeding 95% at the door level. When utilized with GPU computations, the inference speed is about 4.5 times quicker than other traditional approaches such as BM25.

In this network, the UAV is equipped with an antenna array, and the $K$ IoT sensors, which are distributed randomly, use single-antenna to communicate. By sending the energy, the UAV as a hybrid access point, charges the sensors and collects information from them. Then, to manage the time and optimize the energy, the sensors are divided into N groups, so that the UAV equipped with multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technology can serve the sensors in a group, during the total time $T$. We provide a simple implementation of the wireless power transfer protocol in the sensors by using the time division multiple access (TDMA) scheme to receive information from the users. In other words, the sensors of each group receive energy from the UAV, when it hovers over the sensors of the previous group, and also when the UAV flies over the previous group to the current group. The sensors of each group send their information to the UAV, when the UAV is hovering over their group. Under these assumptions, we formulate two optimization problems: a sum throughput maximization problem, and a total time minimization problem. Numerical results show that our proposed optimal network provides better performance than the existing networks. In fact, our novel design can serve more sensors at the cost of using more antennas compared to that of the conventional networks. ",

DeLU networks implicitly learn closed-form expressions for the incentive compatibility constraints of the agent and the utility maximization objective of the principal, and support parallel inference on each piece through linear programming or interior-point methods that solve for optimal contracts. We provide empirical results that demonstrate success in approximating the principal's utility function with a small number of training samples and scaling to find approximately optimal contracts on problems with a large number of actions and outcomes.

Such tools are largely context-insensitive and may not cover all possible scenarios in testing potential issues, which makes them susceptible to missing complex security defects. Hence, thorough detection entails a synergistic cooperation between these tools and human-intensive detection techniques, including code review. Code review is widely recognized as a crucial and effective practice for identifying security defects. Aim: This work aims to empirically investigate security defect detection through code review. Method: To this end, we conducted an empirical study by analyzing code review comments derived from four projects in the OpenStack and Qt communities. Through manually checking 20,995 review comments obtained by keyword-based search, we identified 614 comments as security-related. Results: Our results show that (1) security defects are not prevalently discussed in code review, (2) more than half of the reviewers provided explicit fixing strategies/solutions to help developers fix security defects, (3) developers tend to follow reviewers' suggestions and action the changes, (4) Not worth fixing the defect now and Disagreement between the developer and the reviewer are the main causes for not resolving security defects. Conclusions: Our research results demonstrate that (1) software security practices should combine manual code review with automated detection tools, achieving a more comprehensive coverage to identifying and addressing security defects, and (2) promoting appropriate standardization of practitioners' behaviors during code review remains necessary for enhancing software security.

The objective of our study is to provide a thorough analysis of predictive latency within 5G networks by utilizing real-world network data that is accessible to mobile network operators (MNOs). In particular, (i) we present an analytical formulation of the user-plane latency as a Hypoexponential distribution, which is validated by means of a comparative analysis with empirical measurements, and (ii) we conduct experimental results of probabilistic regression, anomaly detection, and predictive forecasting leveraging on emerging domains in Machine Learning (ML), such as Bayesian Learning (BL) and Machine Learning on Graphs (GML). We test our predictive framework using data gathered from scenarios of vehicular mobility, dense-urban traffic, and social gathering events.

The hybrid model uses FE basis functions as a spatial basis and RNNs for the approximation of the time dependencies of the FE basis' degrees of freedom. The training data sets consist of sparse, non-uniformly sampled snapshots of the discrepancy function, pre-computed from trajectory data of low- and high-fidelity dynamic FE models. To account for data sparsity and prevent overfitting, data upsampling and local weighting factors are employed, to instigate a trade-off between physically conforming model behavior and neural network regression. The proposed hybrid modeling methodology is showcased in three highly non-trivial engineering test-cases, all featuring transient FE models, namely, heat diffusion out of a heat sink, eddy-currents in a quadrupole magnet, and sound wave propagation in a cavity. The results show that the proposed hybrid model is capable of approximating model discrepancies to a high degree of accuracy and accordingly correct low-fidelity models. ",

Popular matching strategies include matching to the closest ground truth box (mostly used in combination with anchors), or matching via the Hungarian algorithm (mostly used in anchor-free methods). Each of these strategies comes with its own properties, underlying losses, and heuristics. We show how Unbalanced Optimal Transport unifies these different approaches and opens a whole continuum of methods in between. This allows for a finer selection of the desired properties. Experimentally, we show that training an object detection model with Unbalanced Optimal Transport is able to reach the state-of-the-art both in terms of Average Precision and Average Recall as well as to provide a faster initial convergence. The approach is well suited for GPU implementation, which proves to be an advantage for large-scale models. ",

    "abstract": "Large-scale code generation models such as Codex and CodeT5 have achieved impressive performance. However, libraries are upgraded or deprecated very frequently and re-training large-scale language models is computationally expensive. Therefore, Continual Learning (CL) is an important aspect that remains underexplored in the code domain. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark called CodeTask-CL that covers a wide range of tasks, including code generation, translation, summarization, and refinement, with different input and output programming languages. Next, on our CodeTask-CL benchmark, we compare popular CL techniques from NLP and Vision domains. We find that effective methods like Prompt Pooling (PP) suffer from catastrophic forgetting due to the unstable training of the prompt selection mechanism caused by stark distribution shifts in coding tasks. We address this issue with our proposed method, Prompt Pooling with Teacher Forcing (PP-TF), that stabilizes training by enforcing constraints on the prompt selection mechanism and leads to a 21.54% improvement over Prompt Pooling. Along with the benchmark, we establish a training pipeline that can be used for CL on code models, which we believe can motivate further development of CL methods for code models.

Large amounts of data for training such models benefit the models' performance. However, the size of the data and models results in long training times and high energy consumption. While publishing source code allows for replicability, users need to repeat the expensive training process if models are not shared. The main goal of the study is to investigate if publications that trained language models for software engineering (SE) tasks share source code and trained artifacts. The second goal is to analyze the transparency on training energy usage. We perform a snowballing-based literature search to find publications on language models for source code, and analyze their reusability from a sustainability standpoint. From 494 unique publications, we identified 293 relevant publications that use language models to address code-related tasks. Among them, 27% (79 out of 293) make artifacts available for reuse. This can be in the form of tools or IDE plugins designed for specific tasks or task-agnostic models that can be fine-tuned for a variety of downstream tasks. Moreover, we collect insights on the hardware used for model training, as well as training time, which together determine the energy consumption of the development process. We find that there are deficiencies in the sharing of information and artifacts for current studies on source code models for software engineering tasks, with 40% of the surveyed papers not sharing source code or trained artifacts. We recommend the sharing of source code as well as trained artifacts, to enable sustainable reproducibility. Moreover, comprehensive information on training times and hardware configurations should be shared for transparency on a model's carbon footprint. ",

Efforts to quantify marine pollution are often conducted with sparse and expensive beach surveys, which are difficult to conduct on a large scale. Here, remote sensing can provide reliable estimates of plastic pollution by regularly monitoring and detecting marine debris in coastal areas. Medium-resolution satellite data of coastal areas is readily available and can be leveraged to detect aggregations of marine debris containing plastic litter. In this work, we present a detector for marine debris built on a deep segmentation model that outputs a probability for marine debris at the pixel level. We train this detector with a combination of annotated datasets of marine debris and evaluate it on specifically selected test sites where it is highly probable that plastic pollution is present in the detected marine debris. We demonstrate quantitatively and qualitatively that a deep learning model trained on this dataset issued from multiple sources outperforms existing detection models trained on previous datasets by a large margin. Our experiments show, consistent with the principles of data-centric AI, that this performance is due to our particular dataset design with extensive sampling of negative examples and label refinements rather than depending on the particular deep learning model. We hope to accelerate advances in the large-scale automated detection of marine debris, which is a step towards quantifying and monitoring marine litter with remote sensing at global scales, and release the model weights and training source code under https://github.com/marccoru/marinedebrisdetector ",

We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in improving the segmentation performance using real and synthetic images. Experimental results on the ATLAS 2.0 dataset show that ARHNet outperforms other methods for image harmonization tasks, and boosts the down-stream segmentation performance.

Various studies have demonstrated the efficacy of emerging ML techniques in analysing surgical data, particularly recordings of procedures, for digitizing clinical and non-clinical functions like preoperative planning, context-aware decision-making, and operating skill assessment. However, this field is still in its infancy and lacks representative, well-annotated datasets for training robust models in intermediate ML tasks. Also, existing datasets suffer from inaccurate labels, hindering the development of reliable models. In this paper, we propose a systematic methodology for developing robust models for surgical tool detection using noisy data. Our methodology introduces two key innovations: (1) an intelligent active learning strategy for minimal dataset identification and label correction by human experts; and (2) an assembling strategy for a student-teacher model-based self-training framework to achieve the robust classification of 14 surgical tools in a semi-supervised fashion. Furthermore, we employ weighted data loaders to handle difficult class labels and address class imbalance issues. The proposed methodology achieves an average F1-score of 85.88\\% for the ensemble model-based self-training with class weights, and 80.88\\% without class weights for noisy labels. Also, our proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches, which effectively demonstrates its effectiveness. ",

    "abstract": "False Base Station (FBS) attack has been a severe security problem for the cellular network since 2G era. During handover, the user equipment (UE) periodically receives state information from surrounding base stations (BSs) and uploads it to the source BS. The source BS compares the uploaded signal power and shifts UE to another BS that can provide the strongest signal. An FBS can transmit signal with the proper power and attract UE to connect to it. In this paper, based on the 3GPP standard, a Precheck Sequence-based Detection (PSD) Scheme is proposed to secure the transition of legal base station (LBS) for UE. This scheme first analyzes the structure of received signals in blocks and symbols. Several additional symbols are added to the current signal sequence for verification. By designing a long table of symbol sequence, every UE which needs handover will be allocated a specific sequence from this table. The simulation results show that the performance of this PSD Scheme is better than that of any existing ones, even when a specific transmit power is designed for FBS. ",

Here, we focus on the steady-state performance analysis of protocols for continuous distribution of entanglement. We propose the virtual neighborhood size and the virtual node degree as performance metrics. We utilize the concept of Pareto optimality to formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the performance. As an example, we solve the problem for a quantum network with a tree topology. One of the main conclusions from our analysis is that the entanglement consumption rate has a greater impact on the protocol performance than the fidelity requirements. The metrics that we establish in this manuscript can be utilized to assess the feasibility of entanglement distribution protocols for large-scale quantum networks. ",

    "title": "Smart filter aided domain adversarial neural network: An unsupervised  domain adaptation method for fault diagnosis in noisy industrial scenarios",
    "abstract": "The application of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA)-based fault diagnosis methods has shown significant efficacy in industrial settings, facilitating the transfer of operational experience and fault signatures between different operating conditions, different units of a fleet or between simulated and real data. However, in real industrial scenarios, unknown levels and types of noise can amplify the difficulty of domain alignment, thus severely affecting the diagnostic performance of deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose an UDA method called Smart Filter-Aided Domain Adversarial Neural Network (SFDANN) for fault diagnosis in noisy industrial scenarios. The proposed methodology comprises two steps. In the first step, we develop a smart filter that dynamically enforces similarity between the source and target domain data in the time-frequency domain. This is achieved by combining a learnable wavelet packet transform network (LWPT) and a traditional wavelet packet transform module. In the second step, we input the data reconstructed by the smart filter into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN). To learn domain-invariant and discriminative features, the learnable modules of SFDANN are trained in a unified manner with three objectives: time-frequency feature proximity, domain alignment, and fault classification. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed SFDANN method based on two fault diagnosis cases: one involving fault diagnosis of bearings in noisy environments and another involving fault diagnosis of slab tracks in a train-track-bridge coupling vibration system, where the transfer task involves transferring from numerical simulations to field measurements. Results show that compared to other representative state of the art UDA methods, SFDANN exhibits superior performance and remarkable stability. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the graph induced by the $\\textit{2-swap}$ permutation on words with a fixed Parikh vector. A $2$-swap is defined as a pair of positions $s = (i, j)$ where the word $w$ induced by the swap $s$ on $v$ is $v[1] v[2] \\dots v[i - 1] v[j] v[i+1] \\dots v[j - 1] v[i] v[j + 1] \\dots v[n]$. With these permutations, we define the $\\textit{Configuration Graph}$, $G(P)$ defined over a given Parikh vector. Each vertex in $G(P)$ corresponds to a unique word with the Parikh vector $P$, with an edge between any pair of words $v$ and $w$ if there exists a swap $s$ such that $v \\circ s = w$. We provide several key combinatorial properties of this graph, including the exact diameter of this graph, the clique number of the graph, and the relationships between subgraphs within this graph. Additionally, we show that for every vertex in the graph, there exists a Hamiltonian path starting at this vertex. Finally, we provide an algorithm enumerating these paths from a given input word of length $n$ with a delay of at most $O(\\log n)$ between outputting edges, requiring $O(n \\log n)$ preprocessing.

    "abstract": "Twin-width is a structural width parameter introduced by Bonnet, Kim, Thomass\\'e and Watrigant [FOCS 2020]. Very briefly, its essence is a gradual reduction (a contraction sequence) of the given graph down to a single vertex while maintaining limited difference of neighbourhoods of the vertices, and it can be seen as widely generalizing several other traditional structural parameters. Having such a sequence at hand allows to solve many otherwise hard problems efficiently. Our paper focuses on a comparison of twin-width to the more traditional tree-width on sparse graphs. Namely, we prove that if a graph $G$ of twin-width at most $2$ contains no $K_{t,t}$ subgraph for some integer $t$, then the tree-width of $G$ is bounded by a polynomial function of $t$. As a consequence, for any sparse graph class $\\mathcal{C}$ we obtain a polynomial time algorithm which for any input graph $G \\in \\mathcal{C}$ either outputs a contraction sequence of width at most $c$ (where $c$ depends only on $\\mathcal{C}$), or correctly outputs that $G$ has twin-width more than $2$. On the other hand, we present an easy example of a graph class of twin-width $3$ with unbounded tree-width, showing that our result cannot be extended to higher values of twin-width. ",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous multi-index quantification, segmentation, and uncertainty estimation of liver tumors on multi-modality non-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (NCMRI) are crucial for accurate diagnosis. However, existing methods lack an effective mechanism for multi-modality NCMRI fusion and accurate boundary information capture, making these tasks challenging. To address these issues, this paper proposes a unified framework, namely edge-aware multi-task network (EaMtNet), to associate multi-index quantification, segmentation, and uncertainty of liver tumors on the multi-modality NCMRI. The EaMtNet employs two parallel CNN encoders and the Sobel filters to extract local features and edge maps, respectively. The newly designed edge-aware feature aggregation module (EaFA) is used for feature fusion and selection, making the network edge-aware by capturing long-range dependency between feature and edge maps. Multi-tasking leverages prediction discrepancy to estimate uncertainty and improve segmentation and quantification performance. Extensive experiments are performed on multi-modality NCMRI with 250 clinical subjects. The proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin, achieving a dice similarity coefficient of 90.01$\\pm$1.23 and a mean absolute error of 2.72$\\pm$0.58 mm for MD. The results demonstrate the potential of EaMtNet as a reliable clinical-aided tool for medical image analysis. ",

We show how to systematically reduce the quantum resource requirement of the algorithms by applying variance reduction techniques. Then, we compare the two leading neural quantum state encodings of the state, namely, the Neural Density Operator and the positive operator-valued measurement representation, and illustrate their different performance as the mixedness of the target state varies. We find that certain encodings are more efficient in different regimes of mixedness and point out the need for designing more efficient encodings in terms of both classical and quantum resources. ",

Many existing deep learning-based techniques relying on supervised learning with synthetic images, often underperform on real-world images especially when the number of spectral bands increases. According to the characteristics of the spectral mosaic image, this paper proposes a mosaic loss function, the corresponding model structure, a transformation strategy, and an early stopping strategy, which form a complete unsupervised spectral demosaicing framework. A challenge in real-world spectral demosaicing is inconsistency between the model parameters and the computational resources of the imager. We reduce the complexity and parameters of the spectral attention module by dividing the spectral attention tensor into spectral attention matrices in the spatial dimension and spectral attention vector in the channel dimension, which is more suitable for unsupervised framework. This paper also presents Mosaic25, a real 25-band hyperspectral mosaic image dataset of various objects, illuminations, and materials for benchmarking. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional unsupervised methods in terms of spatial distortion suppression, spectral fidelity, robustness, and computational cost.

Little work has been done integrating various risk factors for depression, to determine the combinations of factors with the greatest utility for identifying which individuals are at the greatest risk. Method: This study demonstrates that data-driven machine learning (ML) methods such as RE-EM (Random Effects/Expectation Maximization) trees and MERF (Mixed Effects Random Forest) can be applied to reliably identify variables that have the greatest utility for classifying subgroups at greatest risk for depression. 185 young adults completed measures of depression risk, including rumination, worry, negative cognitive styles, cognitive and coping flexibilities, and negative life events, along with symptoms of depression. We trained RE-EM trees and MERF algorithms and compared them to traditional linear mixed models (LMMs) predicting depressive symptoms prospectively and concurrently with cross-validation. Results: Our results indicated that the RE-EM tree and MERF methods model complex interactions, identify subgroups of individuals and predict depression severity comparable to LMM. Further, machine learning models determined that brooding, negative life events, negative cognitive styles, and perceived control were the most relevant predictors of future depression levels. Conclusions: Random effects machine learning models have the potential for high clinical utility and can be leveraged for interventions to reduce vulnerability to depression. ",

A key step in the proof is the use of Von Neumman's trace inequality. Previous works provided exact solutions for rank-one SSV when the uncertainty contains repeated (real or complex) scalars and/or non-repeated complex full-block uncertainties. Our result with repeated complex full-blocks contains, as special cases, the previous results for repeated complex scalars and/or non-repeated complex full-block uncertainties. The repeated complex full-block uncertainty has recently gained attention in the context of incompressible fluid flows. Specifically, it has been used to analyze the effect of the convective nonlinearity in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation (NSE). SSV analysis with repeated full-block uncertainty has led to an improved understanding of the underlying flow physics. We demonstrate our method on a turbulent channel flow model as an example. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reflects information about human tissue from different perspectives and has many clinical applications. By utilizing the complementary information among different modalities, multi-contrast super-resolution (SR) of MRI can achieve better results than single-image super-resolution. However, existing methods of multi-contrast MRI SR have the following shortcomings that may limit their performance: First, existing methods either simply concatenate the reference and degraded features or exploit global feature-matching between them, which are unsuitable for multi-contrast MRI SR. Second, although many recent methods employ transformers to capture long-range dependencies in the spatial dimension, they neglect that self-attention in the channel dimension is also important for low-level vision tasks. To address these shortcomings, we proposed a novel network architecture with compound-attention and neighbor matching (CANM-Net) for multi-contrast MRI SR: The compound self-attention mechanism effectively captures the dependencies in both spatial and channel dimension; the neighborhood-based feature-matching modules are exploited to match degraded features and adjacent reference features and then fuse them to obtain the high-quality images. We conduct experiments of SR tasks on the IXI, fastMRI, and real-world scanning datasets. The CANM-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both retrospective and prospective experiments. Moreover, the robustness study in our work shows that the CANM-Net still achieves good performance when the reference and degraded images are imperfectly registered, proving good potential in clinical applications.

While these two types of models have shown great success, they suffer from respective limitations that hinder them from achieving fast sampling and high sample quality simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a unified theoretic framework for SDMs and GANs. We shown that: i) the learning dynamics of both SDMs and GANs can be described as a novel SDE named Discriminator Denoising Diffusion Flow (DiffFlow) where the drift can be determined by some weighted combinations of scores of the real data and the generated data; ii) By adjusting the relative weights between different score terms, we can obtain a smooth transition between SDMs and GANs while the marginal distribution of the SDE remains invariant to the change of the weights; iii) we prove the asymptotic optimality and maximal likelihood training scheme of the DiffFlow dynamics; iv) under our unified theoretic framework, we introduce several instantiations of the DiffFLow that provide new algorithms beyond GANs and SDMs with exact likelihood inference and have potential to achieve flexible trade-off between high sample quality and fast sampling speed.

In this setting, we tackle the case of low Tikhonov regularization, resulting in potentially non-convex cost landscapes. While the global results obtained for high Tikhonov regularization may not hold globally, we show that many of them can be recovered in regions where the loss function is locally convex. Inspired by our theoretical findings, we develop a training method tailored to this specific type of Autoencoders with residual connections, and we validate our approach through numerical experiments conducted on various examples.

More specifically, we study the order-to-chaos transition in the fully-connected feedforward neural networks and the convolutional ones to show that (i) there is a well-defined transition from the ordered state to the chaotics state even for the finite networks, and (ii) difference in architecture is reflected in that of the universality class of the transition. Remarkably, the finite-size scaling can also be successfully applied, indicating that intuitive phenomenological argument could lead us to semi-quantitative description of the signal propagation dynamics.

We then focus on two code transformation techniques: $\\textit{code morphing}$, a procedure that transforms a code while retaining its fault-tolerant gates, and $\\textit{gauge fixing}$, where complimentary codes can be obtained from a common subsystem code (e.g., the Steane and the quantum Reed-Muller codes from the [[15,1,3,3]] code).
