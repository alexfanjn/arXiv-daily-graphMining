    "title": "Adaptive Graph Convolution Networks for Traffic Flow Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Traffic flow forecasting is a highly challenging task due to the dynamic spatial-temporal road conditions. Graph neural networks (GNN) has been widely applied in this task. However, most of these GNNs ignore the effects of time-varying road conditions due to the fixed range of the convolution receptive field. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Graph Convolution Networks (AGC-net) to address this issue in GNN. The AGC-net is constructed by the Adaptive Graph Convolution (AGC) based on a novel context attention mechanism, which consists of a set of graph wavelets with various learnable scales. The AGC transforms the spatial graph representations into time-sensitive features considering the temporal context. Moreover, a shifted graph convolution kernel is designed to enhance the AGC, which attempts to correct the deviations caused by inaccurate topology. Experimental results on two public traffic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the AGC-net\\footnote{Code is available at: https://github.com/zhengdaoli/AGC-net} which outperforms other baseline models significantly.

    "title": "On Pseudolinear Codes for Correcting Adversarial Errors",
    "abstract": "We consider error-correction coding schemes for adversarial wiretap channels (AWTCs) in which the channel can a) read a fraction of the codeword bits up to a bound $r$ and b) flip a fraction of the bits up to a bound $p$. The channel can freely choose the locations of the bit reads and bit flips via a process with unbounded computational power. Codes for the AWTC are of broad interest in the area of information security, as they can provide data resiliency in settings where an attacker has limited access to a storage or transmission medium. We investigate a family of non-linear codes known as pseudolinear codes, which were first proposed by Guruswami and Indyk (FOCS 2001) for constructing list-decodable codes independent of the AWTC setting. Unlike general non-linear codes, pseudolinear codes admit efficient encoders and have succinct representations. We focus on unique decoding and show that random pseudolinear codes can achieve rates up to the binary symmetric channel (BSC) capacity $1-H_2(p)$ for any $p,r$ in the less noisy region: $p<1/2$ and $r<1-H_2(p)$ where $H_2(\\cdot)$ is the binary entropy function. Thus, pseudolinear codes are the first known optimal-rate binary code family for the less noisy AWTC that admit efficient encoders. The above result can be viewed as a derandomization result of random general codes in the AWTC setting, which in turn opens new avenues for applying derandomization techniques to randomized constructions of AWTC codes. Our proof applies a novel concentration inequality for sums of random variables with limited independence which may be of interest as an analysis tool more generally. ",

    "abstract": "Ribozymes, RNA molecules with distinct 3D structures and catalytic activity, have widespread applications in synthetic biology and therapeutics. However, relatively little research has focused on leveraging deep learning to enhance our understanding of ribozymes. This study implements Word2Vec, an unsupervised learning technique for natural language processing, to learn ribozyme embeddings. Ribo2Vec was trained on over 9,000 diverse ribozymes, learning to map sequences to 128 and 256-dimensional vector spaces. Using Ribo2Vec, sequence embeddings for five classes of ribozymes (hatchet, pistol, hairpin, hovlinc, and twister sister) were calculated. Principal component analysis demonstrated the ability of these embeddings to distinguish between ribozyme classes. Furthermore, a simple SVM classifier trained on ribozyme embeddings showed promising results in accurately classifying ribozyme types. Our results suggest that the embedding vectors contained meaningful information about ribozymes. Interestingly, 256-dimensional embeddings behaved similarly to 128-dimensional embeddings, suggesting that a lower dimension vector space is generally sufficient to capture ribozyme features. This approach demonstrates the potential of Word2Vec for bioinformatics, opening new avenues for ribozyme research. Future research includes using a Transformer-based method to learn RNA embeddings, which can capture long-range interactions between nucleotides. ",

    "abstract": "Despite the impressive performance obtained by recent single-image hand modeling techniques, they lack the capability to capture sufficient details of the 3D hand mesh. This deficiency greatly limits their applications when high-fidelity hand modeling is required, e.g., personalized hand modeling. To address this problem, we design a frequency split network to generate 3D hand mesh using different frequency bands in a coarse-to-fine manner. To capture high-frequency personalized details, we transform the 3D mesh into the frequency domain, and propose a novel frequency decomposition loss to supervise each frequency component. By leveraging such a coarse-to-fine scheme, hand details that correspond to the higher frequency domain can be preserved. In addition, the proposed network is scalable, and can stop the inference at any resolution level to accommodate different hardware with varying computational powers. To quantitatively evaluate the performance of our method in terms of recovering personalized shape details, we introduce a new evaluation metric named Mean Signal-to-Noise Ratio (MSNR) to measure the signal-to-noise ratio of each mesh frequency component. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach generates fine-grained details for high-fidelity 3D hand reconstruction, and our evaluation metric is more effective for measuring mesh details compared with traditional metrics.

    "title": "Robust Routing Made Easy: Reinforcing Networks Against Non-Benign Faults",
    "abstract": "With the increasing scale of communication networks, the likelihood of failures grows as well. Since these networks form a critical backbone of our digital society, it is important that they rely on robust routing algorithms which ensure connectivity despite such failures. While most modern communication networks feature robust routing mechanisms, these mechanisms are often fairly complex to design and verify, as they need to account for the effects of failures and rerouting on communication. This paper conceptualizes the design of robust routing mechanisms, with the aim to avoid such complexity. In particular, we showcase \\emph{simple} and generic blackbox transformations that increase resilience of routing against independently distributed failures, which allows to simulate the routing scheme on the original network, even in the presence of non-benign node failures (henceforth called faults). This is attractive as the system specification and routing policy can simply be preserved. We present a scheme for constructing such a reinforced network, given an existing (synchronous) network and a routing scheme. We prove that this algorithm comes with small constant overheads, and only requires a minimal amount of additional node and edge resources; in fact, if the failure probability is smaller than $1/n$, the algorithm can come without any overhead at all. At the same time, it allows to tolerate a large number of independent random (node) faults, asymptotically almost surely. We complement our analytical results with simulations on different real-world topologies. ",

In the human cardiovascular system, such devices are envisioned to be passively flowing and continuously sensing for detecting events of diagnostic interest. The diagnostic value of detecting such events can be enhanced by assigning to them their physical locations (e.g., body region), which is the main proposition of flow-guided localization. Current flow-guided localization approaches suffer from low localization accuracy and they are by-design unable to localize events within the entire cardiovascular system. Toward addressing this issue, we propose the utilization of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for this purpose, and demonstrate localization accuracy and coverage enhancements of our proposal over the existing State of the Art (SotA) approaches. Based on our evaluation, we provide several design guidelines for GNN-enabled flow-guided localization. ",

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based approaches for pose estimation have been previously introduced. However, the quest for better performance still persists especially for accurate robotics manipulation. This quest extends to the Agri-robotics domain. In this paper, we propose TransPose, an improved Transformer-based 6D pose estimation with a depth refinement module. The architecture takes in only an RGB image as input with no additional supplementing modalities such as depth or thermal images. The architecture encompasses an innovative lighter depth estimation network that estimates depth from an RGB image using feature pyramid with an up-sampling method. A transformer-based detection network with additional prediction heads is proposed to directly regress the object's centre and predict the 6D pose of the target. A novel depth refinement module is then used alongside the predicted centers, 6D poses and depth patches to refine the accuracy of the estimated 6D pose. We extensively compared our results with other state-of-the-art methods and analysed our results for fruit-picking applications. The results we achieved show that our proposed technique outperforms the other methods available in the literature. ",

Our preliminary study shows that the simple approach of matching candidate images with the phrase using CLIP suffers from the many-to-many nature of image-text pairs. We find that the CLIP text encoder may have limited abilities in capturing the compositionality in natural language. Conversely, the descriptive focus of the phrase varies from instance to instance. We address these issues in our two systems, Augment-CLIP and Stable Diffusion Sampling (SD Sampling). Augment-CLIP augments the text prompt by generating sentences that contain the context phrase with the help of large language models (LLMs). We further explore CLIP models in other languages, as the an ambiguous word may be translated into an unambiguous one in the other language. SD Sampling uses text-to-image Stable Diffusion to generate multiple images from the given phrase, increasing the likelihood that a subset of images match the one that paired with the text. ",

    "abstract": "The fast spread of hate speech on social media impacts the Internet environment and our society by increasing prejudice and hurting people. Detecting hate speech has aroused broad attention in the field of natural language processing. Although hate speech detection has been addressed in recent work, this task still faces two inherent unsolved challenges. The first challenge lies in the complex semantic information conveyed in hate speech, particularly the interference of insulting words in hate speech detection. The second challenge is the imbalanced distribution of hate speech and non-hate speech, which may significantly deteriorate the performance of models. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel dual contrastive learning (DCL) framework for hate speech detection. Our framework jointly optimizes the self-supervised and the supervised contrastive learning loss for capturing span-level information beyond the token-level emotional semantics used in existing models, particularly detecting speech containing abusive and insulting words. Moreover, we integrate the focal loss into the dual contrastive learning framework to alleviate the problem of data imbalance. We conduct experiments on two publicly available English datasets, and experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models and precisely detects hate speeches.

Currently, the implementation of data-driven engineering relies on fundamental data science and software engineering skills.

In previous work, a model-based engineering approach integrating the formalization of machine learning tasks using the general-purpose modeling language SysML is presented. However, formalized machine learning tasks still require the implementation in a specialized programming languages like Python. Therefore, this work aims to facilitate the implementation of data-driven engineering in practice by extending the previous work of formalizing machine learning tasks by integrating model transformation to generate executable code. The method focuses on the modifiability and maintainability of the model transformation so that extensions and changes to the code generation can be integrated without requiring modifications to the code generator. The presented method is evaluated for feasibility in a case study to predict weather forecasts. Based thereon, quality attributes of model transformations are assessed and discussed. Results demonstrate the flexibility and the simplicity of the method reducing efforts for implementation. Further, the work builds a theoretical basis for standardizing data-driven engineering implementation in practice. ",

In order to assist with efficient computation of MPT spectral signatures of different objects to enable the construction of large dictionaries of characterisations for classification approaches, this work proposes a new, highly-efficient, strategy for predicting MPT coefficients. This is achieved by solving an eddy current type problem using hp-finite elements in combination with a proper orthogonal decomposition reduced order modelling (ROM) methodology and offers considerable computational savings over our previous approach. Furthermore, an adaptive approach is described for generating new frequency snapshots to further improve the accuracy of the ROM. To improve the resolution of highly conducting and magnetic objects, a recipe is proposed to choose the number and thicknesses of prismatic boundary layers for accurate resolution of thin skin depths in such problems. The paper includes a series of challenging examples to demonstrate the success of the proposed methodologies. ",

Better understanding the non-semantic information in popular embeddings (e.g., MAE, SimCLR, or CLIP) will shed new light both on the training algorithms and on the uses for these foundation models. We design a systematic transformation prediction task and measure the visual content of embeddings along many axes, including image style, quality, and a range of natural and artificial transformations. Surprisingly, six embeddings (including SimCLR) encode enough non-semantic information to identify dozens of transformations. We also consider a generalization task, where we group similar transformations and hold out several for testing. We find that image-text models (CLIP and ALIGN) are better at recognizing new examples of style transfer than masking-based models (CAN and MAE).

Most existing methods tend to model the correlation between history trajectory (input) and future trajectory (output). Since correlation is just a superficial description of reality, these methods rely heavily on the i.i.d. assumption and evince a heightened susceptibility to out-of-distribution data. To address this problem, we propose an Out-of- Distribution Causal Graph (OOD-CG), which explicitly defines the underlying causal structure of the data with three entangled latent features: 1) domain-invariant causal feature (IC), 2) domain-variant causal feature (VC), and 3) domain-variant non-causal feature (VN ). While these features are confounded by confounder (C) and domain selector (D). To leverage causal features for prediction, we propose a Causal Inspired Learning Framework (CILF), which includes three steps: 1) extracting domain-invariant causal feature by means of an invariance loss, 2) extracting domain variant feature by domain contrastive learning, and 3) separating domain-variant causal and non-causal feature by encouraging causal sufficiency. We evaluate the performance of CILF in different vehicle trajectory prediction models on the mainstream datasets NGSIM and INTERACTION. Experiments show promising improvements in CILF on domain generalization. ",

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph completion (KGC) is the task of inferencing missing facts from any given knowledge graphs (KG). Previous KGC methods typically represent knowledge graph entities and relations as trainable continuous embeddings and fuse the embeddings of the entity $h$ (or $t$) and relation $r$ into hidden representations of query $(h, r, ?)$ (or $(?, r, t$)) to approximate the missing entities. To achieve this, they either use shallow linear transformations or deep convolutional modules. However, the linear transformations suffer from the expressiveness issue while the deep convolutional modules introduce unnecessary inductive bias, which could potentially degrade the model performance. Thus, we propose a novel Transformer-based Patch Refinement Model (PatReFormer) for KGC. PatReFormer first segments the embedding into a sequence of patches and then employs cross-attention modules to allow bi-directional embedding feature interaction between the entities and relations, leading to a better understanding of the underlying KG. We conduct experiments on four popular KGC benchmarks, WN18RR, FB15k-237, YAGO37 and DB100K. The experimental results show significant performance improvement from existing KGC methods on standard KGC evaluation metrics, e.g., MRR and H@n. Our analysis first verifies the effectiveness of our model design choices in PatReFormer. We then find that PatReFormer can better capture KG information from a large relation embedding dimension. Finally, we demonstrate that the strength of PatReFormer is at complex relation types, compared to other KGC models ",

    "title": "Transaction Fraud Detection via an Adaptive Graph Neural Network",
    "abstract": "Many machine learning methods have been proposed to achieve accurate transaction fraud detection, which is essential to the financial security of individuals and banks. However, most existing methods leverage original features only or require manual feature engineering. They lack the ability to learn discriminative representations from transaction data. Moreover, criminals often commit fraud by imitating cardholders' behaviors, which causes the poor performance of existing detection models. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Sampling and Aggregation-based Graph Neural Network (ASA-GNN) that learns discriminative representations to improve the performance of transaction fraud detection. A neighbor sampling strategy is performed to filter noisy nodes and supplement information for fraudulent nodes. Specifically, we leverage cosine similarity and edge weights to adaptively select neighbors with similar behavior patterns for target nodes and then find multi-hop neighbors for fraudulent nodes. A neighbor diversity metric is designed by calculating the entropy among neighbors to tackle the camouflage issue of fraudsters and explicitly alleviate the over-smoothing phenomena. Extensive experiments on three real financial datasets demonstrate that the proposed method ASA-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art ones. ",

    "abstract": "Most real-world 3D measurements from depth sensors are incomplete, and to address this issue the point cloud completion task aims to predict the complete shapes of objects from partial observations. Previous works often adapt an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder is trained to extract embeddings that are used as inputs to generate predictions from the decoder. However, the learned embeddings have sparse distribution in the feature space, which leads to worse generalization results during testing. To address these problems, this paper proposes a hyperspherical module, which transforms and normalizes embeddings from the encoder to be on a unit hypersphere. With the proposed module, the magnitude and direction of the output hyperspherical embedding are decoupled and only the directional information is optimized. We theoretically analyze the hyperspherical embedding and show that it enables more stable training with a wider range of learning rates and more compact embedding distributions. Experiment results show consistent improvement of point cloud completion in both single-task and multi-task learning, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "We carry out an information-theoretical analysis of a two-layer neural network trained from input-output pairs generated by a teacher network with matching architecture, in overparametrized regimes. Our results come in the form of bounds relating i) the mutual information between training data and network weights, or ii) the Bayes-optimal generalization error, to the same quantities but for a simpler (generalized) linear model for which explicit expressions are rigorously known. Our bounds, which are expressed in terms of the number of training samples, input dimension and number of hidden units, thus yield fundamental performance limits for any neural network (and actually any learning procedure) trained from limited data generated according to our two-layer teacher neural network model. The proof relies on rigorous tools from spin glasses and is guided by ``Gaussian equivalence principles'' lying at the core of numerous recent analyses of neural networks. With respect to the existing literature, which is either non-rigorous or restricted to the case of the learning of the readout weights only, our results are information-theoretic (i.e. are not specific to any learning algorithm) and, importantly, cover a setting where all the network parameters are trained.

    "abstract": "Automating the monitoring of industrial processes has the potential to enhance efficiency and optimize quality by promptly detecting abnormal events and thus facilitating timely interventions. Deep learning, with its capacity to discern non-trivial patterns within large datasets, plays a pivotal role in this process. Standard deep learning methods are suitable to solve a specific task given a specific type of data. During training, the algorithms demand large volumes of labeled training data. However, due to the dynamic nature of processes and the environment, it is impractical to acquire the needed data for standard deep learning training for every slightly different case anew. Deep transfer learning offers a solution to this problem. By leveraging knowledge from related tasks and accounting for variations in data distributions, this learning framework solves new tasks even with little or no additional labeled data. The approach bypasses the need to retrain a model from scratch for every new setup and dramatically reduces the labeled data requirement. This survey provides an in-depth review of deep transfer learning, examining the problem settings of transfer learning and classifying the prevailing deep transfer learning methods. Moreover, we delve into applying deep transfer learning in the context of a broad spectrum of time series anomaly detection tasks prevalent in primary industrial domains, e.g., manufacturing process monitoring, predictive maintenance, energy management, and infrastructure facility monitoring. We conclude this survey by underlining the challenges and limitations of deep transfer learning in industrial contexts. We also provide practical directions for solution design and implementation for these tasks, leading to specific, actionable suggestions. ",

    "abstract": "Providing a model that achieves a strong predictive performance and at the same time is interpretable by humans is one of the most difficult challenges in machine learning research due to the conflicting nature of these two objectives. To address this challenge, we propose a modification of the Radial Basis Function Neural Network model by equipping its Gaussian kernel with a learnable precision matrix. We show that precious information is contained in the spectrum of the precision matrix that can be extracted once the training of the model is completed. In particular, the eigenvectors explain the directions of maximum sensitivity of the model revealing the active subspace and suggesting potential applications for supervised dimensionality reduction. At the same time, the eigenvectors highlight the relationship in terms of absolute variation between the input and the latent variables, thereby allowing us to extract a ranking of the input variables based on their importance to the prediction task enhancing the model interpretability. We conducted numerical experiments for regression, classification, and feature selection tasks, comparing our model against popular machine learning models and the state-of-the-art deep learning-based embedding feature selection techniques. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model does not only yield an attractive prediction performance with respect to the competitors but also provides meaningful and interpretable results that potentially could assist the decision-making process in real-world applications.

Causal representation learning (CRL), however, argues that factors of variation in a dataset are, in fact, causally related. Allowing latent variables to be correlated, as a consequence of causal relationships, is more realistic and generalisable. So far, provably identifiable methods rely on: auxiliary information, weak labels, and interventional or even counterfactual data. Inspired by causal discovery with functional causal models, we propose a fully unsupervised representation learning method that considers a data generation process with a latent additive noise model (ANM).

By leveraging this capability, our framework enables personalized and accurate job recommendations for individual users. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a comprehensive dataset and demonstrate its ability to improve the relevance and quality of recommended quality. This research not only sheds light on the untapped potential of large language models but also provides valuable insights for developing advanced recommendation systems in the recruitment market.

We present algorithms and a runtime system for identifying and executing the most efficient loop nest for any SpTTN kernel. We consider both enumeration of such loop nests for autotuning and efficient algorithms for finding the lowest cost loop-nest for simpler metrics, such as buffer size or cache miss models. Our runtime system identifies the best choice of loop nest without user guidance, and also provides a distributed-memory parallelization of SpTTN kernels.

We approach this classic question from a continual learning perspective, in which we aim to continue fine-tuning models trained on past tasks on new tasks, with the goal of \"transferring\" relevant knowledge. However, this strategy also runs the risk of doing more harm than good, i.e., negative transfer. In this paper, we construct a new benchmark of task sequences that target different possible transfer scenarios one might face, such as a sequence of tasks with high potential of positive transfer, high potential for negative transfer, no expected effect, or a mixture of each. An ideal learner should be able to maximally exploit information from all tasks that have any potential for positive transfer, while also avoiding the negative effects of any distracting tasks that may confuse it. We then propose a simple, yet effective, learner that satisfies many of our desiderata simply by leveraging a selective strategy for initializing new models from past task checkpoints. Still, limitations remain, and we hope this benchmark can help the community to further build and analyze such learners. ",

Formal methods operates efficiently in protocol-level abstract specification models, and fuzz testing offers comprehensive experimental evaluation of system implementations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages the respective advantages and coverage of both formal and fuzzing methods to efficiently detect vulnerabilities from protocol logic to implementation stacks hierarchically. The detected attack traces from the formal verification results in critical protocols guide the case generation of fuzz testing, and the feedbacks from fuzz testing further broaden the scope of the formal verification. We examine the proposed framework with the 5G Non Standard-Alone (NSA) security processes, focusing on the Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection process. We first identify protocol-level vulnerabilities of user credentials via formal methods. Following this, we implement bit-level fuzzing to evaluate potential impacts and risks of integrity-vulnerable identifier variation. Concurrently, we conduct command-level mutation-based fuzzing by fixing the assumption identifier to assess the potential impacts and risks of confidentiality-vulnerable identifiers. During this approach, we established 1 attack model and detected 53 vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities identified used to fortify protocol-level assumptions could further refine search space for the following detection cycles. Consequently, it addresses the prevalent scalability challenges in detecting vulnerabilities and unintended emergent behaviors in large-scale systems in 5G and beyond. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel Random-Set Convolutional Neural Network (RS-CNN) for classification which predicts belief functions rather than probability vectors over the set of classes, using the mathematics of random sets, i.e., distributions over the power set of the sample space. Based on the epistemic deep learning approach, random-set models are capable of representing the 'epistemic' uncertainty induced in machine learning by limited training sets. We estimate epistemic uncertainty by approximating the size of credal sets associated with the predicted belief functions, and experimentally demonstrate how our approach outperforms competing uncertainty-aware approaches in a classical evaluation setting. The performance of RS-CNN is best demonstrated on OOD samples where it manages to capture the true prediction while standard CNNs fail. ",

Objective: To create an automated algorithm for UWF-FP artifact classification. Design: A neural network based automated artifact detection algorithm was designed to identify commonly encountered UWF-FP artifacts in a cross section of patient UWF-FP. A pre-trained ResNet-50 neural network was trained on a subset of the images and the classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were quantified on the hold out test set. Setting: The study is based on patients from a tertiary care hospital site. Participants: There were 243 UWF-FP acquired from patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), and artifact labelling in the following categories was performed: Eyelash Present, Lower Eyelid Obstructing, Upper Eyelid Obstructing, Image Too Dark, Dark Artifact, and Image Not Centered. Results: Overall, the accuracy for each class was Eyelash Present at 83.7%, Lower Eyelid Obstructing at 83.7%, Upper Eyelid Obstructing at 98.0%, Image Too Dark at 77.6%, Dark Artifact at 93.9%, and Image Not Centered at 91.8%. Conclusions and Relevance: This automated algorithm shows promise in identifying common imaging artifacts on a subset of Optos UWF-FP in SCD patients. Further refinement is ongoing with the goal of improving efficiency of tele-retinal screening in sickle cell retinopathy (SCR) by providing a photographer real-time feedback as to the types of artifacts present, and the need for image re-acquisition. This algorithm also may have potential future applicability in other retinal diseases by improving quality and efficiency of image acquisition of UWF-FP. ",

    "abstract": "As AI systems become increasingly prevalent in various aspects of daily life, gaining a comprehensive understanding of public perception towards these AI systems has become increasingly essential for several reasons such as ethical considerations, user experience, fear, disinformation, regulation, collaboration, and co-creation. In this study, we investigate how mass social media users perceive the recent rise of AI frameworks such as ChatGPT. We collect a total of 33,912 comments in 388 unique subreddits spanning from November 30, 2022 to June 8, 2023 using a list of AI-related keywords. We employ BERTopic to uncover the major themes regarding AI on Reddit. Additionally, we seek to gain deeper insights into public opinion by examining the distribution of topics across different subreddits. We observe that technology-related subreddits predominantly focus on the technical aspects of AI models. On the other hand, non-tech subreddits show greater interest in social issues such as concerns about job replacement or furlough. We leverage zero-shot prompting to analyze the sentiment and perception of AI among individual users. Through a comprehensive sentiment and emotion analysis, we discover that tech-centric communities exhibit greater polarization compared to non-tech communities when discussing AI topics. This research contributes to our broader understanding of public opinion surrounding artificial intelligence. ",

The problem entails a weighted graph $G = (V, E)$ with non-negative weights, and a subset of edges $E^{\\prime} \\subset E$ which needs to be removed from G (with their endpoints merged as a supernode). The goal is to redistribute the weights of the deleted edges in a way that minimizes the error. The error is defined as the sum of the absolute differences of the shortest path lengths between different pairs of nodes before and after contracting $E^{\\prime}$. Based on this error function, we propose optimal approaches for merging any subset of edges in a path and a single edge in a tree. Previous works on graph compression techniques aimed at preserving different graph properties (such as the chromatic number) or solely focused on identifying the optimal set of edges to contract. However, our focus in this paper is on achieving optimal edge contraction (when the contracted edges are provided as input) specifically for weighted trees and paths. ",

    "abstract": "Simplicial complexes have recently been in the limelight of higher-order network analysis, where a minority of simplices play crucial roles in structures and functions due to network heterogeneity. We find a significant inconsistency between identifying influential nodes and simplices. Therefore, it remains elusive how to characterize simplices' influence and identify influential simplices, despite the relative maturity of research on influential nodes (0-simplices) identification. Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) are potent tools that can exploit network topology and node features simultaneously, but they struggle to tackle higher-order tasks. In this paper, we propose a higher-order graph learning model, named influential simplices mining neural network (ISMnet), to identify vital h-simplices in simplicial complexes. It can tackle higher-order tasks by leveraging novel higher-order presentations: hierarchical bipartite graphs and higher-order hierarchical (HoH) Laplacians, where targeted simplices are grouped into a hub set and can interact with other simplices. Furthermore, ISMnet employs learnable graph convolutional operators in each HoH Laplacian domain to capture interactions among simplices, and it can identify influential simplices of arbitrary order by changing the hub set. Empirical results demonstrate that ISMnet significantly outperforms existing methods in ranking 0-simplices (nodes) and 2-simplices. In general, this novel framework excels in identifying influential simplices and promises to serve as a potent tool in higher-order network analysis. ",

    "abstract": "3D human pose estimation has been researched for decades with promising fruits. 3D human pose lifting is one of the promising research directions toward the task where both estimated pose and ground truth pose data are used for training. Existing pose lifting works mainly focus on improving the performance of estimated pose, but they usually underperform when testing on the ground truth pose data. We observe that the performance of the estimated pose can be easily improved by preparing good quality 2D pose, such as fine-tuning the 2D pose or using advanced 2D pose detectors. As such, we concentrate on improving the 3D human pose lifting via ground truth data for the future improvement of more quality estimated pose data. Towards this goal, a simple yet effective model called Global-local Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (GLA-GCN) is proposed in this work. Our GLA-GCN globally models the spatiotemporal structure via a graph representation and backtraces local joint features for 3D human pose estimation via individually connected layers. To validate our model design, we conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets: Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP. Experimental results show that our GLA-GCN implemented with ground truth 2D poses significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., up to around 3%, 17%, and 13% error reductions on Human3.6M, HumanEva-I, and MPI-INF-3DHP, respectively).

    "abstract": "Memory is an important cognitive function for humans. How a brain with such a small power can complete such a complex memory function, the working mechanism behind this is undoubtedly fascinating. Engram theory views memory as the co-activation of specific neuronal clusters. From the perspective of graph theory, nodes represent neurons, and directed edges represent synapses. Then the memory engram is the connected subgraph formed between the activated nodes. In this paper, we use subgraphs as physical carriers of information and propose a parallel distributed information storage algorithm based on node scale in active-directed graphs. An active-directed graph is defined as a graph in which each node has autonomous and independent behavior and relies only on information obtained within the local field of view to make decisions. Unlike static directed graphs used for recording facts, active-directed graphs are decentralized like biological neuron networks and do not have a super manager who has a global view and can control the behavior of each node. Distinct from traditional algorithms with a global field of view, this algorithm is characterized by nodes collaborating globally on resource usage through their limited local field of view. While this strategy may not achieve global optimality as well as algorithms with a global field of view, it offers better robustness, concurrency, decentralization, and bioviability. Finally, it was tested in network capacity, fault tolerance, and robustness. It was found that the algorithm exhibits a larger network capacity in a more sparse network structure because the subgraph generated by a single sample is not a whole but consists of multiple weakly connected components. In this case, the network capacity can be understood as the number of permutations of several weakly connected components in the network. ",

However, their performance at short block lengths under standard successive cancellation decoding is far from desirable. An effective method to improve the performance at short lengths is CRC precoding followed by successive-cancellation list decoding. Later, Arikan presented polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes, which further improve the performance of polar codes. In fact, bit-flipping is another post-processing method that can improve decoding performance. In this paper, we propose a novel SCL Bit-Flipping of PAC Codes. We show that better performance can be achieved using list decoding when the list size is the same for PAC codes (N=128, K=64). The decoding performance of our newly proposed PAC-SCLF with a list size of 32 is 0.3 dB better than that of the traditional PAC-SCL with a list size of 32. We set the maximum number of bit flips to 5. The performance of the list size (L=32) for PAC-SCLF is almost the same as the performance of the list size (L=128) for PAC-SCL. ",

Specifically, the aggregation and update functions in the GNN architecture are designed by utilizing the summation and power calculation components of the WMMSE algorithm, which leads to improved model generalization and interpretabiliy. Theoretical analysis of the proposed approach reveals its capability to simplify intricate end-to-end mappings and diminish the model exploration space, resulting in increased network expressiveness and enhanced optimization performance. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and strong performance of the proposed knowledge-driven resource allocation approach across diverse communication topologies without retraining. Our findings contribute to the development of efficient and scalable wireless resource management solutions for distributed and dynamic networks with strict latency requirements. ",

    "abstract": "Mitosis detection is one of the fundamental tasks in computational pathology, which is extremely challenging due to the heterogeneity of mitotic cell. Most of the current studies solve the heterogeneity in the technical aspect by increasing the model complexity. However, lacking consideration of the biological knowledge and the complex model design may lead to the overfitting problem while limited the generalizability of the detection model. In this paper, we systematically study the morphological appearances in different mitotic phases as well as the ambiguous non-mitotic cells and identify that balancing the data and feature diversity can achieve better generalizability. Based on this observation, we propose a novel generalizable framework (MitDet) for mitosis detection. The data diversity is considered by the proposed diversity-guided sample balancing (DGSB). And the feature diversity is preserved by inter- and intra- class feature diversity-preserved module (InCDP). Stain enhancement (SE) module is introduced to enhance the domain-relevant diversity of both data and features simultaneously. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed model outperforms all the SOTA approaches in several popular mitosis detection datasets in both internal and external test sets using minimal annotation efforts with point annotations only. Comprehensive ablation studies have also proven the effectiveness of the rethinking of data and feature diversity balancing. By analyzing the results quantitatively and qualitatively, we believe that our proposed model not only achieves SOTA performance but also might inspire the future studies in new perspectives.

To overcome such drawbacks, this paper pays special attention on the consistent surface reconstruction from sparse views with noisy camera poses. Unlike previous approaches, the key difference of this paper is to exploit the multi-view constraints directly from the explicit geometry of the neural surface, which can be used as effective regularization to jointly learn the neural surface and refine the camera poses. To build effective multi-view constraints, we introduce a fast differentiable on-surface intersection to generate on-surface points, and propose view-consistent losses based on such differentiable points to regularize the neural surface learning. Based on this point, we propose a jointly learning strategy for neural surface and camera poses, named SC-NeuS, to perform geometry-consistent surface reconstruction in an end-to-end manner. With extensive evaluation on public datasets, our SC-NeuS can achieve consistently better surface reconstruction results with fine-grained details than previous state-of-the-art neural surface reconstruction approaches, especially from sparse and noisy camera views.

    "abstract": "Noisy label problems are inevitably in existence within medical image segmentation causing severe performance degradation. Previous segmentation methods for noisy label problems only utilize a single image while the potential of leveraging the correlation between images has been overlooked. Especially for video segmentation, adjacent frames contain rich contextual information beneficial in cognizing noisy labels. Based on two insights, we propose a Multi-Scale Temporal Feature Affinity Learning (MS-TFAL) framework to resolve noisy-labeled medical video segmentation issues. First, we argue the sequential prior of videos is an effective reference, i.e., pixel-level features from adjacent frames are close in distance for the same class and far in distance otherwise. Therefore, Temporal Feature Affinity Learning (TFAL) is devised to indicate possible noisy labels by evaluating the affinity between pixels in two adjacent frames. We also notice that the noise distribution exhibits considerable variations across video, image, and pixel levels. In this way, we introduce Multi-Scale Supervision (MSS) to supervise the network from three different perspectives by re-weighting and refining the samples. This design enables the network to concentrate on clean samples in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experiments with both synthetic and real-world label noise demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art robust segmentation approaches.

However, compared to other generative methods like VAEs and GANs, DPMs lack a low-dimensional, interpretable, and well-decoupled latent code. Recently, diffusion autoencoders (Diff-AE) were proposed to explore the potential of DPMs for representation learning via autoencoding. Diff-AE provides an accessible latent space that exhibits remarkable interpretability, allowing us to manipulate image attributes based on latent codes from the space. However, previous works are not generic as they only operated on a few limited attributes. To further explore the latent space of Diff-AE and achieve a generic editing pipeline, we proposed a module called Group-supervised AutoEncoder(dubbed GAE) for Diff-AE to achieve better disentanglement on the latent code. Our proposed GAE has trained via an attribute-swap strategy to acquire the latent codes for multi-attribute image manipulation based on examples. We empirically demonstrate that our method enables multiple-attributes manipulation and achieves convincing sample quality and attribute alignments, while significantly reducing computational requirements compared to pixel-based approaches for representational decoupling.

The shortest path is a fundamental concept in graph analysis and recent research shows that counting the number of shortest paths between two vertices is crucial in applications like potential friend recommendation and betweenness analysis. However, current studies that use hub labeling techniques for real-time shortest path counting are limited by their reliance on a pre-computed index, which cannot tackle frequent updates over dynamic graphs. To address this, we propose a novel approach for maintaining the index in response to changes in the graph structure and develop incremental (IncSPC) and decremental (DecSPC) update algorithms for inserting and deleting vertices/edges, respectively. The main idea of these two algorithms is that we only locate the affected vertices to update the index. Our experiments demonstrate that our dynamic algorithms are up to four orders of magnitude faster processing for incremental updates and up to three orders of magnitude faster processing for hybrid updates than reconstruction.

Here we report a stock pairs-trading system that finds trading opportunities for any two stocks in an $N$-stock universe using a combinatorial optimization accelerator based on a quantum-inspired algorithm called simulated bifurcation. The trading opportunities are detected through solving an optimal path search problem in an $N$-node directed graph with edge weights corresponding to the products of instantaneous price differences and statistical correlation factors between two stocks. The accelerator is one of Ising machines and operates consecutively to find multiple opportunities in a market situation with avoiding duplicate detections by a tabu search technique. It has been demonstrated in the Tokyo Stock Exchange that the FPGA (field-programmable gate array)-based trading system has a sufficiently low latency (33 $\\mu$s for $N$=15 or 210 pairs) to execute the pairs-trading strategy based on optimal path search in market graphs.

In this paper we present a new formulation of the IFTR model as a countable mixture of Gamma distributions which greatly facilitates the performance evaluation for this model in terms of the metrics already known for the much simpler and widely used Nakagami-m fading. Additionally, a closed-form expression is presented for the generalized moment generating function (GMGF), which permits to readily obtain all the moments of the distribution of the model, as well as several relevant performance metrics. Based on these new derivations, the IFTR model is evaluated for the average channel capacity, the outage probability with and without co-channel interference, and the bit error rate (BER), which are verified by Monte Carlo simulations.

Aphid detection is very challenging as each individual aphid is really small and all aphids are crowded together as clusters. In this paper, we propose to estimate the infection level by detecting aphid clusters. We have taken millions of images in the sorghum fields, manually selected 5,447 images that contain aphids, and annotated each aphid cluster in the image. To use these images for machine learning models, we crop the images into patches and created a labeled dataset with over 151,000 image patches. Then, we implement and compare the performance of four state-of-the-art object detection models. ",

    "title": "Introducing Packet-Level Analysis in Programmable Data Planes to Advance  Network Intrusion Detection",
    "abstract": "Programmable data planes offer precise control over the low-level processing steps applied to network packets, serving as a valuable tool for analysing malicious flows in the field of intrusion detection. Albeit with limitations on physical resources and capabilities, they allow for the efficient extraction of detailed traffic information, which can then be utilised by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms responsible for identifying security threats. In addressing resource constraints, existing solutions in the literature rely on compressing network data through the collection of statistical traffic features in the data plane. While this compression saves memory resources in switches and minimises the burden on the control channel between the data and the control plane, it also results in a loss of information available to the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), limiting access to packet payload, categorical features, and the semantic understanding of network communications, such as the behaviour of packets within traffic flows. This paper proposes P4DDLe, a framework that exploits the flexibility of P4-based programmable data planes for packet-level feature extraction and pre-processing. P4DDLe leverages the programmable data plane to extract raw packet features from the network traffic, categorical features included, and to organise them in a way that the semantics of traffic flows is preserved. To minimise memory and control channel overheads, P4DDLe selectively processes and filters packet-level data, so that all and only the relevant features required by the NIDS are collected. The experimental evaluation with recent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack data demonstrates that the proposed approach is very efficient in collecting compact and high-quality representations of network flows, ensuring precise detection of DDoS attacks.

We focus on the problem of automatically reconciling the trade-off between prediction accuracy and prediction earliness in determining when to adapt. Adaptations should happen sufficiently early to provide enough lead time for the adaptation to become effective. However, earlier predictions are typically less accurate than later predictions. This means that acting on less accurate predictions may lead to unnecessary adaptations or missed adaptations. Different approaches were presented in the literature to reconcile the trade-off between prediction accuracy and earliness. So far, these approaches were compared with different baselines, and evaluated using different data sets or even confidential data sets. This limits the comparability and replicability of the approaches and makes it difficult to choose a concrete approach in practice. We perform a comparative evaluation of the main alternative approaches for reconciling the trade-off between prediction accuracy and earliness. Using four public real-world event log data sets and two types of prediction models, we assess and compare the cost savings of these approaches. The experimental results indicate which criteria affect the effectiveness of an approach and help us state initial recommendations for the selection of a concrete approach in practice. ",

The YOGA architecture consists of a two-phase feature learning pipeline with a cheap linear transformation, which learns feature maps using only half of the convolution filters required by conventional convolutional neural networks. In addition, it performs multi-scale feature fusion in its neck using an attention mechanism instead of the naive concatenation used by conventional detectors.

We evaluate YOGA on COCO-val and COCO-testdev datasets with other over 10 state-of-the-art object detectors. The results show that YOGA strikes the best trade-off between model size and accuracy (up to 22% increase of AP and 23-34% reduction of parameters and FLOPs), making it an ideal choice for deployment in the wild on low-end edge devices.

    "abstract": "Deep-learning models for traffic data prediction can have superior performance in modeling complex functions using a multi-layer architecture. However, a major drawback of these approaches is that most of these approaches do not offer forecasts with uncertainty estimates, which are essential for traffic operations and control. Without uncertainty estimates, it is difficult to place any level of trust to the model predictions, and operational strategies relying on overconfident predictions can lead to worsening traffic conditions. In this study, we propose a Bayesian recurrent neural network framework for uncertainty quantification in traffic prediction with higher generalizability by introducing spectral normalization to its hidden layers. In our paper, we have shown that normalization alters the training process of deep neural networks by controlling the model's complexity and reducing the risk of overfitting to the training data. This, in turn, helps improve the generalization performance of the model on out-of-distribution datasets. Results demonstrate that spectral normalization improves uncertainty estimates and significantly outperforms both the layer normalization and model without normalization in single-step prediction horizons. This improved performance can be attributed to the ability of spectral normalization to better localize the feature space of the data under perturbations. Our findings are especially relevant to traffic management applications, where predicting traffic conditions across multiple locations is the goal, but the availability of training data from multiple locations is limited. Spectral normalization, therefore, provides a more generalizable approach that can effectively capture the underlying patterns in traffic data without requiring location-specific models. ",

However, the generated data of the existing methods are extremely similar or even the same. The strong dependency among the generated data will lead the learning to fail. In this paper, we propose a diversity-enhancing generative network (DEG-Net) for the FHA problem, which can generate diverse unlabeled data with the help of a kernel independence measure: the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Specifically, DEG-Net will generate data via minimizing the HSIC value (i.e., maximizing the independence) among the semantic features of the generated data. By DEG-Net, the generated unlabeled data are more diverse and more effective for addressing the FHA problem. Experimental results show that the DEG-Net outperforms existing FHA baselines and further verifies that generating diverse data plays a vital role in addressing the FHA problem ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) models for spatio-temporal traffic flow forecasting employ convolutional or graph-convolutional filters along with recurrent neural networks to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in traffic data. These models, such as CNN-LSTM, utilize traffic flows from neighboring detector stations to predict flows at a specific location of interest. However, these models are limited in their ability to capture the broader dynamics of the traffic system, as they primarily learn features specific to the detector configuration and traffic characteristics at the target location. Hence, the transferability of these models to different locations becomes challenging, particularly when data is unavailable at the new location for model training. To address this limitation, we propose a traffic flow physics-based feature transformation for spatio-temporal DL models. This transformation incorporates Newell's uncongested and congested-state estimators of traffic flows at the target locations, enabling the models to learn broader dynamics of the system. Our methodology is empirically validated using traffic data from two different locations. The results demonstrate that the proposed feature transformation improves the models' performance in predicting traffic flows over different prediction horizons, as indicated by better goodness-of-fit statistics. An important advantage of our framework is its ability to be transferred to new locations where data is unavailable. This is achieved by appropriately accounting for spatial dependencies based on station distances and various traffic parameters. In contrast, regular DL models are not easily transferable as their inputs remain fixed. It should be noted that due to data limitations, we were unable to perform spatial sensitivity analysis, which calls for further research using simulated data. ",

Recently, supervised deep neural network-based models have shown promising performance in CVR prediction. However, they are data hungry and require an enormous amount of training data. In online advertising systems, although there are millions to billions of ads, users tend to click only a small set of them and to convert on an even smaller set. This data sparsity issue restricts the power of these deep models. In this paper, we propose the Contrastive Learning for CVR prediction (CL4CVR) framework. It associates the supervised CVR prediction task with a contrastive learning task, which can learn better data representations exploiting abundant unlabeled data and improve the CVR prediction performance. To tailor the contrastive learning task to the CVR prediction problem, we propose embedding masking (EM), rather than feature masking, to create two views of augmented samples. We also propose a false negative elimination (FNE) component to eliminate samples with the same feature as the anchor sample, to account for the natural property in user behavior data. We further propose a supervised positive inclusion (SPI) component to include additional positive samples for each anchor sample, in order to make full use of sparse but precious user conversion events. Experimental results on two real-world conversion datasets demonstrate the superior performance of CL4CVR. The source code is available at https://github.com/DongRuiHust/CL4CVR. ",

The results show that robotic persuaders that exert social power (specifically from expert, reward, and coercion bases) demonstrate increased ability to influence humans. The first study provides a positive answer and shows that under the same circumstances, people with different personalities prefer robots using a specific social power base. In addition, social rewards can be useful in persuading individuals. The second study suggests that by employing social power, social robots are capable of persuading people objectively to select a less desirable choice among others. Finally, the third study shows that the effect of power on persuasion does not decay over time and might strengthen under specific circumstances. Moreover, exerting stronger social power does not necessarily lead to higher persuasion.

To overcome huge signaling overhead in the fully-centralized detection, we propose a two-layer distributed uplink detection scheme, where the uplink signals are first detected in the AP-UAVs by using the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) detector depending on local channel state information (CSI), and then collected and weighted combined at the CPU-UAV to obtain the refined detection. By using the operator-valued free probability theory, the asymptotic expressions of the combining weights are obtained, which only depend on the statistical CSI and show excellent accuracy. Based on the proposed distributed scheme, we further investigate the impacts of different distributed deployments on the achieved spectral efficiency (SE). Numerical results show that in urban and dense urban environments, it is more beneficial to deploy more AP-UAVs to achieve higher SE. On the other hand, in suburban environment, an optimal ratio between the number of deployed UAVs and the number of antennas per UAV exists to maximize the SE. ",

The backlash, which is nonsmooth and nonlinear, is inevitable in the operation of many systems, but it can have destructive effects on the stability and performance of feedback systems. In this work, a robust controller is designed using a modified linear internal model control framework. Different controller architectures are considered and compared based on an experimental case study. The experimental testbased is composed of a three-platform structure driven by a stepper motor. The backlash is introduced into the system in a non-destructive and controllable manner by closing an internal nonlinear feedback loop around the stepper motor. The robustness of the designed controller to a large amount of backlash is verified experimentally, and while the stability is maintained, some residual vibrations are observed. The effects on the residual vibration levels of including nonlinear elements in the controller and changing the controller's settling time are also examined experimentally. The robustness to changes and mismodelling of the linear system, with and without the backlash, is described, as is the tracking of a smooth sinusoidal command signal with a growing amount of backlash. Based on the case study, it is concluded that combining the linear internal model control design method with a small dead zone results in a highly robust controller both with respect to the backlash and to changes in the linear system, which ensure stability and good performance. The required robustness is achieved by tuning the controller's settling time and the dead zone width parameters. ",

    "abstract": "Accurately recovering the dense 3D mesh of both hands from monocular images poses considerable challenges due to occlusions and projection ambiguity. Most of the existing methods extract features from color images to estimate the root-aligned hand meshes, which neglect the crucial depth and scale information in the real world. Given the noisy sensor measurements with limited resolution, depth-based methods predict 3D keypoints rather than a dense mesh. These limitations motivate us to take advantage of these two complementary inputs to acquire dense hand meshes on a real-world scale. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework for recovering dense meshes for both hands, which employ single-view RGB-D image pairs as input. The primary challenge lies in effectively utilizing two different input modalities to mitigate the blurring effects in RGB images and noises in depth images. Instead of directly treating depth maps as additional channels for RGB images, we encode the depth information into the unordered point cloud to preserve more geometric details. Specifically, our framework employs ResNet50 and PointNet++ to derive features from RGB and point cloud, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a novel pyramid deep fusion network (PDFNet) to aggregate features at different scales, which demonstrates superior efficacy compared to previous fusion strategies. Furthermore, we employ a GCN-based decoder to process the fused features and recover the corresponding 3D pose and dense mesh. Through comprehensive ablation experiments, we have not only demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed fusion algorithm but also outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches on publicly available datasets.

By its very nature, the mapping between the measurement and sparse signal is a non-linear operation. Traditional support estimators rely on computationally expensive iterative signal recovery techniques to achieve such non-linearity. Contrary to the convolution layers, the proposed OSEN approach consists of operational layers that can learn such complex non-linearities without the need for deep networks. In this way, the performance of the non-iterative support estimation is greatly improved. Moreover, the operational layers comprise so-called generative \\textit{super neurons} with non-local kernels. The kernel location for each neuron/feature map is optimized jointly for the SE task during the training. We evaluate the OSENs in three different applications: i. support estimation from Compressive Sensing (CS) measurements, ii. representation-based classification, and iii. learning-aided CS reconstruction where the output of OSENs is used as prior knowledge to the CS algorithm for an enhanced reconstruction. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves computational efficiency and outperforms competing methods, especially at low measurement rates by a significant margin.

Specifically, there are optimization methods for matrix multiplication, such as the Strassen algorithm and the Ozaki scheme, which can be used to speed up computation. For complex matrix multiplication, the 3M method can also be used, which requires only three multiplications of real matrices, instead of the 4M method, which requires four multiplications of real matrices. In this study, we extend these optimization methods to arbitrary precision complex matrix multiplication and verify the possible increase in computation speed through benchmark tests. The optimization methods are also applied to complex LU decomposition using matrix multiplication to demonstrate that the Ozaki scheme can be used to achieve higher computation speeds. ",

The model generalises committee elections (where there is a single constraint on the number of candidates that need to be selected), various elections with diversity constraints, the model of public decisions (where decisions needs to be taken on a number of independent issues), and the model of collective scheduling. A critical property of voting is that it should be fair -- not only to individuals but also to groups of voters with similar opinions on the subject of the vote; in other words, the outcome of an election should proportionally reflect the voters' preferences. We formulate axioms of proportionality in this general model. Our axioms do not require predefining groups of voters; to the contrary, we ensure that the opinion of every subset of voters whose preferences are cohesive-enough are taken into account to the extent that is proportional to the size of the subset. Our axioms are always satisfiable, and generalize the strongest known satisfiable axioms for the more specific models. We explain how to adapt two prominent committee election rules, Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) and Phragmen Sequential Rule, as well as the concept of stable-priceability to our general model. The two rules satisfy our proportionality axioms if and only if the feasibility constraints are matroids. ",

To address this issue and improve their robustness to inhomogeneities and noise in both their internal state variables and external input signals, we designed on-chip learning circuits with short-term analog dynamics and long-term tristate discretization mechanisms. An additional hysteretic stop-learning mechanism is included to improve stability and automatically disable weight updates when necessary, to enable continuous always-on learning. We designed a spiking neural network with these learning circuits in a prototype chip using a 180 nm CMOS technology. Simulation and silicon measurement results from the prototype chip are presented.

Our framework only utilizes the onboard inertial measurement unit (IMU) to detect and estimate collisions. We further design a collision recovery control for rapid recovery and collision-aware mapping to integrate collision information into general LiDAR-based sensing and planning frameworks.

Breadth first search solves this problem in linear time, which is clearly also a lower bound in the worst case.

In this work, we extend these results by giving sublinear time shortest path (and short path) algorithms for expander graphs. We thus identify a natural deterministic property of a graph (that is satisfied by typical random regular graphs) which suffices for sublinear time shortest paths. The algorithms are very simple, involving only bidirectional breadth first search and short random walks. We also complement our new algorithms by near-matching lower bounds. ",

However, it has been increasingly recognized that the \"comparing different MI attacks\" methodology used in the existing works has serious limitations. Due to these limitations, we found (through the experiments in this work) that some comparison results reported in the literature are quite misleading. In this paper, we seek to develop a comprehensive benchmark for comparing different MI attacks, called MIBench, which consists not only the evaluation metrics, but also the evaluation scenarios. And we design the evaluation scenarios from four perspectives: the distance distribution of data samples in the target dataset, the distance between data samples of the target dataset, the differential distance between two datasets (i.e., the target dataset and a generated dataset with only nonmembers), and the ratio of the samples that are made no inferences by an MI attack. The evaluation metrics consist of ten typical evaluation metrics. We have identified three principles for the proposed \"comparing different MI attacks\" methodology, and we have designed and implemented the MIBench benchmark with 84 evaluation scenarios for each dataset. In total, we have used our benchmark to fairly and systematically compare 15 state-of-the-art MI attack algorithms across 588 evaluation scenarios, and these evaluation scenarios cover 7 widely used datasets and 7 representative types of models.

To ensure the scalability of our approach, we: (1) exploit the hierarchical nature of 3DSGs to allow LLMs to conduct a semantic search for task-relevant subgraphs from a smaller, collapsed representation of the full graph; (2) reduce the planning horizon for the LLM by integrating a classical path planner and (3) introduce an iterative replanning pipeline that refines the initial plan using feedback from a scene graph simulator, correcting infeasible actions and avoiding planning failures. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale environments spanning up to 3 floors, 36 rooms and 140 objects, and show that our approach is capable of grounding large-scale, long-horizon task plans from abstract, and natural language instruction for a mobile manipulator robot to execute.

The network backbone takes randomly initialized noise as input and is supervised on the SAIs of the target light field. It is composed of two types of complementary kernels: descriptive kernels (descriptors) that store scene description information learned during training, and modulatory kernels (modulators) that control the rendering of different SAIs from the queried perspectives. To further enhance compactness of the network meanwhile retain high quality of the decoded light field, we accordingly introduce modulator allocation and kernel tensor decomposition mechanisms, followed by non-uniform quantization and lossless entropy coding techniques, to finally form an efficient compression pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a significant margin in the light field compression task. Moreover, after aligning descriptors, the modulators learned from one light field can be transferred to new light fields for rendering dense views, indicating a potential solution for view synthesis task.

Towards personalized generative services, a collaborative cloud-edge methodology sounds promising, as it facilitates the effective orchestration of heterogeneous distributed communication and computing resources. In this article, after discussing the pros and cons of several candidate cloud-edge collaboration techniques, we put forward NetGPT to capably deploy appropriate LLMs at the edge and the cloud in accordance with their computing capacity. In addition, edge LLMs could efficiently leverage location-based information for personalized prompt completion, thus benefiting the interaction with cloud LLMs. After deploying representative open-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-2-base and LLaMA model) at the edge and the cloud, we present the feasibility of NetGPT on the basis of low-rank adaptation-based light-weight fine-tuning. Subsequently, we highlight substantial essential changes required for a native artificial intelligence (AI) network architecture towards NetGPT, with special emphasis on deeper integration of communications and computing resources and careful calibration of logical AI workflow. Furthermore, we demonstrate several by-product benefits of NetGPT, given edge LLM's astonishing capability to predict trends and infer intents, which possibly leads to a unified solution for intelligent network management \\& orchestration.

To alleviate these issues, we proposed auxiliary-task learning-based physics-informed neural networks (ATL-PINNs), which provide four different auxiliary-task learning modes and investigate their performance compared with original PINNs. We also employ the gradient cosine similarity algorithm to integrate auxiliary problem loss with the primary problem loss in ATL-PINNs, which aims to enhance the effectiveness of the auxiliary-task learning modes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce auxiliary-task learning modes in the context of physics-informed learning.

This process is clearly sensitive to the amount of available samples and might be computationally expensive for on-board systems. A viable alternative is that of evaluating similarities in the embedding space produced by large pre-trained models without any further learning effort.

This works presents an in-depth analysis of the recently introduced relational reasoning pre-training and investigates the properties of the learned embedding, highlighting the existence of a correlation between the inter-class feature distance and the OOD detection accuracy.

    "abstract": "To accommodate various use cases with differing characteristics, the Fifth Generation (5G) mobile communications system intends to utilize network slicing. Network slicing enables the creation of multiple logical networks over a shared physical network infrastructure. While the problems such as resource allocation for multiple slices in mobile networks have been explored in considerable detail in the existing literature, the suitability of the existing mobile network architecture to support network slicing has not been analysed adequately. We think the existing 5G System (5GS) architecture suffers from certain limitations, such as a lack of slice isolation in its control plane. This work focuses on the future evolution of the existing 5GS architecture from a slicing perspective, especially that of its control plane, addressing some of the limitations of the existing 5GS architecture. We propose a new network architecture which enables efficient slicing in beyond 5G networks. The proposed architecture results in enhanced modularity and scalability of the control plane in sliced mobile networks. In addition, it also brings slice isolation to the control plane, which is not feasible in the existing 5G system. We also present a performance evaluation that confirms the improved performance and scalability of the proposed system viz a viz the existing 5G system. ",

    "abstract": "Image synthesis has seen significant advancements with the advent of diffusion-based generative models like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and text-to-image diffusion models. Despite their efficacy, there is a dearth of research dedicated to detecting diffusion-generated images, which could pose potential security and privacy risks. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel detection method called Stepwise Error for Diffusion-generated Image Detection (SeDID). Comprising statistical-based $\\text{SeDID}_{\\text{Stat}}$ and neural network-based $\\text{SeDID}_{\\text{NNs}}$, SeDID exploits the unique attributes of diffusion models, namely deterministic reverse and deterministic denoising computation errors. Our evaluations demonstrate SeDID's superior performance over existing methods when applied to diffusion models. Thus, our work makes a pivotal contribution to distinguishing diffusion model-generated images, marking a significant step in the domain of artificial intelligence security. ",

    "abstract": "Power losses in electrical power systems especially, distribution systems, occur due to several environmental and technical factors. Transmission & Distribution line losses are normally 17% and 50% respectively. These losses are due to the inappropriate size of the conductor, long distribution lines, low power factor, overloading of lines etc. The power losses cause economic loss and reduce the system's reliability. The reliability of electrical power systems can be improved by decreasing network power loss and by improving the voltage profile. In radial distribution systems, power loss can also be minimized through Distributed Generation (DG) system placement. In this thesis, three different grid strategies including real power sharing, reactive power injection and transformer tap changing are discussed and used to minimize line losses. These three proposed grid strategies have been implemented using a power flow study based on Newton-Raphson (NR) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). To minimize line losses, both methods have been used for each grid strategy. The used test system in this research work is the IEEE-30 bus radial distribution system. Results obtained after simulation of each grid strategy using NR and GA shows that real load sharing is reliable with respect to minimization of line loss as compared to reactive power injection and transformer tap changing grid strategy. Comparative analysis has been performed between GA and NR for each grid strategy, results show that Genetic Algorithm is more reliable and efficient for loss minimization as compared to Newton-Raphson. In the base case for optimum power flow solution using genetic algorithm and Newton-Raphson, real line losses are 9.481475MW and 17.557MW respectively. So, GA is preferable for each proposed grid strategy to minimize line losses than NR. ",

    "abstract": "Neural networks have shown great success in many machine learning related tasks, due to their ability to act as general function approximators. Recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of neural networks in control systems (known as neural feedback loops), most notably by using a neural network as a controller. However, one of the big challenges of this approach is that neural networks have been shown to be sensitive to adversarial attacks. This means that, unless they are designed properly, they are not an ideal candidate for controllers due to issues with robustness and uncertainty, which are pivotal aspects of control systems. There has been initial work on robustness to both analyse and design dynamical systems with neural network controllers. However, one prominent issue with these methods is that they use existing neural network architectures tailored for traditional machine learning tasks. These structures may not be appropriate for neural network controllers and it is important to consider alternative architectures. This paper considers rational neural networks and presents novel rational activation functions, which can be used effectively in robustness problems for neural feedback loops. Rational activation functions are replaced by a general rational neural network structure, which is convex in the neural network's parameters. A method is proposed to recover a stabilising controller from a Sum of Squares feasibility test. This approach is then applied to a refined rational neural network which is more compatible with Sum of Squares programming. Numerical examples show that this method can successfully recover stabilising rational neural network controllers for neural feedback loops with non-linear plants with noise and parametric uncertainty.

These safety properties of DNNs can be proven using tools developed by the verification community. However, these tools are themselves prone to implementation bugs and numerical stability problems, which make their reliability questionable. To overcome this, some verifiers produce proofs of their results which can be checked by a trusted checker. In this work, we present a novel implementation of a proof checker for DNN verification. It improves on existing implementations by offering numerical stability and greater verifiability. To achieve this, we leverage two key capabilities of Imandra, an industrial theorem prover: its support of infinite precision real arithmetic and its formal verification infrastructure. So far, we have implemented a proof checker in Imandra, specified its correctness properties and started to verify the checker's compliance with them. Our ongoing work focuses on completing the formal verification of the checker and further optimizing its performance. ",

    "abstract": "Precomputed Radiance Transfer (PRT) remains an attractive solution for real-time rendering of complex light transport effects such as glossy global illumination. After precomputation, we can relight the scene with new environment maps while changing viewpoint in real-time. However, practical PRT methods are usually limited to low-frequency spherical harmonic lighting. All-frequency techniques using wavelets are promising but have so far had little practical impact. The curse of dimensionality and much higher data requirements have typically limited them to relighting with fixed view or only direct lighting with triple product integrals. In this paper, we demonstrate a hybrid neural-wavelet PRT solution to high-frequency indirect illumination, including glossy reflection, for relighting with changing view. Specifically, we seek to represent the light transport function in the Haar wavelet basis. For global illumination, we learn the wavelet transport using a small multi-layer perceptron (MLP) applied to a feature field as a function of spatial location and wavelet index, with reflected direction and material parameters being other MLP inputs. We optimize/learn the feature field (compactly represented by a tensor decomposition) and MLP parameters from multiple images of the scene under different lighting and viewing conditions. We demonstrate real-time (512 x 512 at 24 FPS, 800 x 600 at 13 FPS) precomputed rendering of challenging scenes involving view-dependent reflections and even caustics. ",

We evaluated whether physical color calibration of scanners can standardize WSI appearance and enable robust AI performance.

This work focuses on developing an inverse UQ process for time-dependent responses, using dimensionality reduction by functional principal component analysis (PCA) and deep neural network (DNN)-based surrogate models. The demonstration is based on the inverse UQ of TRACE physical model parameters using the FEBA transient experimental data. The measurement data is time-dependent peak cladding temperature (PCT). Since the quantity-of-interest (QoI) is time-dependent that corresponds to infinite-dimensional responses, PCA is used to reduce the QoI dimension while preserving the transient profile of the PCT, in order to make the inverse UQ process more efficient. However, conventional PCA applied directly to the PCT time series profiles can hardly represent the data precisely due to the sudden temperature drop at the time of quenching. As a result, a functional alignment method is used to separate the phase and amplitude information of the transient PCT profiles before dimensionality reduction. DNNs are then trained using PC scores from functional PCA to build surrogate models of TRACE in order to reduce the computational cost in Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. Bayesian neural networks are used to estimate the uncertainties of DNN surrogate model predictions. In this study, we compared four different inverse UQ processes with different dimensionality reduction methods and surrogate models. The proposed approach shows an improvement in reducing the dimension of the TRACE transient simulations, and the forward propagation of inverse UQ results has a better agreement with the experimental data.

A graph is $H$-free if it does not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph. We solve two open problems from the literature by proving that Subset Vertex Cover is NP-complete on subcubic (claw,diamond)-free planar graphs and on $2$-unipolar graphs, a subclass of $2P_3$-free weakly chordal graphs. Our results show for the first time that Subset Vertex Cover is computationally harder than Vertex Cover (under P $\\neq$ NP). We also prove new polynomial time results. We first give a dichotomy on graphs where $G[T]$ is $H$-free. Namely, we show that Subset Vertex Cover is polynomial-time solvable on graphs $G$, for which $G[T]$ is $H$-free, if $H = sP_1 + tP_2$ and NP-complete otherwise. Moreover, we prove that Subset Vertex Cover is polynomial-time solvable for $(sP_1 + P_2 + P_3)$-free graphs and bounded mim-width graphs. By combining our new results with known results we obtain a partial complexity classification for Subset Vertex Cover on $H$-free graphs. ",

There is a pressing need for improved pain treatments and the development of new drugs. Voltage-gated sodium channels, particularly Nav1.3, Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9, play a crucial role in neuronal excitability and are predominantly expressed in the peripheral nervous system. Targeting these channels may provide a means to treat pain while minimizing central and cardiac adverse effects. In this study, we construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks based on pain-related sodium channels and develop a corresponding drug-target interaction (DTI) network to identify potential lead compounds for pain management. To ensure reliable machine learning predictions, we carefully select 111 inhibitor datasets from a pool of over 1,000 targets in the PPI network. We employ three distinct machine learning algorithms combined with advanced natural language processing (NLP)-based embeddings, specifically pre-trained transformer and autoencoder representations. Through a systematic screening process, we evaluate the side effects and repurposing potential of over 150,000 drug candidates targeting Nav1.7 and Nav1.8 sodium channels. Additionally, we assess the ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties of these candidates to identify leads with near-optimal characteristics. Our strategy provides an innovative platform for the pharmacological development of pain treatments, offering the potential for improved efficacy and reduced side effects. ",

Overcoming this sensitivity is central to designing quantum networks capable of transmitting quantum information reliably over large distances. Moreover, the ability to characterize communication noise in quantum networks is crucial in developing network protocols capable of overcoming the effects of noise in quantum networks. In this context, quantum network tomography refers to the characterization of channel noise in a quantum network through end-to-end measurements. In this work, we propose network tomography protocols for quantum star networks formed by quantum channels characterized by a single, non-trivial Pauli operator. Our results further the end-to-end characterization of quantum bit-flip star networks by introducing tomography protocols where state distribution and measurements are designed separately. We build upon previously proposed quantum network tomography protocols, as well as provide novel methods for the unique characterization of bit-flip probabilities in stars. We introduce a theoretical benchmark based on the Quantum Fisher Information matrix to compare the efficiency of quantum network protocols. We apply our techniques to the protocols proposed, and provide an initial analysis on the potential benefits of entanglement for Quantum Network Tomography. Furthermore, we simulate the proposed protocols using NetSquid to assess the convergence properties of the estimators obtained for particular parameter regimes. Our findings show that the efficiency of protocols depend on parameter values and motivate the search for adaptive quantum network tomography protocols. ",

Another is a public dataset of the primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) disease, in which multiple lab tests were longitudinally collected to predict the time-to-liver transplant.

Recently, deep learning-based image post-processing methods along with their dual-domain counterparts have shown promising results. However, existing methods usually produce over-smoothed images with loss of details due to (1) the difficulty in accurately modeling the artifact patterns in the image domain, and (2) the equal treatment of each pixel in the loss function. To address these issues, we concentrate on the image post-processing and propose a simple yet effective FREquency-band-awarE and SElf-guidED network, termed FreeSeed, which can effectively remove artifact and recover missing detail from the contaminated sparse-view CT images. Specifically, we first propose a frequency-band-aware artifact modeling network (FreeNet), which learns artifact-related frequency-band attention in Fourier domain for better modeling the globally distributed streak artifact on the sparse-view CT images. We then introduce a self-guided artifact refinement network (SeedNet), which leverages the predicted artifact to assist FreeNet in continuing to refine the severely corrupted details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of FreeSeed and its dual-domain counterpart over the state-of-the-art sparse-view CT reconstruction methods.

    "abstract": "In many applications, when building linear regression models, it is important to account for the presence of outliers, i.e., corrupted input data points. Such problems can be formulated as mixed-integer optimization problems involving cubic terms, each given by the product of a binary variable and a quadratic term of the continuous variables. Existing approaches in the literature, typically relying on the linearization of the cubic terms using big-M constraints, suffer from weak relaxation and poor performance in practice. In this work we derive stronger second-order conic relaxations that do not involve big-M constraints. Our computational experiments indicate that the proposed formulations are several orders-of-magnitude faster than existing big-M formulations in the literature for this problem. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum Internetworking is a recent field that promises numerous interesting applications, many of which require the distribution of entanglement between arbitrary pairs of users. This work deals with the problem of scheduling in an arbitrary entanglement swapping quantum network - often called first generation quantum network - in its general topology, multicommodity, loss-aware formulation. We introduce a linear algebraic framework that exploits quantum memory through the creation of intermediate entangled links. The framework is then employed to mathematically derive a natural class of quadratic scheduling policies for quantum networks by applying Lyapunov Drift Minimization, a standard technique in classical network science. Moreover, an additional class of Max-Weight inspired policies is proposed and benchmarked, reducing significantly the computation cost, at the price of a slight performance degradation. The policies are compared in terms of information availability, localization and overall network performance through an ad-hoc simulator that admits user-provided network topologies and scheduling policies in order to showcase the potential application of the provided tools to quantum network design.

    "abstract": "Causal disentanglement aims to uncover a representation of data using latent variables that are interrelated through a causal model. Such a representation is identifiable if the latent model that explains the data is unique. In this paper, we focus on the scenario where unpaired observational and interventional data are available, with each intervention changing the mechanism of a latent variable. When the causal variables are fully observed, statistically consistent algorithms have been developed to identify the causal model under faithfulness assumptions. We here show that identifiability can still be achieved with unobserved causal variables, given a generalized notion of faithfulness. Our results guarantee that we can recover the latent causal model up to an equivalence class and predict the effect of unseen combinations of interventions, in the limit of infinite data. We implement our causal disentanglement framework by developing an autoencoding variational Bayes algorithm and apply it to the problem of predicting combinatorial perturbation effects in genomics.
