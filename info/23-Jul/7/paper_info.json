Our work aims to evaluate the effects of adversarial training utilized to produce robust models - less vulnerable to adversarial attacks. It has been shown to make computer vision models more interpretable. Interpretability is as essential as robustness when we deploy the models to the real world. To prove the correlation between these two problems, we extensively examine the models using local feature-importance methods (SHAP, Integrated Gradients) and feature visualization techniques (Representation Inversion, Class Specific Image Generation). Standard models, compared to robust are more susceptible to adversarial attacks, and their learned representations are less meaningful to humans. Conversely, these models focus on distinctive regions of the images which support their predictions. Moreover, the features learned by the robust model are closer to the real ones. ",

    "abstract": "Dynamic graph embedding has emerged as a very effective technique for addressing diverse temporal graph analytic tasks (i.e., link prediction, node classification, recommender systems, anomaly detection, and graph generation) in various applications. Such temporal graphs exhibit heterogeneous transient dynamics, varying time intervals, and highly evolving node features throughout their evolution. Hence, incorporating long-range dependencies from the historical graph context plays a crucial role in accurately learning their temporal dynamics. In this paper, we develop a graph embedding model with uncertainty quantification, TransformerG2G, by exploiting the advanced transformer encoder to first learn intermediate node representations from its current state ($t$) and previous context (over timestamps [$t-1, t-l$], $l$ is the length of context). Moreover, we employ two projection layers to generate lower-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distributions as each node's latent embedding at timestamp $t$. We consider diverse benchmarks with varying levels of ``novelty\" as measured by the TEA plots. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed TransformerG2G model outperforms conventional multi-step methods and our prior work (DynG2G) in terms of both link prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, especially for high degree of novelty. Furthermore, the learned time-dependent attention weights across multiple graph snapshots reveal the development of an automatic adaptive time stepping enabled by the transformer. Importantly, by examining the attention weights, we can uncover temporal dependencies, identify influential elements, and gain insights into the complex interactions within the graph structure. For example, we identified a strong correlation between attention weights and node degree at the various stages of the graph topology evolution. ",

    "abstract": "Opioid related aberrant behaviors (ORAB) present novel risk factors for opioid overdose. Previously, ORAB have been mainly assessed by survey results and by monitoring drug administrations. Such methods however, cannot scale up and do not cover the entire spectrum of aberrant behaviors. On the other hand, ORAB are widely documented in electronic health record notes. This paper introduces a novel biomedical natural language processing benchmark dataset named ODD, for ORAB Detection Dataset. ODD is an expert-annotated dataset comprising of more than 750 publicly available EHR notes. ODD has been designed to identify ORAB from patients' EHR notes and classify them into nine categories; 1) Confirmed Aberrant Behavior, 2) Suggested Aberrant Behavior, 3) Opioids, 4) Indication, 5) Diagnosed opioid dependency, 6) Benzodiapines, 7) Medication Changes, 8) Central Nervous System-related, and 9) Social Determinants of Health. We explored two state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models (finetuning pretrained language models and prompt-tuning approaches) to identify ORAB. Experimental results show that the prompt-tuning models outperformed the finetuning models in most cateogories and the gains were especially higher among uncommon categories (Suggested aberrant behavior, Diagnosed opioid dependency and Medication change). Although the best model achieved the highest 83.92\\% on area under precision recall curve, uncommon classes (Suggested Aberrant Behavior, Diagnosed Opioid Dependence, and Medication Change) still have a large room for performance improvement.

In our evaluation, we compared the performance of the proposed method to that of leading state-of-the-art DNS exfiltration detection methods on real-world datasets comprising over 250 billion DNS queries. The evaluation demonstrates ibHH's ability to successfully detect exfiltration rates as slow as 0.7B/s, with a false positive alert rate of less than 0.004, with significantly lower resource consumption compared to other methods.

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of AI that leverages bodies of documents, known as corpora, to train computers in human-like language understanding. Using a word ranking method, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), to create features across documents, it is possible to perform unsupervised analytics, machine learning (ML) that can group the documents without a human manually labeling the data. For large datasets with thousands of features, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), k-means clustering and Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) are employed to learn top words and generate topics for a Reddit and Twitter combined corpus. Using extremely simple deep learning models, this study demonstrates that the applied results of unsupervised analysis allow a computer to predict either negative, positive, or neutral user sentiment towards plastic surgery based on a tweet or subreddit post with almost 90% accuracy. Furthermore, the model is capable of achieving higher accuracy on the unsupervised sentiment task than on a rudimentary supervised document classification task. Therefore, unsupervised learning may be considered a viable option in labeling social media documents for NLP tasks. ",

Traditional motor-driven systems frequently struggle to balance these competing demands. Addressing this trade-off is crucial for advancing fields such as manufacturing and healthcare, where seamless collaboration between robots and humans is essential. We introduce a four degree-of-freedom (DoF) tendon-driven robot arm, powered by pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs), to tackle this challenge. Our new design features low friction, passive compliance, and inherent impact resilience, enabling rapid, precise, high-force, and safe interactions during dynamic tasks. In addition to fostering safer human-robot collaboration, the inherent safety properties are particularly beneficial for reinforcement learning, where the robot's ability to explore dynamic motions without causing self-damage is crucial. We validate our robotic arm through various experiments, including long-term dynamic motions, impact resilience tests, and assessments of its ease of control. On a challenging dynamic table tennis task, we further demonstrate our robot's capabilities in rapid and precise movements. By showcasing our new design's potential, we aim to inspire further research on robotic systems that balance high performance and safety in diverse tasks.

Representing the signal on a fundamentally different topology introduces edges and distortions which impact network performance. Recently, graph-based approaches have bypassed these challenges to attain significant improvements by representing the signal on a spherical mesh. Current approaches to spherical segmentation exclusively use variants of the UNet architecture, meaning more successful planar architectures remain unexplored. Inspired by the success of feature pyramid networks (FPNs) in planar image segmentation, we leverage the pyramidal hierarchy of graph-based spherical CNNs to design spherical FPNs. Our spherical FPN models show consistent improvements over spherical UNets, whilst using fewer parameters. On the Stanford 2D-3D-S dataset, our models achieve state-of-the-art performance with an mIOU of 48.75, an improvement of 3.75 IoU points over the previous best spherical CNN. ",

    "abstract": "The rising diffusion of information systems (IS) throughout society poses an increasingly serious threat to privacy as a social value. One approach to alleviating this threat is to establish transparency of information privacy practices (TIPP) so that consumers can better understand how their information is processed. However, the design of transparency artifacts (eg, privacy notices) has clearly not followed this approach, given the ever-increasing volume of information processing. Hence, consumers face a situation where they cannot see the 'forest for the trees' when aiming to ascertain whether information processing meets their privacy expectations. A key problem is that overly comprehensive information presentation results in information overload and is thus counterproductive for establishing TIPP. We depart from the extant design logic of transparency artifacts and develop a theoretical foundation (TIPP theory) for transparency artifact designs useful for establishing TIPP from the perspective of privacy as a social value. We present TIPP theory in two parts to capture the sociotechnical interplay. The first part translates abstract knowledge on the IS artifact and privacy into a description of social subsystems of transparency artifacts, and the second part conveys prescriptive design knowledge in form of a corresponding IS design theory. TIPP theory establishes a bridge from the complexity of the privacy concept to a metadesign for transparency artifacts that is useful to establish TIPP in any IS. In essence, transparency artifacts must accomplish more than offering comprehensive information; they must also be adaptive to the current information needs of consumers. ",

Existing detection methods usually only focus on adversarial attacks or out-of-distribution samples as reasons for false predictions. However, generalization errors occur due to diverse reasons often related to poorly learning relevant invariances. We therefore propose GIT, a holistic approach for the detection of generalization errors that combines the usage of gradient information and invariance transformations. The invariance transformations are designed to shift misclassified samples back into the generalization area of the neural network, while the gradient information measures the contradiction between the initial prediction and the corresponding inherent computations of the neural network using the transformed sample. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of GIT compared to the state-of-the-art on a variety of network architectures, problem setups and perturbation types. ",

First, to eliminate the interference of useless images, we propose a pre-filter module to abandon useless images. Second, to make accurate use of useful images, we propose two levels of visual complement modules, word level and phrase level. Specifically, image contributions are calculated and are adopted to guide the attention of both textual and visual modalities. Experimental results have shown that CFSum significantly outperforms multiple strong baselines on the standard benchmark. Furthermore, the analysis verifies that useful images can even help generate non-visual words which are implicitly represented in the image. ",

In response, various deepfake detection methods have been proposed to assess image authenticity. Sequential deepfake detection, which is an extension of deepfake detection, aims to identify forged facial regions with the correct sequence for recovery. Nonetheless, due to the different combinations of spatial and sequential manipulations, forged face images exhibit substantial discrepancies that severely impact detection performance. Additionally, the recovery of forged images requires knowledge of the manipulation model to implement inverse transformations, which is difficult to ascertain as relevant techniques are often concealed by attackers. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Collaboration and Multi-Supervision Network (MMNet) that handles various spatial scales and sequential permutations in forged face images and achieve recovery without requiring knowledge of the corresponding manipulation method. Furthermore, existing evaluation metrics only consider detection accuracy at a single inferring step, without accounting for the matching degree with ground-truth under continuous multiple steps. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel evaluation metric called Complete Sequence Matching (CSM), which considers the detection accuracy at multiple inferring steps, reflecting the ability to detect integrally forged sequences. Extensive experiments on several typical datasets demonstrate that MMNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance and independent recovery performance. ",

We introduce a new dataset of contextually-situated judgments of appropriateness and show that large language models can readily incorporate relationship information to accurately identify appropriateness in a given context. Using data from online conversations and movie dialogues, we provide insight into how the relationships themselves function as implicit norms and quantify the degree to which context-sensitivity is needed in different conversation settings. Further, we also demonstrate that contextual-appropriateness judgments are predictive of other social factors expressed in language such as condescension and politeness. ",

    "title": "Shortest Beer Path Queries based on Graph Decomposition",
    "abstract": "Given a directed edge-weighted graph $G=(V, E)$ with beer vertices $B\\subseteq V$, a beer path between two vertices $u$ and $v$ is a path between $u$ and $v$ that visits at least one beer vertex in $B$, and the beer distance between two vertices is the shortest length of beer paths. We consider \\emph{indexing problems} on beer paths, that is, a graph is given a priori, and we construct some data structures (called indexes) for the graph. Then later, we are given two vertices, and we find the beer distance or beer path between them using the data structure. For such a scheme, efficient algorithms using indexes for the beer distance and beer path queries have been proposed for outerplanar graphs and interval graphs. For example, Bacic et al. (2021) present indexes with size $O(n)$ for outerplanar graphs and an algorithm using them that answers the beer distance between given two vertices in $O(\\alpha(n))$ time, where $\\alpha(\\cdot)$ is the inverse Ackermann function; the performance is shown to be optimal. This paper proposes indexing data structures and algorithms for beer path queries on general graphs based on two types of graph decomposition: the tree decomposition and the triconnected component decomposition. We propose indexes with size $O(m+nr^2)$ based on the triconnected component decomposition, where $r$ is the size of the largest triconnected component. For a given query $u,v\\in V$, our algorithm using the indexes can output the beer distance in query time $O(\\alpha(m))$. In particular, our indexing data structures and algorithms achieve the optimal performance (the space and the query time) for series-parallel graphs, which is a wider class of outerplanar graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples crafted by adding human-imperceptible perturbations to the benign input. After achieving nearly 100% attack success rates in white-box setting, more focus is shifted to black-box attacks, of which the transferability of adversarial examples has gained significant attention. In either case, the common gradient-based methods generally use the sign function to generate perturbations on the gradient update, that offers a roughly correct direction and has gained great success. But little work pays attention to its possible limitation. In this work, we observe that the deviation between the original gradient and the generated noise may lead to inaccurate gradient update estimation and suboptimal solutions for adversarial transferability. To this end, we propose a Sampling-based Fast Gradient Rescaling Method (S-FGRM). Specifically, we use data rescaling to substitute the sign function without extra computational cost. We further propose a Depth First Sampling method to eliminate the fluctuation of rescaling and stabilize the gradient update. Our method could be used in any gradient-based attacks and is extensible to be integrated with various input transformation or ensemble methods to further improve the adversarial transferability. Extensive experiments on the standard ImageNet dataset show that our method could significantly boost the transferability of gradient-based attacks and outperform the state-of-the-art baselines. ",

In this study, a reconstruction-based method using the noise-to-norm paradigm is proposed, which avoids the invariant reconstruction of anomalous regions. Our reconstruction network is based on M-net and incorporates multiscale fusion and residual attention modules to enable end-to-end anomaly detection and localization. Experiments demonstrate that the method is effective in reconstructing anomalous regions into normal patterns and achieving accurate anomaly detection and localization.

In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for news summary generation using LLM with powerful natural language understanding and generative capabilities. We use LLM to extract multiple structured event patterns from the events contained in news paragraphs, evolve the event pattern population with genetic algorithm, and select the most adaptive event pattern to input into the LLM to generate news summaries. A News Summary Generator (NSG) is designed to select and evolve the event pattern populations and generate news summaries.

The recent progress made on distributed representation and neural networks continues to improve the state-of-the-art performance of natural language inference.

Adversarial attacks have proven to be an important tool to help evaluate the Achilles' heel of the victim models. In this study, we explore the fundamental problem of developing attack models based on logic formalism. We propose NatLogAttack to perform systematic attacks centring around natural logic, a classical logic formalism that is traceable back to Aristotle's syllogism and has been closely developed for natural language inference. The proposed framework renders both label-preserving and label-flipping attacks. We show that compared to the existing attack models, NatLogAttack generates better adversarial examples with fewer visits to the victim models. The victim models are found to be more vulnerable under the label-flipping setting. NatLogAttack provides a tool to probe the existing and future NLI models' capacity from a key viewpoint and we hope more logic-based attacks will be further explored for understanding the desired property of reasoning.

Any organisational plan that intends to be successful at managing security risks must clearly understand the harm (i.e., negative impact) and the various parties affected in the aftermath of an attack. To this end, this article conducts a novel exploration into the multitude of real-world harms that can arise from cyber-attacks, with a particular focus on ransomware incidents given their current prominence. This exploration also leads to the proposal of a new, robust methodology for modelling harms from such incidents. We draw on publicly-available case data on high-profile ransomware incidents to examine the types of harm that emerge at various stages after a ransomware attack and how harms (e.g., an offline enterprise server) may trigger other negative, potentially more substantial impacts for stakeholders (e.g., the inability for a customer to access their social welfare benefits or bank account). Prominent findings from our analysis include the identification of a notable set of social/human harms beyond the business itself (and beyond the financial payment of a ransom) and a complex web of harms that emerge after attacks regardless of the industry sector. We also observed that deciphering the full extent and sequence of harms can be a challenging undertaking because of the lack of complete data available. This paper consequently argues for more transparency on ransomware harms, as it would lead to a better understanding of the realities of these incidents to the benefit of organisations and society more generally.

ValiTex consists of two components, a conceptual model, and a dynamic checklist. Whereas the conceptual model provides a general structure along distinct phases on how to approach validation, the dynamic checklist defines specific validation steps and provides guidance on which steps might be considered recommendable (i.e., providing relevant and necessary validation evidence) or optional (i.e., useful for providing additional supporting validation evidence.

In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised terrain traversability learning framework, utilizing a contrastive label disambiguation mechanism. Firstly, weakly labeled training samples with pseudo labels are automatically generated by projecting actual driving experiences onto the terrain models constructed in real time. Subsequently, a prototype-based contrastive representation learning method is designed to learn distinguishable embeddings, facilitating the self-supervised updating of those pseudo labels. As the iterative interaction between representation learning and pseudo label updating, the ambiguities in those pseudo labels are gradually eliminated, enabling the learning of platform-specific and task-specific traversability without any human-provided annotations.

The results show that the models used in the experiments improve in terms of training speed and performance when fed with feature correlation matrices rather than with feature vectors. The relative reduction of the error rate ranges between 23.1% and 26.6% depending on the model. The probable explanation is that feature correlation matrices appear to be more variable in the case of depressed speakers.

    "abstract": "Textual noise, such as typos or abbreviations, is a well-known issue that penalizes vanilla Transformers for most downstream tasks. We show that this is also the case for sentence similarity, a fundamental task in multiple domains, e.g. matching, retrieval or paraphrasing. Sentence similarity can be approached using cross-encoders, where the two sentences are concatenated in the input allowing the model to exploit the inter-relations between them. Previous works addressing the noise issue mainly rely on data augmentation strategies, showing improved robustness when dealing with corrupted samples that are similar to the ones used for training. However, all these methods still suffer from the token distribution shift induced by typos. In this work, we propose to tackle textual noise by equipping cross-encoders with a novel LExical-aware Attention module (LEA) that incorporates lexical similarities between words in both sentences. By using raw text similarities, our approach avoids the tokenization shift problem obtaining improved robustness. We demonstrate that the attention bias introduced by LEA helps cross-encoders to tackle complex scenarios with textual noise, specially in domains with short-text descriptions and limited context. Experiments using three popular Transformer encoders in five e-commerce datasets for product matching show that LEA consistently boosts performance under the presence of noise, while remaining competitive on the original (clean) splits. We also evaluate our approach in two datasets for textual entailment and paraphrasing showing that LEA is robust to typos in domains with longer sentences and more natural context. Additionally, we thoroughly analyze several design choices in our approach, providing insights about the impact of the decisions made and fostering future research in cross-encoders dealing with typos.

Recently, Transformer-based models have shown competitive performance in RSISR. To mitigate the quadratic computational complexity resulting from global self-attention, various methods constrain attention to a local window, enhancing its efficiency. Consequently, the receptive fields in a single attention layer are inadequate, leading to insufficient context modeling. Furthermore, while most transform-based approaches reuse shallow features through skip connections, relying solely on these connections treats shallow and deep features equally, impeding the model's ability to characterize them. To address these issues, we propose a novel transformer architecture called Cross-Spatial Pixel Integration and Cross-Stage Feature Fusion Based Transformer Network (SPIFFNet) for RSISR. Our proposed model effectively enhances global cognition and understanding of the entire image, facilitating efficient integration of features cross-stages. The model incorporates cross-spatial pixel integration attention (CSPIA) to introduce contextual information into a local window, while cross-stage feature fusion attention (CSFFA) adaptively fuses features from the previous stage to improve feature expression in line with the requirements of the current stage.

    "abstract": "Disease detection from smartphone data represents an open research challenge in mobile health (m-health) systems. COVID-19 and its respiratory symptoms are an important case study in this area and their early detection is a potential real instrument to counteract the pandemic situation. The efficacy of this solution mainly depends on the performances of AI algorithms applied to the collected data and their possible implementation directly on the users' mobile devices. Considering these issues, and the limited amount of available data, in this paper we present the experimental evaluation of 3 different deep learning models, compared also with hand-crafted features, and of two main approaches of transfer learning in the considered scenario: both feature extraction and fine-tuning. Specifically, we considered VGGish, YAMNET, and L\\textsuperscript{3}-Net (including 12 different configurations) evaluated through user-independent experiments on 4 different datasets (13,447 samples in total). Results clearly show the advantages of L\\textsuperscript{3}-Net in all the experimental settings as it overcomes the other solutions by 12.3\\% in terms of Precision-Recall AUC as features extractor, and by 10\\% when the model is fine-tuned. Moreover, we note that to fine-tune only the fully-connected layers of the pre-trained models generally leads to worse performances, with an average drop of 6.6\\% with respect to feature extraction. %highlighting the need for further investigations. Finally, we evaluate the memory footprints of the different models for their possible applications on commercial mobile devices. ",

    "abstract": "Manual assembly workers face increasing complexity in their work. Human-centered assistance systems could help, but object recognition as an enabling technology hinders sophisticated human-centered design of these systems. At the same time, activity recognition based on hand poses suffers from poor pose estimation in complex usage scenarios, such as wearing gloves. This paper presents a self-supervised pipeline for adapting hand pose estimation to specific use cases with minimal human interaction. This enables cheap and robust hand posebased activity recognition. The pipeline consists of a general machine learning model for hand pose estimation trained on a generalized dataset, spatial and temporal filtering to account for anatomical constraints of the hand, and a retraining step to improve the model. Different parameter combinations are evaluated on a publicly available and annotated dataset. The best parameter and model combination is then applied to unlabelled videos from a manual assembly scenario. The effectiveness of the pipeline is demonstrated by training an activity recognition as a downstream task in the manual assembly scenario. ",

    "abstract": "There are two major challenges for scaling up robot navigation around dynamic obstacles: the complex interaction dynamics of the obstacles can be hard to model analytically, and the complexity of planning and control grows exponentially in the number of obstacles. Data-driven and learning-based methods are thus particularly valuable in this context. However, data-driven methods are sensitive to distribution drift, making it hard to train and generalize learned models across different obstacle densities. We propose a novel method for compositional learning of Sequential Neural Control Barrier models (SNCBFs) to achieve scalability. Our approach exploits an important observation: the spatial interaction patterns of multiple dynamic obstacles can be decomposed and predicted through temporal sequences of states for each obstacle. Through decomposition, we can generalize control policies trained only with a small number of obstacles, to environments where the obstacle density can be 100x higher. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed methods in improving dynamic collision avoidance in comparison with existing methods including potential fields, end-to-end reinforcement learning, and model-predictive control. We also perform hardware experiments and show the practical effectiveness of the approach in the supplementary video. ",

It has been shown that OTSM is capable of attaining a bit error ratio (BER) similar to that of orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation at a lower complexity, since the saving of multiplication operations in the IWHT. Hence we provide its BER performance analysis and characterize its detection complexity. We commence by deriving its generalized input-output relationship and its unconditional pairwise error probability (UPEP). Then, its BER upper bound is derived in closed form under both ideal and imperfect channel estimation conditions, which is shown to be tight at moderate to high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Moreover, a novel approximate message passing (AMP) aided OTSM detection framework is proposed. Specifically, to circumvent the high residual BER of the conventional AMP detector, we proposed a vector AMP-based expectation-maximization (VAMP-EM) detector for performing joint data detection and noise variance estimation. The variance auto-tuning algorithm based on the EM algorithm is designed for the VAMP-EM detector to further improve the convergence performance. The simulation results illustrate that the VAMP-EM detector is capable of striking an attractive BER vs. complexity trade-off than the state-of-the-art schemes as well as providing a better convergence. Finally, we propose AMP and VAMP-EM turbo receivers for low-density parity-check (LDPC)-coded OTSM systems. It is demonstrated that our proposed VAMP-EM turbo receiver is capable of providing both BER and convergence performance improvements over the conventional AMP solution. ",

In this context, the main goal is to design an automated model that can assess emotional states. Lately, deep neural networks have shown promising performance in emotion recognition tasks.

Here, we introduce a deep neural network that acquires interpretable physiological representations by a hybrid structure of spatio-temporal encoding and recurrent attention network blocks. Furthermore, a preprocessing step is applied to the raw data using graph signal processing tools to perform graph smoothing in the spatial domain.

To explore the generality of the learned model, we also evaluate the performance of our architecture towards transfer learning (TL) by transferring the model parameters from a specific source to other target domains. Using DEAP as the source dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in performing cross-modality TL and improving emotion classification accuracy on DREAMER and the Emotional English Word (EEWD) datasets, which involve EEG-based emotion classification tasks with different stimuli.

    "abstract": "Signed graphs are complex systems that represent trust relationships or preferences in various domains. Learning node representations in such graphs is crucial for many mining tasks. Although real-world signed relationships can be influenced by multiple latent factors, most existing methods often oversimplify the modeling of signed relationships by relying on social theories and treating them as simplistic factors. This limits their expressiveness and their ability to capture the diverse factors that shape these relationships. In this paper, we propose DINES, a novel method for learning disentangled node representations in signed directed graphs without social assumptions. We adopt a disentangled framework that separates each embedding into distinct factors, allowing for capturing multiple latent factors. We also explore lightweight graph convolutions that focus solely on sign and direction, without depending on social theories. Additionally, we propose a decoder that effectively classifies an edge's sign by considering correlations between the factors. To further enhance disentanglement, we jointly train a self-supervised factor discriminator with our encoder and decoder. Throughout extensive experiments on real-world signed directed graphs, we show that DINES effectively learns disentangled node representations, and significantly outperforms its competitors in the sign prediction task.

The local student, which is used in previous studies mainly focuses on structural anomaly detection while the global student pays attention to logical anomalies. To further encourage the global student's learning to capture long-range dependencies, we design the global context condensing block (GCCB) and propose a contextual affinity loss for the student training and anomaly scoring.

However, the standard as-it-is is not sufficient to support the real deployment of networking solutions entirely based on D2D such as opportunistic networks. In fact, WiFi Direct presents some characteristics that could limit the autonomous creation of D2D connections among users' personal devices. Specifically, the standard explicitly requires the user's authorization to establish a connection between two or more devices, and it provides a limited support for inter-group communication. In some cases, this might lead to the creation of isolated groups of nodes which cannot communicate among each other. In this paper, we propose a novel middleware-layer protocol for the efficient configuration and management of WiFi Direct groups (WiFi Direct Group Manager, WFD-GM) to enable autonomous connections and inter-group communication. This enables opportunistic networks in real conditions (e.g., variable mobility and network size). WFD-GM defines a context function that takes into account heterogeneous parameters for the creation of the best group configuration in a specific time window, including an index of nodes' stability and power levels. We evaluate the protocol performances by simulating three reference scenarios including different mobility models, geographical areas and number of nodes. Simulations are also supported by experimental results related to the evaluation in a real testbed of the involved context parameters. We compare WFD-GM with the state-of-the-art solutions and we show that it performs significantly better than a Baseline approach in scenarios with medium/low mobility, and it is comparable with it in case of high mobility, without introducing additional overhead.

However, determining high-resolution conductivity maps from only a few induced magnetic field measurements is an ill-posed inverse problem.

The PSM prediction is needed for acquiring the PSM for the unseen image, but its prediction is still a challenging task due to the complexity of individual gaze patterns. For recognizing individual gaze patterns from the limited amount of eye-tracking data, the previous methods adopt the similarity of gaze tendency between persons. However, in the previous methods, the PSMs are vectorized for the prediction model. In this way, the structural global information of the PSMs corresponding to the image is ignored. For automatically revealing the relationship between PSMs, we focus on the tensor-based regression model that can preserve the structural information of PSMs, and realize the improvement of the prediction accuracy.

However, obtaining accurate measurements for all compounds of interest is not possible due to the resource and labor intensity of experiments.

In this paper, we propose PUFFIN (Path-Unifying Feed-Forward Interfaced Network), a machine learning framework that combines transfer learning with a new inductive bias node inspired by domain knowledge (the Antoine equation) to improve vapor pressure prediction. By leveraging inductive bias and transfer learning using graph embeddings, PUFFIN outperforms alternative strategies that do not use inductive bias or that use generic descriptors of compounds. The framework's incorporation of domain-specific knowledge to overcome the limitation of poor data availability shows its potential for broader applications in chemical compound analysis, including the prediction of other physicochemical properties. Importantly, our proposed machine learning framework is partially interpretable, because the inductive Antoine node yields network-derived Antoine equation coefficients. It would then be possible to directly incorporate the obtained analytical expression in process design software for better prediction and control of processes occurring in industry and the environment.

    "title": "SegNetr: Rethinking the local-global interactions and skip connections  in U-shaped networks",
    "abstract": "Recently, U-shaped networks have dominated the field of medical image segmentation due to their simple and easily tuned structure. However, existing U-shaped segmentation networks: 1) mostly focus on designing complex self-attention modules to compensate for the lack of long-term dependence based on convolution operation, which increases the overall number of parameters and computational complexity of the network; 2) simply fuse the features of encoder and decoder, ignoring the connection between their spatial locations. In this paper, we rethink the above problem and build a lightweight medical image segmentation network, called SegNetr. Specifically, we introduce a novel SegNetr block that can perform local-global interactions dynamically at any stage and with only linear complexity. At the same time, we design a general information retention skip connection (IRSC) to preserve the spatial location information of encoder features and achieve accurate fusion with the decoder features. We validate the effectiveness of SegNetr on four mainstream medical image segmentation datasets, with 59\\% and 76\\% fewer parameters and GFLOPs than vanilla U-Net, while achieving segmentation performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, the components proposed in this paper can be applied to other U-shaped networks to improve their segmentation performance. ",

    "title": "Fourier-Net+: Leveraging Band-Limited Representation for Efficient 3D  Medical Image Registration",
    "abstract": "U-Net style networks are commonly utilized in unsupervised image registration to predict dense displacement fields, which for high-resolution volumetric image data is a resource-intensive and time-consuming task. To tackle this challenge, we first propose Fourier-Net, which replaces the costly U-Net style expansive path with a parameter-free model-driven decoder. Instead of directly predicting a full-resolution displacement field, our Fourier-Net learns a low-dimensional representation of the displacement field in the band-limited Fourier domain which our model-driven decoder converts to a full-resolution displacement field in the spatial domain. Expanding upon Fourier-Net, we then introduce Fourier-Net+, which additionally takes the band-limited spatial representation of the images as input and further reduces the number of convolutional layers in the U-Net style network's contracting path. Finally, to enhance the registration performance, we propose a cascaded version of Fourier-Net+. We evaluate our proposed methods on three datasets, on which our proposed Fourier-Net and its variants achieve comparable results with current state-of-the art methods, while exhibiting faster inference speeds, lower memory footprint, and fewer multiply-add operations. With such small computational cost, our Fourier-Net+ enables the efficient training of large-scale 3D registration on low-VRAM GPUs.

    "title": "Self-supervised learning via inter-modal reconstruction and feature  projection networks for label-efficient 3D-to-2D segmentation",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has become a valuable tool for the automation of certain medical image segmentation tasks, significantly relieving the workload of medical specialists. Some of these tasks require segmentation to be performed on a subset of the input dimensions, the most common case being 3D-to-2D. However, the performance of existing methods is strongly conditioned by the amount of labeled data available, as there is currently no data efficient method, e.g. transfer learning, that has been validated on these tasks. In this work, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) and self-supervised learning (SSL) method for label-efficient 3D-to-2D segmentation. The CNN is composed of a 3D encoder and a 2D decoder connected by novel 3D-to-2D blocks. The SSL method consists of reconstructing image pairs of modalities with different dimensionality. The approach has been validated in two tasks with clinical relevance: the en-face segmentation of geographic atrophy and reticular pseudodrusen in optical coherence tomography. Results on different datasets demonstrate that the proposed CNN significantly improves the state of the art in scenarios with limited labeled data by up to 8% in Dice score. Moreover, the proposed SSL method allows further improvement of this performance by up to 23%, and we show that the SSL is beneficial regardless of the network architecture. ",

Advantages of the proposed method are guaranteed and fast local convergence also for problems with non-convex constraints. Moreover, our method exhibits a small communication footprint and it achieves a comparably high solution accuracy with a limited number of iterations, whereby the local subproblems are of low computational complexity. We illustrate the performance of the proposed method on a problem from energy systems, i.e., we consider an optimal power flow problem with 708 buses. ",

As a consequence, every equilibrium refinement violates at least one of these properties. We moreover show that every solution concept that approximately satisfies consequentialism, consistency, and rationality returns approximate Nash equilibria. The latter approximation can be made arbitrarily good by increasing the approximation of the axioms. This result extends to various natural subclasses of games such as two-player zero-sum games, potential games, and graphical games. ",

    "abstract": "Feature bagging is a well-established ensembling method which aims to reduce prediction variance by training estimators in an ensemble on random subsamples or projections of features. Typically, ensembles are chosen to be homogeneous, in the sense the the number of feature dimensions available to an estimator is uniform across the ensemble. Here, we introduce heterogeneous feature ensembling, with estimators built on varying number of feature dimensions, and consider its performance in a linear regression setting. We study an ensemble of linear predictors, each fit using ridge regression on a subset of the available features. We allow the number of features included in these subsets to vary. Using the replica trick from statistical physics, we derive learning curves for ridge ensembles with deterministic linear masks. We obtain explicit expressions for the learning curves in the case of equicorrelated data with an isotropic feature noise. Using the derived expressions, we investigate the effect of subsampling and ensembling, finding sharp transitions in the optimal ensembling strategy in the parameter space of noise level, data correlations, and data-task alignment. Finally, we suggest variable-dimension feature bagging as a strategy to mitigate double descent for robust machine learning in practice. ",
