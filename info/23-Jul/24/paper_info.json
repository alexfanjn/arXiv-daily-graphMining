    "abstract": "Handwriting authentication is a valuable tool used in various fields, such as fraud prevention and cultural heritage protection. However, it remains a challenging task due to the complex features, severe damage, and lack of supervision. In this paper, we propose a novel Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning framework for Robust Handwriting Authentication (CSSL-RHA) to address these issues. It can dynamically learn complex yet important features and accurately predict writer identities. Specifically, to remove the negative effects of imperfections and redundancy, we design an information-theoretic filter for pre-processing and propose a novel adaptive matching scheme to represent images as patches of local regions dominated by more important features. Through online optimization at inference time, the most informative patch embeddings are identified as the \"most important\" elements. Furthermore, we employ contrastive self-supervised training with a momentum-based paradigm to learn more general statistical structures of handwritten data without supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets and our manually annotated dataset EN-HA, which demonstrate the superiority of our CSSL-RHA compared to baselines. Additionally, we show that our proposed model can still effectively achieve authentication even under abnormal circumstances, such as data falsification and corruption. ",

    "title": "Comparison between transformers and convolutional models for  fine-grained classification of insects",
    "abstract": "Fine-grained classification is challenging due to the difficulty of finding discriminatory features. This problem is exacerbated when applied to identifying species within the same taxonomical class. This is because species are often sharing morphological characteristics that make them difficult to differentiate. We consider the taxonomical class of Insecta. The identification of insects is essential in biodiversity monitoring as they are one of the inhabitants at the base of many ecosystems. Citizen science is doing brilliant work of collecting images of insects in the wild giving the possibility to experts to create improved distribution maps in all countries. We have billions of images that need to be automatically classified and deep neural network algorithms are one of the main techniques explored for fine-grained tasks. At the SOTA, the field of deep learning algorithms is extremely fruitful, so how to identify the algorithm to use? We focus on Odonata and Coleoptera orders, and we propose an initial comparative study to analyse the two best-known layer structures for computer vision: transformer and convolutional layers. We compare the performance of T2TViT, a fully transformer-base, EfficientNet, a fully convolutional-base, and ViTAE, a hybrid. We analyse the performance of the three models in identical conditions evaluating the performance per species, per morph together with sex, the inference time, and the overall performance with unbalanced datasets of images from smartphones. Although we observe high performances with all three families of models, our analysis shows that the hybrid model outperforms the fully convolutional-base and fully transformer-base models on accuracy performance and the fully transformer-base model outperforms the others on inference speed and, these prove the transformer to be robust to the shortage of samples and to be faster at inference time.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of exact community recovery in the Geometric Stochastic Block Model (GSBM), where each vertex has an unknown community label as well as a known position, generated according to a Poisson point process in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Edges are formed independently conditioned on the community labels and positions, where vertices may only be connected by an edge if they are within a prescribed distance of each other. The GSBM thus favors the formation of dense local subgraphs, which commonly occur in real-world networks, a property that makes the GSBM qualitatively very different from the standard Stochastic Block Model (SBM). We propose a linear-time algorithm for exact community recovery, which succeeds down to the information-theoretic threshold, confirming a conjecture of Abbe, Baccelli, and Sankararaman. The algorithm involves two phases. The first phase exploits the density of local subgraphs to propagate estimated community labels among sufficiently occupied subregions, and produces an almost-exact vertex labeling. The second phase then refines the initial labels using a Poisson testing procedure. Thus, the GSBM enjoys local to global amplification just as the SBM, with the advantage of admitting an information-theoretically optimal, linear-time algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "Background: Mental illness can lead to adverse outcomes such as homelessness and police interaction and understanding of the events leading up to these adverse outcomes is important. Predictive models may help identify individuals at risk of such adverse outcomes. Using a fixed observation window cohort with logistic regression (LR) or machine learning (ML) models can result in lower performance when compared with adaptive and parcellated windows. Method: An administrative healthcare dataset was used, comprising of 240,219 individuals in Calgary, Alberta, Canada who were diagnosed with addiction or mental health (AMH) between April 1, 2013, and March 31, 2018. The cohort was followed for 2 years to identify factors associated with homelessness and police interactions. To understand the benefit of flexible windows to predictive models, an alternative cohort was created. Then LR and ML models, including random forests (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were compared in the two cohorts. Results: Among 237,602 individuals, 0.8% (1,800) experienced first homelessness, while 0.32% (759) reported initial police interaction among 237,141 individuals. Male sex (AORs: H=1.51, P=2.52), substance disorder (AORs: H=3.70, P=2.83), psychiatrist visits (AORs: H=1.44, P=1.49), and drug abuse (AORs: H=2.67, P=1.83) were associated with initial homelessness (H) and police interaction (P). XGBoost showed superior performance using the flexible method (sensitivity =91%, AUC =90% for initial homelessness, and sensitivity =90%, AUC=89% for initial police interaction) Conclusion: This study identified key features associated with initial homelessness and police interaction and demonstrated that flexible windows can improve predictive modeling.

Many GCNs can be understood as a form of generalized diffusion of input features on the graph, and significant work has been dedicated to improving predictive accuracy by altering the ways of message passing. In this work, we propose a new convolution kernel that effectively rewires the graph according to the occupation correlations of the vertices by trading on the generalized diffusion paradigm for the propagation of a quantum particle over the graph. We term this new convolution kernel the Quantum Diffusion Convolution (QDC) operator. In addition, we introduce a multiscale variant that combines messages from the QDC operator and the traditional combinatorial Laplacian. To understand our method, we explore the spectral dependence of homophily and the importance of quantum dynamics in the construction of a bandpass filter. Through these studies, as well as experiments on a range of datasets, we observe that QDC improves predictive performance on the widely used benchmark datasets when compared to similar methods. ",

    "abstract": "The ability to envision future states is crucial to informed decision making while interacting with dynamic environments. With cameras providing a prevalent and information rich sensing modality, the problem of predicting future states from image sequences has garnered a lot of attention. Current state of the art methods typically train large parametric models for their predictions. Though often able to predict with accuracy, these models rely on the availability of large training datasets to converge to useful solutions. In this paper we focus on the problem of predicting future images of an image sequence from very little training data. To approach this problem, we use non-parametric models to take a probabilistic approach to image prediction. We generate probability distributions over sequentially predicted images and propagate uncertainty through time to generate a confidence metric for our predictions. Gaussian Processes are used for their data efficiency and ability to readily incorporate new training data online. We showcase our method by successfully predicting future frames of a smooth fluid simulation environment. ",

The metric does not require access to the training data sampling or model training algorithm. Epsilon* is a function of true positive and false positive rates in a hypothesis test used by an adversary in a membership inference attack. We distinguish between quantifying the privacy loss of a trained model instance and quantifying the privacy loss of the training mechanism which produces this model instance. Existing approaches in the privacy auditing literature provide lower bounds for the latter, while our metric provides a lower bound for the former by relying on an (${\\epsilon}$,${\\delta}$)-type of quantification of the privacy of the trained model instance. We establish a relationship between these lower bounds and show how to implement Epsilon* to avoid numerical and noise amplification instability. We further show in experiments on benchmark public data sets that Epsilon* is sensitive to privacy risk mitigation by training with differential privacy (DP), where the value of Epsilon* is reduced by up to 800% compared to the Epsilon* values of non-DP trained baseline models. This metric allows privacy auditors to be independent of model owners, and enables all decision-makers to visualize the privacy-utility landscape to make informed decisions regarding the trade-offs between model privacy and utility.

Despite extensive study on this topic, the fairness of ML models in the software engineering (SE) domain has not been well explored yet. As a result, many ML-powered software systems, particularly those utilized in the software engineering community, continue to be prone to fairness issues. Taking one of the typical SE tasks, i.e., code reviewer recommendation, as a subject, this paper conducts the first study toward investigating the issue of fairness of ML applications in the SE domain. Our empirical study demonstrates that current state-of-the-art ML-based code reviewer recommendation techniques exhibit unfairness and discriminating behaviors. Specifically, male reviewers get on average 7.25% more recommendations than female code reviewers compared to their distribution in the reviewer set. This paper also discusses the reasons why the studied ML-based code reviewer recommendation systems are unfair and provides solutions to mitigate the unfairness. Our study further indicates that the existing mitigation methods can enhance fairness by 100% in projects with a similar distribution of protected and privileged groups, but their effectiveness in improving fairness on imbalanced or skewed data is limited. Eventually, we suggest a solution to overcome the drawbacks of existing mitigation techniques and tackle bias in datasets that are imbalanced or skewed. ",

The signed distance function (SDF) field and radiance field then predict their SDFs and colors, respectively, with which RGBD images can be synthesized via differentiable volume rendering. We constrain the learned shape by tailoring multiple regularization strategies and disentangling geometry and appearance. Experiments on public endoscope datasets demonstrate that EndoSurf significantly outperforms existing solutions, particularly in reconstructing high-fidelity shapes.

Our empirical findings demonstrate that: 1) the combination of Bayesian formulations for both the model input and model parameters yields significant improvements in transferability; 2) by introducing advanced approximations of the posterior distribution over the model input, adversarial transferability achieves further enhancement, surpassing all state-of-the-arts when attacking without model fine-tuning. Moreover, we propose a principled approach to fine-tune model parameters in such an extended Bayesian formulation.

To this end, we propose a novel Tri-Mip encoding that enables both instant reconstruction and anti-aliased high-fidelity rendering for neural radiance fields. The key is to factorize the pre-filtered 3D feature spaces in three orthogonal mipmaps. In this way, we can efficiently perform 3D area sampling by taking advantage of 2D pre-filtered feature maps, which significantly elevates the rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency. To cope with the novel Tri-Mip representation, we propose a cone-casting rendering technique to efficiently sample anti-aliased 3D features with the Tri-Mip encoding considering both pixel imaging and observing distance. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and reconstruction speed while maintaining a compact representation that reduces 25% model size compared against Instant-ngp.

These clusters are usually equipped with host CPUs and accelerators with distinct responsibilities to handle serving requests, i.e. generalpurpose CPUs for input preprocessing and domain-specific GPUs for forward computation. Recurrent neural networks play an essential role in handling temporal inputs and display distinctive computation characteristics because of their high inter-operator parallelism. Hence, we propose Chrion to optimize recurrent neural network inference by collaboratively utilizing CPUs and GPUs. We formulate the model deployment in the CPU-GPU cluster as an NP-hard scheduling problem of directed acyclic graphs on heterogeneous devices. Given an input model in the ONNX format and user-defined SLO requirement, Chrion firstly preprocesses the model by model parsing and profiling, and then partitions the graph to select execution devices for each operator. When an online request arrives, Chrion performs forward computation according to the graph partition by executing the operators on the CPU and GPU in parallel. Our experimental results show that the execution time can be reduced by 19.4% at most in the latency-optimal pattern and GPU memory footprint by 67.5% in the memory-optimal pattern compared with the execution on the GPU.

    "abstract": "Graph domain adaptation models are widely adopted in cross-network learning tasks, with the aim of transferring labeling or structural knowledge. Currently, there mainly exist two limitations in evaluating graph domain adaptation models. On one side, they are primarily tested for the specific cross-network node classification task, leaving tasks at edge-level and graph-level largely under-explored. Moreover, they are primarily tested in limited scenarios, such as social networks or citation networks, lacking validation of model's capability in richer scenarios. As comprehensively assessing models could enhance model practicality in real-world applications, we propose a benchmark, known as OpenGDA. It provides abundant pre-processed and unified datasets for different types of tasks (node, edge, graph). They originate from diverse scenarios, covering web information systems, urban systems and natural systems. Furthermore, it integrates state-of-the-art models with standardized and end-to-end pipelines. Overall, OpenGDA provides a user-friendly, scalable and reproducible benchmark for evaluating graph domain adaptation models. The benchmark experiments highlight the challenges of applying GDA models to real-world applications with consistent good performance, and potentially provide insights to future research. As an emerging project, OpenGDA will be regularly updated with new datasets and models. It could be accessed from https://github.com/Skyorca/OpenGDA. ",

    "abstract": "Object detection is the key technique to a number of Computer Vision applications, but it often requires large amounts of annotated data to achieve decent results. Moreover, for pedestrian detection specifically, the collected data might contain some personally identifiable information (PII), which is highly restricted in many countries. This label intensive and privacy concerning task has recently led to an increasing interest in training the detection models using synthetically generated pedestrian datasets collected with a photo-realistic video game engine. The engine is able to generate unlimited amounts of data with precise and consistent annotations, which gives potential for significant gains in the real-world applications. However, the use of synthetic data for training introduces a synthetic-to-real domain shift aggravating the final performance. To close the gap between the real and synthetic data, we propose to use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which performsparameterized unpaired image-to-image translation to generate more realistic images. The key benefit of using the GAN is its intrinsic preference of low-level changes to geometric ones, which means annotations of a given synthetic image remain accurate even after domain translation is performed thus eliminating the need for labeling real data. We extensively experimented with the proposed method using MOTSynth dataset to train and MOT17 and MOT20 detection datasets to test, with experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of this method. Our approach not only produces visually plausible samples but also does not require any labels of the real domain thus making it applicable to the variety of downstream tasks. ",

However, standard DA produces synthetic data for augmentation with limited diversity. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may unlock additional information in a dataset by generating synthetic samples having the appearance of real images. However, these models struggle to simultaneously address three key requirements: fidelity and high-quality samples; diversity and mode coverage; and fast sampling. Indeed, GANs generate high-quality samples rapidly, but have poor mode coverage, limiting their adoption in DA applications. We propose LatentAugment, a DA strategy that overcomes the low diversity of GANs, opening up for use in DA applications. Without external supervision, LatentAugment modifies latent vectors and moves them into latent space regions to maximise the synthetic images' diversity and fidelity. It is also agnostic to the dataset and the downstream task. A wide set of experiments shows that LatentAugment improves the generalisation of a deep model translating from MRI-to-CT beating both standard DA as well GAN-based sampling. Moreover, still in comparison with GAN-based sampling, LatentAugment synthetic samples show superior mode coverage and diversity. Code is available at: https://github.com/ltronchin/LatentAugment. ",

Recently, deep SNNs trained directly have shown great success in achieving high performance on classification tasks with very few time steps. However, how to design a directly-trained SNN for the regression task of object detection still remains a challenging problem. To address this problem, we propose EMS-YOLO, a novel directly-trained SNN framework for object detection, which is the first trial to train a deep SNN with surrogate gradients for object detection rather than ANN-SNN conversion strategies. Specifically, we design a full-spike residual block, EMS-ResNet, which can effectively extend the depth of the directly-trained SNN with low power consumption. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze and prove the EMS-ResNet could avoid gradient vanishing or exploding. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art ANN-SNN conversion methods (at least 500 time steps) in extremely fewer time steps (only 4 time steps). It is shown that our model could achieve comparable performance to the ANN with the same architecture while consuming 5.83 times less energy on the frame-based COCO Dataset and the event-based Gen1 Dataset.

However, existing manipulation methods require extensive human labor, such as a user-provided semantic mask and manual attribute search unsuitable for non-expert users. Instead, our approach is designed to require a single text to manipulate a face reconstructed with NeRF. To do so, we first train a scene manipulator, a latent code-conditional deformable NeRF, over a dynamic scene to control a face deformation using the latent code. However, representing a scene deformation with a single latent code is unfavorable for compositing local deformations observed in different instances. As so, our proposed Position-conditional Anchor Compositor (PAC) learns to represent a manipulated scene with spatially varying latent codes. Their renderings with the scene manipulator are then optimized to yield high cosine similarity to a target text in CLIP embedding space for text-driven manipulation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to address the text-driven manipulation of a face reconstructed with NeRF. Extensive results, comparisons, and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. ",

Existing forgery detection methods suffer from unsatisfactory generalization ability to determine the authenticity in the unseen domain. In this paper, we propose a novel Attention Consistency Refined masked frequency forgery representation model toward generalizing face forgery detection algorithm (ACMF). Most forgery technologies always bring in high-frequency aware cues, which make it easy to distinguish source authenticity but difficult to generalize to unseen artifact types. The masked frequency forgery representation module is designed to explore robust forgery cues by randomly discarding high-frequency information. In addition, we find that the forgery attention map inconsistency through the detection network could affect the generalizability. Thus, the forgery attention consistency is introduced to force detectors to focus on similar attention regions for better generalization ability. Experiment results on several public face forgery datasets (FaceForensic++, DFD, Celeb-DF, and WDF datasets) demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Although existing studies have identified many patterns in the PDR process, they fall short of describing how individual recoveries contribute to the overall recovery of the system. To enhance the understanding of individual return behavior and the recovery of point-of-interests (POIs), we propose an agent-based model (ABM), called PostDisasterSim. We apply the model to analyze the recovery of five counties in Texas following Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Specifically, we construct a three-layer network comprising the human layer, the social infrastructure layer, and the physical infrastructure layer, using mobile phone location data and POI data. Based on prior studies and a household survey, we develop the ABM to simulate how evacuated individuals return to their homes, and social and physical infrastructures recover. By implementing the ABM, we unveil the heterogeneity in recovery dynamics in terms of agent types, housing types, household income levels, and geographical locations. Moreover, simulation results across nine scenarios quantitatively demonstrate the positive effects of social and physical infrastructure improvement plans. This study can assist disaster scientists in uncovering nuanced recovery patterns and policymakers in translating policies like resource allocation into practice. ",

    "abstract": "Achieving accurate material segmentation for 3-channel RGB images is challenging due to the considerable variation in a material's appearance. Hyperspectral images, which are sets of spectral measurements sampled at multiple wavelengths, theoretically offer distinct information for material identification, as variations in intensity of electromagnetic radiation reflected by a surface depend on the material composition of a scene. However, existing hyperspectral datasets are impoverished regarding the number of images and material categories for the dense material segmentation task, and collecting and annotating hyperspectral images with a spectral camera is prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose a new model, the MatSpectNet to segment materials with recovered hyperspectral images from RGB images. The network leverages the principles of colour perception in modern cameras to constrain the reconstructed hyperspectral images and employs the domain adaptation method to generalise the hyperspectral reconstruction capability from a spectral recovery dataset to material segmentation datasets. The reconstructed hyperspectral images are further filtered using learned response curves and enhanced with human perception. The performance of MatSpectNet is evaluated on the LMD dataset as well as the OpenSurfaces dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that MatSpectNet attains a 1.60% increase in average pixel accuracy and a 3.42% improvement in mean class accuracy compared with the most recent publication.

However, the research on 6G is still in its infancy, and only the first steps have been taken to conceptualize its design, investigate its implementation, and plan for use cases. Toward this end, academia and industry communities have gradually shifted from theoretical studies of AI distribution to real-world deployment and standardization. Still, designing an end-to-end framework that systematizes the AI distribution by allowing easier access to the service using a third-party application assisted by a zero-touch service provisioning has not been well explored. In this context, we introduce a novel platform architecture to deploy a zero-touch PAI-as-a-Service (PAIaaS) in 6G networks supported by a blockchain-based smart system. This platform aims to standardize the pervasive AI at all levels of the architecture and unify the interfaces in order to facilitate the service deployment across application and infrastructure domains, relieve the users worries about cost, security, and resource allocation, and at the same time, respect the 6G stringent performance requirements.

In recent years, various datasets and debiasing methods have been proposed to evaluate and enhance the VQA robustness, respectively. This paper provides the first comprehensive survey focused on this emerging fashion.

Then, we examine the evaluation metrics employed by these datasets. Thirdly, we propose a typology that presents the development process, similarities and differences, robustness comparison, and technical features of existing debiasing methods. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss the robustness of representative vision-and-language pre-training models on VQA.

However, the existing BEV-based multi-view 3D detectors generally transform all image features into BEV features, without considering the problem that the large proportion of background information may submerge the object information. In this paper, we propose Semantic-Aware BEV Pooling (SA-BEVPool), which can filter out background information according to the semantic segmentation of image features and transform image features into semantic-aware BEV features. Accordingly, we propose BEV-Paste, an effective data augmentation strategy that closely matches with semantic-aware BEV feature. In addition, we design a Multi-Scale Cross-Task (MSCT) head, which combines task-specific and cross-task information to predict depth distribution and semantic segmentation more accurately, further improving the quality of semantic-aware BEV feature.

In this study, we propose Redemption from Range-view R-CNN (R2 R-CNN), a novel and accurate approach that comprehensively explores the range-view representation. Our proposed method addresses scale variation through the HD Meta Kernel, which captures range-view geometry information in multiple scales. Additionally, we introduce Feature Points Redemption (FPR) to recover the lost 3D surface texture information from the range view, and Synchronous-Grid RoI Pooling (S-Grid RoI Pooling), a multi-scaled approach with multiple receptive fields for accurate box refinement. Our R2 R-CNN outperforms existing range-view-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the KITTI benchmark and the Waymo Open Dataset.

Experiments from an agent-based model suggest that friction alone decreases the number of posts without improving their quality. A small amount of friction combined with learning, however, increases the average quality of posts significantly. Based on this preliminary evidence, we propose a friction intervention with a learning component about the platform's community standards, to be tested via a field experiment.

    "abstract": "This paper contributes a novel and modularized learning-based method for aerial robots navigating cluttered environments containing hard-to-perceive thin obstacles without assuming access to a map or the full pose estimation of the robot. The proposed solution builds upon a semantically-enhanced Variational Autoencoder that is trained with both real-world and simulated depth images to compress the input data, while preserving semantically-labeled thin obstacles and handling invalid pixels in the depth sensor's output. This compressed representation, in addition to the robot's partial state involving its linear/angular velocities and its attitude are then utilized to train an uncertainty-aware 3D Collision Prediction Network in simulation to predict collision scores for candidate action sequences in a predefined motion primitives library. A set of simulation and experimental studies in cluttered environments with various sizes and types of obstacles, including multiple hard-to-perceive thin objects, were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method and compare against an end-to-end trained baseline. The results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed semantically-enhanced deep collision prediction for learning-based autonomous navigation. ",

    "abstract": "Viewpoint invariance remains challenging for visual recognition in the 3D world, as altering the viewing directions can significantly impact predictions for the same object. While substantial efforts have been dedicated to making neural networks invariant to 2D image translations and rotations, viewpoint invariance is rarely investigated. Motivated by the success of adversarial training in enhancing model robustness, we propose Viewpoint-Invariant Adversarial Training (VIAT) to improve the viewpoint robustness of image classifiers. Regarding viewpoint transformation as an attack, we formulate VIAT as a minimax optimization problem, where the inner maximization characterizes diverse adversarial viewpoints by learning a Gaussian mixture distribution based on the proposed attack method GMVFool. The outer minimization obtains a viewpoint-invariant classifier by minimizing the expected loss over the worst-case viewpoint distributions that can share the same one for different objects within the same category. Based on GMVFool, we contribute a large-scale dataset called ImageNet-V+ to benchmark viewpoint robustness. Experimental results show that VIAT significantly improves the viewpoint robustness of various image classifiers based on the diversity of adversarial viewpoints generated by GMVFool. Furthermore, we propose ViewRS, a certified viewpoint robustness method that provides a certified radius and accuracy to demonstrate the effectiveness of VIAT from the theoretical perspective. ",

Many established approaches rely on predicting 2D-3D keypoint correspondences using RANSAC (Random sample consensus) and estimating the object pose using the PnP (Perspective-n-Point) algorithm. Being RANSAC non-differentiable, correspondences cannot be directly learned in an end-to-end fashion. In this paper, we address the stereo image-based object pose estimation problem by (i) introducing a differentiable RANSAC layer into a well-known monocular pose estimation network; (ii) exploiting an uncertainty-driven multi-view PnP solver which can fuse information from multiple views. We evaluate our approach on a challenging public stereo object pose estimation dataset, yielding state-of-the-art results against other recent approaches. Furthermore, in our ablation study, we show that the differentiable RANSAC layer plays a significant role in the accuracy of the proposed method.

Their key component is a classification module that continuously evaluates some features of the network traffic and identifies possible threats. Its efficiency is greatly affected by the right selection of the features to be monitored. Therefore, the identification of a minimal set of features that are necessary to safely distinguish malicious traffic from benign traffic is indispensable in the course of the development of an IDS. This paper presents the preprocessing and feature selection workflow as well as its results in the case of the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 on AWS dataset, focusing on five attack types. To identify the relevant features, six feature selection methods were applied, and the final ranking of the features was elaborated based on their average score. Next, several subsets of the features were formed based on different ranking threshold values, and each subset was tried with five classification algorithms to determine the optimal feature set for each attack type. During the evaluation, four widely used metrics were taken into consideration. ",

During the testing process, test cases that have been fuzzed or selected using test metrics are fed into the model to find fault-inducing test units (e.g., neurons and feature maps, activating which will almost certainly result in a model error) and report them to the DNN developer, who subsequently repair them~(e.g., retraining the model with test cases). Current test metrics, however, are primarily concerned with the neurons, which means that test cases that are discovered either by guided fuzzing or selection with these metrics focus on detecting fault-inducing neurons while failing to detect fault-inducing feature maps. In this work, we propose DeepFeature, which tests DNNs from the feature map level. When testing is conducted, DeepFeature will scrutinize every internal feature map in the model and identify vulnerabilities that can be enhanced through repairing to increase the model's overall performance. Exhaustive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that (1) DeepFeature is a strong tool for detecting the model's vulnerable feature maps; (2) DeepFeature's test case selection has a high fault detection rate and can detect more types of faults~(comparing DeepFeature to coverage-guided selection techniques, the fault detection rate is increased by 49.32\\%).

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have been widely used in many critical applications, such as autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis. However, their security is threatened by backdoor attack, which is achieved by adding artificial patterns to specific training data. Existing defense strategies primarily focus on using reverse engineering to reproduce the backdoor trigger generated by attackers and subsequently repair the DNN model by adding the trigger into inputs and fine-tuning the model with ground-truth labels. However, once the trigger generated by the attackers is complex and invisible, the defender can not successfully reproduce the trigger. Consequently, the DNN model will not be repaired since the trigger is not effectively removed. In this work, we propose Feature Map Testing~(FMT). Different from existing defense strategies, which focus on reproducing backdoor triggers, FMT tries to detect the backdoor feature maps, which are trained to extract backdoor information from the inputs. After detecting these backdoor feature maps, FMT will erase them and then fine-tune the model with a secure subset of training data. Our experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing defense strategies, FMT can effectively reduce the Attack Success Rate (ASR) even against the most complex and invisible attack triggers. Second, unlike conventional defense methods that tend to exhibit low Robust Accuracy (i.e., the model's accuracy on the poisoned data), FMT achieves higher RA, indicating its superiority in maintaining model performance while mitigating the effects of backdoor attacks~(e.g., FMT obtains 87.40\\% RA in CIFAR10). Third, compared to existing feature map pruning techniques, FMT can cover more backdoor feature maps~(e.g., FMT removes 83.33\\% of backdoor feature maps from the model in the CIFAR10 \\& BadNet scenario).

For an extended period of time, increasing the model complexity has led to performance improvements for various tasks. However, this trend is becoming unsustainable and there is a need for alternative, computationally lighter methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for efficient training of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for large-scale spatial problems. To accomplish this we investigate the properties of CNNs for tasks where the underlying signals are stationary. We show that a CNN trained on small windows of such signals achieves a nearly performance on much larger windows without retraining. This claim is supported by our theoretical analysis, which provides a bound on the performance degradation. Additionally, we conduct thorough experimental analysis on two tasks: multi-target tracking and mobile infrastructure on demand. Our results show that the CNN is able to tackle problems with many hundreds of agents after being trained with fewer than ten. Thus, CNN architectures provide solutions to these problems at previously computationally intractable scales. ",

    "abstract": "Social isolation is caused by the impoverishment of community (atomism) and fragmentation is caused by the enlargement of in-group (mobism), both of which can be viewed as social problems related to communication. To solve these problems, the philosophical world has proposed the concept of \"mixbiotic society,\" in which individuals with freedom and diverse values mix and mingle to recognize their respective \"fundamental incapability\" each other and sublimate into solidarity. Based on this concept, this study proposes new mixbiotic society measures to evaluate dynamic communication patterns with reference to classification in cellular automata and particle reaction diffusion that simulate living phenomena. Specifically, the hypothesis of measures corresponding to the four classes was formulated, and the hypothesis was validated by simulating the generation and disappearance of communication. As a result, considering communication patterns as multidimensional vectors, it found that the mean of Euclidean distance for \"mobism,\" the variance of the relative change in distance for \"atomism,\" the composite measure that multiplies the mean and variance of cosine similarity for \"mixism,\" which corresponds to the well-going of mixbiotic society, and the almost zero measures for \"nihilism,\" are suitable. Then, evaluating seven real-society datasets using these measures, we showed that the mixism measure is useful for assessing the livingness of communication, and that it is possible to typify communities based on plural measures. The measures established in this study are superior to conventional analysis in that they can evaluate dynamic patterns, they are simple to calculate, and their meanings are easy to interpret. As a future development, the mixbiotic society measures will be used in the fields of digital democracy and platform cooperativism toward a desirable society. ",

We propose a Robust Fully-Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Tracking method (R-FAST), where each device performs local computation and communication at its own pace without any form of synchronization. Different from existing asynchronous distributed algorithms, R-FAST can eliminate the impact of data heterogeneity across devices and allow for packet losses by employing a robust gradient tracking strategy that relies on properly designed auxiliary variables for tracking and buffering the overall gradient vector. More importantly, the proposed method utilizes two spanning-tree graphs for communication so long as both share at least one common root, enabling flexible designs in communication architectures. We show that R-FAST converges in expectation to a neighborhood of the optimum with a geometric rate for smooth and strongly convex objectives; and to a stationary point with a sublinear rate for general non-convex settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that R-FAST runs 1.5-2 times faster than synchronous benchmark algorithms, such as Ring-AllReduce and D-PSGD, while still achieving comparable accuracy, and outperforms existing asynchronous SOTA algorithms, such as AD-PSGD and OSGP, especially in the presence of stragglers.

Traditional methods are less robust against attacks. Recent DNN-based methods either introduce excessive distortions or fail to embed the watermark without the help of texture information. However, embedding the watermark in textures is insecure because replacing the texture image can completely remove the watermark. In this paper, we propose a robust deep 3D mesh watermarking WM-NET, which leverages attention-based convolutions in watermarking tasks to embed binary messages in vertex distributions without texture assistance. Furthermore, our WM-NET exploits the property that simplified meshes inherit similar relations from the original ones, where the relation is the offset vector directed from one vertex to its neighbor. By doing so, our method can be trained on simplified meshes(limited data) but remains effective on large-sized meshes (size adaptable) and unseen categories of meshes (geometry adaptable). Extensive experiments demonstrate our method brings 50% fewer distortions and 10% higher bit accuracy compared to previous work. Our watermark WM-NET is robust against various mesh attacks, e.g. Gauss, rotation, translation, scaling, and cropping. ",

Given that joint state space grows exponentially with the number of agents in multi-agent systems, existing researches still relying on single-agent option discovery either become prohibitive or fail to directly discover joint options that improve the connectivity of the joint state space. In this paper, we show how to directly compute multi-agent options with collaborative exploratory behaviors while still enjoying the ease of decomposition. Our key idea is to approximate the joint state space as a Kronecker graph, based on which we can directly estimate its Fiedler vector using the Laplacian spectrum of individual agents' transition graphs. Further, considering that directly computing the Laplacian spectrum is intractable for tasks with infinite-scale state spaces, we further propose a deep learning extension of our method by estimating eigenfunctions through NN-based representation learning techniques. The evaluation on multi-agent tasks built with simulators like Mujoco, shows that the proposed algorithm can successfully identify multi-agent options, and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Specifically, can we construct a distance oracle with multiplicative stretch better than 2, along with some additive stretch, while maintaining subquadratic space complexity? This question remains a crucial area of investigation, and finding a positive answer would be a significant step forward for distance oracles. Indeed, such oracles have been constructed for sparse graphs. However, in the more general case of dense graphs, it is currently unknown whether such oracles exist. In this paper, we contribute to the field by presenting the first distance oracles that achieve a multiplicative stretch of $1+\\varepsilon$ along with a small additive stretch while maintaining subquadratic space complexity. Our results represent an advancement particularly for constructing efficient distance oracles for dense graphs.

    "abstract": "Predicting synergistic drug combinations can help accelerate discovery of cancer treatments, particularly therapies personalized to a patient's specific tumor via biopsied cells. In this paper, we propose a novel setting and models for in-context drug synergy learning. We are given a small \"personalized dataset\" of 10-20 drug synergy relationships in the context of specific cancer cell targets. Our goal is to predict additional drug synergy relationships in that context. Inspired by recent work that pre-trains a GPT language model (LM) to \"in-context learn\" common function classes, we devise novel pre-training schemes that enable a GPT model to in-context learn \"drug synergy functions\". Our model -- which does not use any textual corpora, molecular fingerprints, protein interaction or any other domain-specific knowledge -- is able to achieve competitive results. We further integrate our in-context approach with a genetic algorithm to optimize model prompts and select synergy candidates to test after conducting a patient biopsy. Finally, we explore a novel task of inverse drug design which can potentially enable the design of drugs that synergize specifically to target a given patient's \"personalized dataset\". Our findings can potentially have an important impact on precision cancer medicine, and also raise intriguing questions on non-textual pre-training for LMs. ",

The proposed pipeline generates skeletal grapevine models that have lower reprojection error and higher connectivity than baseline algorithms. We also show how 3D and skeletal information enables prediction accuracy of pruning weight for dense vines surpassing prior work, where pruning weight is an important vine metric influencing pruning site selection.

    "abstract": "Source code summarization is the task of writing natural language descriptions of source code behavior. Code summarization underpins software documentation for programmers. Short descriptions of code help programmers understand the program quickly without having to read the code itself. Lately, neural source code summarization has emerged as the frontier of research into automated code summarization techniques. By far the most popular targets for summarization are program subroutines. The idea, in a nutshell, is to train an encoder-decoder neural architecture using large sets of examples of subroutines extracted from code repositories. The encoder represents the code and the decoder represents the summary. However, most current approaches attempt to treat the subroutine as a single unit. For example, by taking the entire subroutine as input to a Transformer or RNN-based encoder. But code behavior tends to depend on the flow from statement to statement. Normally dynamic analysis may shed light on this flow, but dynamic analysis on hundreds of thousands of examples in large datasets is not practical. In this paper, we present a statement-based memory encoder that learns the important elements of flow during training, leading to a statement-based subroutine representation without the need for dynamic analysis. We implement our encoder for code summarization and demonstrate a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art. ",

For computational reasons, the Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance was introduced as an alternative to the Wasserstein distance, and has seen uses for training generative Neural Networks (NNs). While convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has been observed practically in such a setting, there is to our knowledge no theoretical guarantee for this observation. Leveraging recent works on convergence of SGD on non-smooth and non-convex functions by Bianchi et al. (2022), we aim to bridge that knowledge gap, and provide a realistic context under which fixed-step SGD trajectories for the SW loss on NN parameters converge. More precisely, we show that the trajectories approach the set of (sub)-gradient flow equations as the step decreases. Under stricter assumptions, we show a much stronger convergence result for noised and projected SGD schemes, namely that the long-run limits of the trajectories approach a set of generalised critical points of the loss function.

We present a collection of datasets for three relation prediction tasks - protein-protein interaction prediction, gene-disease association prediction and disease prediction - that aim at circumventing the difficulties in building benchmarks for knowledge graphs with negative statements. These datasets include data from two successful biomedical ontologies, Gene Ontology and Human Phenotype Ontology, enriched with negative statements. We also generate knowledge graph embeddings for each dataset with two popular path-based methods and evaluate the performance in each task. The results show that the negative statements can improve the performance of knowledge graph embeddings. ",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved human-level fluency in text generation, making it difficult to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated texts. This poses a growing risk of misuse of LLMs and demands the development of detectors to identify LLM-generated texts. However, existing detectors degrade detection accuracy by simply paraphrasing LLM-generated texts. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these detectors in real-life situations, such as when students use LLMs for writing homework assignments (e.g., essays) and quickly learn how to evade these detectors, has not been explored. In this paper, we propose OUTFOX, a novel framework that improves the robustness of LLM-generated-text detectors by allowing both the detector and the attacker to consider each other's output and apply this to the domain of student essays. In our framework, the attacker uses the detector's prediction labels as examples for in-context learning and adversarially generates essays that are harder to detect. While the detector uses the adversarially generated essays as examples for in-context learning to learn to detect essays from a strong attacker. Our experiments show that our proposed detector learned in-context from the attacker improves the detection performance on the attacked dataset by up to +41.3 point F1-score. While our proposed attacker can drastically degrade the performance of the detector by up to -57.0 point F1-score compared to the paraphrasing method. ",

    "abstract": "The rise of Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has enabled the training of machine learning models across federated participants, fostering decentralized model aggregation and reducing dependence on a server. However, this approach introduces unique communication security challenges that have yet to be thoroughly addressed in the literature. These challenges primarily originate from the decentralized nature of the aggregation process, the varied roles and responsibilities of the participants, and the absence of a central authority to oversee and mitigate threats. Addressing these challenges, this paper first delineates a comprehensive threat model, highlighting the potential risks of DFL communications. In response to these identified risks, this work introduces a security module designed for DFL platforms to counter communication-based attacks. The module combines security techniques such as symmetric and asymmetric encryption with Moving Target Defense (MTD) techniques, including random neighbor selection and IP/port switching. The security module is implemented in a DFL platform called Fedstellar, allowing the deployment and monitoring of the federation. A DFL scenario has been deployed, involving eight physical devices implementing three security configurations: (i) a baseline with no security, (ii) an encrypted configuration, and (iii) a configuration integrating both encryption and MTD techniques. The effectiveness of the security module is validated through experiments with the MNIST dataset and eclipse attacks. The results indicated an average F1 score of 95%, with moderate increases in CPU usage (up to 63.2% +-3.5%) and network traffic (230 MB +-15 MB) under the most secure configuration, mitigating the risks posed by eavesdropping or eclipse attacks.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a frequency-aware super-resolution framework that integrates three critical frequency-based modules (i.e., frequency transformation, frequency skip connection, and frequency alignment) and frequency-based loss function into a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). We conducted a large-scale quantitative study from an existing coronary OCT dataset to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over existing deep learning frameworks. In addition, we confirmed the generalizability of our framework by applying it to fish corneal images and rat retinal images, demonstrating its capability to super-resolve morphological details in eye imaging.

Recent analysis of fMRI data models the brain as a graph and extracts features by graph neural networks (GNNs). However, the unique characteristics of fMRI data require a special design of GNN. Tailoring GNN to generate effective and domain-explainable features remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a contrastive dual-attention block and a differentiable graph pooling method called ContrastPool to better utilize GNN for brain networks, meeting fMRI-specific requirements. We apply our method to 5 resting-state fMRI brain network datasets of 3 diseases and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art baselines. Our case study confirms that the patterns extracted by our method match the domain knowledge in neuroscience literature, and disclose direct and interesting insights.

A novel backstepping transformation, composed of two Volterra transformations and an affine Volterra transformation, is introduced for the predictive control design. The resulting kernel equations from the affine Volterra transformation are two coupled first-order PDEs and each with two boundary conditions, which brings challenges to the well-posedness analysis. We solve the challenge by using the method of characteristics and the successive approximation. To analyze the sensitivity of the closed-loop system to uncertain input delay, we introduce a neutral system which captures the control effect resulted from the delay uncertainty. It is proved that the proposed control is robust to small delay variations. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of the proposed compensator. ",
