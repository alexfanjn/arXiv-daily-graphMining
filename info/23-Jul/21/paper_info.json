    "abstract": "We examine the privacy-enhancing properties of subsampling a data set via importance sampling as a pre-processing step for differentially private mechanisms. This extends the established privacy amplification by subsampling result to importance sampling where each data point is weighted by the reciprocal of its selection probability. The implications for privacy of weighting each point are not obvious. On the one hand, a lower selection probability leads to a stronger privacy amplification. On the other hand, the higher the weight, the stronger the influence of the point on the output of the mechanism in the event that the point does get selected. We provide a general result that quantifies the trade-off between these two effects. We show that heterogeneous sampling probabilities can lead to both stronger privacy and better utility than uniform subsampling while retaining the subsample size. In particular, we formulate and solve the problem of privacy-optimal sampling, that is, finding the importance weights that minimize the expected subset size subject to a given privacy budget. Empirically, we evaluate the privacy, efficiency, and accuracy of importance sampling-based privacy amplification on the example of k-means clustering. ",

    "abstract": "Network Intrusion Detection (NID) works as a kernel technology for the security network environment, obtaining extensive research and application. Despite enormous efforts by researchers, NID still faces challenges in deploying on resource-constrained devices. To improve detection accuracy while reducing computational costs and model storage simultaneously, we propose a lightweight intrusion detection approach based on self-knowledge distillation, namely LNet-SKD, which achieves the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, we carefully design the DeepMax block to extract compact representation efficiently and construct the LNet by stacking DeepMax blocks. Furthermore, considering compensating for performance degradation caused by the lightweight network, we adopt batch-wise self-knowledge distillation to provide the regularization of training consistency. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed LNet-SKD, which outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques with fewer parameters and lower computation loads. ",

    "abstract": "As CryptoPunks pioneers the innovation of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in AI and art, the valuation mechanics of NFTs has become a trending topic. Earlier research identifies the impact of ethics and society on the price prediction of CryptoPunks. Since the booming year of the NFT market in 2021, the discussion of CryptoPunks has propagated on social media. Still, existing literature hasn't considered the social sentiment factors after the historical turning point on NFT valuation. In this paper, we study how sentiments in social media, together with gender and skin tone, contribute to NFT valuations by an empirical analysis of social media, blockchain, and crypto exchange data. We evidence social sentiments as a significant contributor to the price prediction of CryptoPunks. Furthermore, we document structure changes in the valuation mechanics before and after 2021. Although people's attitudes towards Cryptopunks are primarily positive, our findings reflect imbalances in transaction activities and pricing based on gender and skin tone. Our result is consistent and robust, controlling for the rarity of an NFT based on the set of human-readable attributes, including gender and skin tone. Our research contributes to the interdisciplinary study at the intersection of AI, Ethics, and Society, focusing on the ecosystem of decentralized AI or blockchain.

Compared with conventional adversarial training on balanced datasets, this process falls into the dilemma of generating uneven adversarial examples (AEs) and an unbalanced feature embedding space, causing the resulting model to exhibit low robustness and accuracy on tail data. To combat that, we propose a new adversarial training framework -- Re-balancing Adversarial Training (REAT). This framework consists of two components: (1) a new training strategy inspired by the term effective number to guide the model to generate more balanced and informative AEs; (2) a carefully constructed penalty function to force a satisfactory feature space. Evaluation results on different datasets and model structures prove that REAT can effectively enhance the model's robustness and preserve the model's clean accuracy.

This paper takes a further step by computing 3D primal sketch of wireframes from a set of images with known camera poses, in which we take the 2D wireframes in multi-view images as the basis to compute 3D wireframes in a volumetric rendering formulation. In our method, we first propose a NEural Attraction (NEAT) Fields that parameterizes the 3D line segments with coordinate Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), enabling us to learn the 3D line segments from 2D observation without incurring any explicit feature correspondences across views. We then present a novel Global Junction Perceiving (GJP) module to perceive meaningful 3D junctions from the NEAT Fields of 3D line segments by optimizing a randomly initialized high-dimensional latent array and a lightweight decoding MLP. Benefitting from our explicit modeling of 3D junctions, we finally compute the primal sketch of 3D wireframes by attracting the queried 3D line segments to the 3D junctions, significantly simplifying the computation paradigm of 3D wireframe parsing. In experiments, we evaluate our approach on the DTU and BlendedMVS datasets with promising performance obtained. As far as we know, our method is the first approach to achieve high-fidelity 3D wireframe parsing without requiring explicit matching. ",

Despite the success of deep models in load disaggregation, they face various challenges, particularly those pertaining to privacy and security. This paper investigates the sensitivity of prominent deep NILM baselines to adversarial attacks, which have proven to be a significant threat in domains such as computer vision and speech recognition. Adversarial attacks entail the introduction of imperceptible noise into the input data with the aim of misleading the neural network into generating erroneous outputs. We investigate the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), a well-known adversarial attack, to perturb the input sequences fed into two commonly employed CNN-based NILM baselines: the Sequence-to-Sequence (S2S) and Sequence-to-Point (S2P) models. Our findings provide compelling evidence for the vulnerability of these models, particularly the S2P model which exhibits an average decline of 20\\% in the F1-score even with small amounts of noise. Such weakness has the potential to generate profound implications for energy management systems in residential and industrial sectors reliant on NILM models. ",

    "abstract": "Stemming from traditional knowledge graphs (KGs), hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) provide additional key-value pairs (i.e., qualifiers) for each KG fact that help to better restrict the fact validity. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in studying graph reasoning over HKGs. In the meantime, due to the ever-evolving nature of world knowledge, extensive parallel works have been focusing on reasoning over temporal KGs (TKGs), where each TKG fact can be viewed as a KG fact coupled with a timestamp (or time period) specifying its time validity. The existing HKG reasoning approaches do not consider temporal information because it is not explicitly specified in previous benchmark datasets. Besides, all the previous TKG reasoning methods only lay emphasis on temporal reasoning and have no way to learn from qualifiers. To this end, we aim to fill the gap between TKG reasoning and HKG reasoning. We develop two new benchmark hyper-relational TKG (HTKG) datasets, i.e., Wiki-hy and YAGO-hy, and propose a HTKG reasoning model that efficiently models both temporal facts and qualifiers. We further exploit additional time-invariant relational knowledge from the Wikidata knowledge base and study its effectiveness in HTKG reasoning. Time-invariant relational knowledge serves as the knowledge that remains unchanged in time (e.g., Sasha Obama is the child of Barack Obama), and it has never been fully explored in previous TKG reasoning benchmarks and approaches. Experimental results show that our model substantially outperforms previous related methods on HTKG link prediction and can be enhanced by jointly leveraging both temporal and time-invariant relational knowledge.

We show that both causal logic and language C can be extended to allow values from arbitrary nonempty sets. Our extension of language C, called C+, also makes it possible to describe actions in terms of their attributes, which is important from the perspective of elaboration tolerance. We describe an embedding of C+ in causal theories with multi-valued constants, relate C+ to Pednault's action language ADL, and show how multi-valued constants can be eliminated in favor of Boolean constants.

Although many efforts have been devoted to making neural networks invariant to 2D image translations and rotations, viewpoint invariance is rarely investigated. As most models process images in the perspective view, it is challenging to impose invariance to 3D viewpoint changes based only on 2D inputs. Motivated by the success of adversarial training in promoting model robustness, we propose Viewpoint-Invariant Adversarial Training (VIAT) to improve viewpoint robustness of common image classifiers. By regarding viewpoint transformation as an attack, VIAT is formulated as a minimax optimization problem, where the inner maximization characterizes diverse adversarial viewpoints by learning a Gaussian mixture distribution based on a new attack GMVFool, while the outer minimization trains a viewpoint-invariant classifier by minimizing the expected loss over the worst-case adversarial viewpoint distributions. To further improve the generalization performance, a distribution sharing strategy is introduced leveraging the transferability of adversarial viewpoints across objects. Experiments validate the effectiveness of VIAT in improving the viewpoint robustness of various image classifiers based on the diversity of adversarial viewpoints generated by GMVFool. ",

    "abstract": "Face recognition from image sets acquired under unregulated and uncontrolled settings, such as at large distances, low resolutions, varying viewpoints, illumination, pose, and atmospheric conditions, is challenging. Face feature aggregation, which involves aggregating a set of N feature representations present in a template into a single global representation, plays a pivotal role in such recognition systems. Existing works in traditional face feature aggregation either utilize metadata or high-dimensional intermediate feature representations to estimate feature quality for aggregation. However, generating high-quality metadata or style information is not feasible for extremely low-resolution faces captured in long-range and high altitude settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a feature distribution conditioning approach called CoNAN for template aggregation. Specifically, our method aims to learn a context vector conditioned over the distribution information of the incoming feature set, which is utilized to weigh the features based on their estimated informativeness. The proposed method produces state-of-the-art results on long-range unconstrained face recognition datasets such as BTS, and DroneSURF, validating the advantages of such an aggregation strategy. ",

However, previous radar-camera fusion models have not been able to fully utilize radar information in that initial 3D proposals were generated based on the camera features only and the instance-level fusion is subsequently conducted. In this paper, we propose radar-camera multi-level fusion (RCM-Fusion), which fuses radar and camera modalities at both the feature-level and instance-level to fully utilize radar information. At the feature-level, we propose a Radar Guided BEV Encoder which utilizes radar Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features to transform image features into precise BEV representations and then adaptively combines the radar and camera BEV features. At the instance-level, we propose a Radar Grid Point Refinement module that reduces localization error by considering the characteristics of the radar point clouds. The experiments conducted on the public nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our proposed RCM-Fusion offers 11.8% performance gain in nuScenes detection score (NDS) over the camera-only baseline model and achieves state-of-the-art performaces among radar-camera fusion methods in the nuScenes 3D object detection benchmark.

An accurate and timely threat attribution plays an important role in deterring future attacks by applying appropriate and timely defense mechanisms. Manual analysis of attack patterns gathered by honeypot deployments, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and via trace-back procedures is still the preferred method of security analysts for cyber threat attribution. Such attack patterns are low-level Indicators of Compromise (IOC). They represent Tactics, Techniques, Procedures (TTP), and software tools used by the adversaries in their campaigns. The adversaries rarely re-use them. They can also be manipulated, resulting in false and unfair attribution. To empirically evaluate and compare the effectiveness of both kinds of IOC, there are two problems that need to be addressed. The first problem is that in recent research works, the ineffectiveness of low-level IOC for cyber threat attribution has been discussed intuitively. An empirical evaluation for the measure of the effectiveness of low-level IOC based on a real-world dataset is missing. The second problem is that the available dataset for high-level IOC has a single instance for each predictive class label that cannot be used directly for training machine learning models. To address these problems in this research work, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of low-level IOC based on a real-world dataset that is specifically built for comparative analysis with high-level IOC. The experimental results show that the high-level IOC trained models effectively attribute cyberattacks with an accuracy of 95% as compared to the low-level IOC trained models where accuracy is 40%.

In this research, we compare boosted HMMs (using AdaBoost) to HMMs trained with multiple random restarts, in the context of malware detection. These techniques are applied to a variety of challenging malware datasets. We find that random restarts perform surprisingly well in comparison to boosting.

As a solution to this challenge, an integrated receiver (IR) architecture has been proposed, and, in turn, various SWIPT modulation schemes compatible with the IR architecture have been developed. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research has been conducted on modulation scheduling in SWIPT-based IoT sensor networks while taking into account the IR architecture. Accordingly, in this paper, we address this research gap by studying the problem of joint scheduling for unicast/multicast, IoT sensor, and modulation (UMSM) in a time-slotted SWIPT-based IoT sensor network system. To this end, we leverage mathematical modeling and optimization techniques, such as the Lagrangian duality and stochastic optimization theory, to develop an UMSM scheduling algorithm that maximizes the weighted sum of average unicast service throughput and harvested energy of IoT sensors, while ensuring the minimum average throughput of both multicast and unicast, as well as the minimum average harvested energy of IoT sensors. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive simulations that our UMSM scheduling algorithm achieves superior energy harvesting (EH) and throughput performance while ensuring the satisfaction of specified constraints well.

With respect to RT's communication strategy, our findings hint at a lack of a coherent strategy in RT's targeting of audiences in different languages, evident through differences in tag usage, clustering patterns, and uneven shifts in the prioritization of themes within language versions. Although identified clusters of tags align with the key themes in Russian propaganda, such as Ukraine, foreign affairs, Western countries, and the Middle East, we have observed significant differences in the attention given to specific issues across languages that are rather reactive to the information environment than representing a cohesive approach.

    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have emerged as an effective approach to tackling real-world problems. However, like human-written software, automatically-generated DNNs can have bugs and be attacked. This thus attracts many recent interests in developing effective and scalable DNN verification techniques and tools. In this work, we introduce a NeuralSAT, a new constraint solving approach to DNN verification. The design of NeuralSAT follows the DPLL(T) algorithm used modern SMT solving, which includes (conflict) clause learning, abstraction, and theory solving, and thus NeuralSAT can be considered as an SMT framework for DNNs. Preliminary results show that the NeuralSAT prototype is competitive to the state-of-the-art. We hope, with proper optimization and engineering, NeuralSAT will carry the power and success of modern SAT/SMT solvers to DNN verification.

    "abstract": "We consider the question of Gaussian mean testing, a fundamental task in high-dimensional distribution testing and signal processing, subject to adversarial corruptions of the samples. We focus on the relative power of different adversaries, and show that, in contrast to the common wisdom in robust statistics, there exists a strict separation between adaptive adversaries (strong contamination) and oblivious ones (weak contamination) for this task. Specifically, we resolve both the information-theoretic and computational landscapes for robust mean testing. In the exponential-time setting, we establish the tight sample complexity of testing $\\mathcal{N}(0,I)$ against $\\mathcal{N}(\\alpha v, I)$, where $\\|v\\|_2 = 1$, with an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of adversarial corruptions, to be \\[ \\tilde{\\Theta}\\!\\left(\\max\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\alpha^2}, \\frac{d\\varepsilon^3}{\\alpha^4},\\min\\left(\\frac{d^{2/3}\\varepsilon^{2/3}}{\\alpha^{8/3}}, \\frac{d \\varepsilon}{\\alpha^2}\\right)\\right) \\right) \\,, \\] while the complexity against adaptive adversaries is \\[ \\tilde{\\Theta}\\!\\left(\\max\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{\\alpha^2}, \\frac{d\\varepsilon^2}{\\alpha^4} \\right)\\right) \\,, \\] which is strictly worse for a large range of vanishing $\\varepsilon,\\alpha$. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first separation in sample complexity between the strong and weak contamination models. In the polynomial-time setting, we close a gap in the literature by providing a polynomial-time algorithm against adaptive adversaries achieving the above sample complexity $\\tilde{\\Theta}(\\max({\\sqrt{d}}/{\\alpha^2}, {d\\varepsilon^2}/{\\alpha^4} ))$, and a low-degree lower bound (which complements an existing reduction from planted clique) suggesting that all efficient algorithms require this many samples, even in the oblivious-adversary setting.

Researchers have begun exploring the implementation of LLMs as the driving core of social bots, enabling more efficient and user-friendly completion of tasks like profile completion, social behavior decision-making, and social content generation. However, there is currently a lack of systematic research on the behavioral characteristics of LLMs-driven social bots and their impact on social networks. We have curated data from Chirper, a Twitter-like social network populated by LLMs-driven social bots and embarked on an exploratory study. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs-driven social bots possess enhanced individual-level camouflage while exhibiting certain collective characteristics; (2) these bots have the ability to exert influence on online communities through toxic behaviors; (3) existing detection methods are applicable to the activity environment of LLMs-driven social bots but may be subject to certain limitations in effectiveness. Moreover, we have organized the data collected in our study into the Masquerade-23 dataset, which we have publicly released, thus addressing the data void in the subfield of LLMs-driven social bots behavior datasets. Our research outcomes provide primary insights for the research and governance of LLMs-driven social bots within the research community. ",

We propose both a preliminary, naive prompt and a novel prompting strategy for code detection. Results reveal that conventional prompting achieves great precision but poor accuracy (68.8%, 22.3%, and 79.2% for GEMM, convolution, and FFT, respectively) due to a high number of false positives. Our novel prompting strategy substantially reduces false positives, resulting in excellent overall accuracy (91.1%, 97.9%, and 99.7%, respectively).

    "abstract": "Learning-based methods for inverse problems, adapting to the data's inherent structure, have become ubiquitous in the last decade. Besides empirical investigations of their often remarkable performance, an increasing number of works addresses the issue of theoretical guarantees. Recently, [3] exploited invertible residual networks (iResNets) to learn provably convergent regularizations given reasonable assumptions. They enforced these guarantees by approximating the linear forward operator with an iResNet. Supervised training on relevant samples introduces data dependency into the approach. An open question in this context is to which extent the data's inherent structure influences the training outcome, i.e., the learned reconstruction scheme. Here we address this delicate interplay of training design and data dependency from a Bayesian perspective and shed light on opportunities and limitations. We resolve these limitations by analyzing reconstruction-based training of the inverses of iResNets, where we show that this optimization strategy introduces a level of data-dependency that cannot be achieved by approximation training. We further provide and discuss a series of numerical experiments underpinning and extending the theoretical findings. ",

To that end, we introduce AutoGNNUQ, an automated uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach for molecular property prediction. AutoGNNUQ leverages architecture search to generate an ensemble of high-performing GNNs, enabling the estimation of predictive uncertainties. Our approach employs variance decomposition to separate data (aleatoric) and model (epistemic) uncertainties, providing valuable insights for reducing them. In our computational experiments, we demonstrate that AutoGNNUQ outperforms existing UQ methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and UQ performance on multiple benchmark datasets. Additionally, we utilize t-SNE visualization to explore correlations between molecular features and uncertainty, offering insight for dataset improvement. AutoGNNUQ has broad applicability in domains such as drug discovery and materials science, where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial for decision-making. ",

This paper proposes a novel attention pattern to overcome this limitation, which integrates reasoning knowledge derived from a heterogeneous graph into the transformer architecture using a graph-enhanced self-attention mechanism. The proposed attention pattern comprises three key elements: global-local attention for word tokens, graph attention for entity tokens that exhibit strong attention towards tokens connected in the graph as opposed to those unconnected, and the consideration of the type of relationship between each entity token and word token. This results in optimized attention between the two if a relationship exists. The pattern is coupled with special relative position labels, allowing it to integrate with LUKE's entity-aware self-attention mechanism. The experimental findings corroborate that our model outperforms both the cutting-edge LUKE-Graph and the baseline LUKE model on the ReCoRD dataset that focuses on commonsense reasoning. ",

The key idea behind the method is to map a vector of hidden parameters of the network to a point that is guaranteed to be inside the feasible set defined by a set of constraints. The mapping is implemented by the additional neural network layer with constraints for output. The proposed method is simply extended to the case when constraints are imposed not only on the output vectors, but also on joint constraints depending on inputs. The projection approach to imposing constraints on outputs can simply be implemented in the framework of the proposed method. It is shown how to incorporate different types of constraints into the proposed method, including linear and quadratic constraints, equality constraints, and dynamic constraints, constraints in the form of boundaries. An important feature of the method is its computational simplicity. Complexities of the forward pass of the proposed neural network layer by linear and quadratic constraints are O(n*m) and O(n^2*m), respectively, where n is the number of variables, m is the number of constraints. Numerical experiments illustrate the method by solving optimization and classification problems. The code implementing the method is publicly available. ",

We propose the Dynamic Exploration Graph (DEG) which significantly outperforms existing algorithms in terms of search and exploration efficiency by combining two new ideas: First, a single undirected even regular graph is incrementally built by partially replacing existing edges to integrate new vertices and to update old neighborhoods at the same time. Secondly, an edge optimization algorithm is used to continuously improve the quality of the graph. Combining this ongoing refinement with the graph construction process leads to a well-organized graph structure at all times, resulting in: (1) increased search efficiency, (2) predictable index size, (3) guaranteed connectivity and therefore reachability of all vertices, and (4) a dynamic graph structure. In addition we investigate how well existing graph-based search systems can handle indexed queries where the seed vertex of a search is the query itself. Such exploration tasks, despite their good starting point, are not necessarily easy. High efficiency in approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) does not automatically imply good performance in exploratory search. Extensive experiments show that our new Dynamic Exploration Graph outperforms existing algorithms significantly for indexed and unindexed queries. ",

CSDs enjoy a graphical syntax similar to Lamport diagrams, and can be given compositional semantics in a variety of domains. We demonstrate the utility of CSDs by applying them to logical clocks -- widely-used mechanisms for reifying causal relationships as data -- yielding a generic proof of Lamport's clock condition that is parametric in a choice of clock. We instantiate this proof on Lamport's scalar clock, on Mattern's vector clock, and on the matrix clocks of Raynal et al. and of Wuu and Bernstein, yielding verified implementations of each.

However, it was also discovered that DNNs are vulnerable to multiple kinds of attacks, including Backdoor Attacks. Through the attack, the attacker manages to embed a hidden backdoor into the DNN such that the model behaves normally on benign data samples, but makes attacker-specified judgments given the occurrence of a predefined trigger. Although numerous backdoor attacks have been experimented on image classification, backdoor attacks on object detection tasks have not been properly investigated and explored. As object detection has been adopted as an important module in multiple security-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving, backdoor attacks on object detection could pose even more severe threats. Inspired by the inherent property of deep learning-based object detectors, we propose a simple yet effective backdoor attack method against object detection without modifying the ground truth annotations, specifically focusing on the object disappearance attack and object generation attack. Extensive experiments and ablation studies prove the effectiveness of our attack on two benchmark object detection datasets, PASCAL VOC07+12 and MSCOCO, on which we achieve an attack success rate of more than 92% with a poison rate of only 5%.

    "abstract": "Traditionally, sparse retrieval systems relied on lexical representations to retrieve documents, such as BM25, dominated information retrieval tasks. With the onset of pre-trained transformer models such as BERT, neural sparse retrieval has led to a new paradigm within retrieval. Despite the success, there has been limited software supporting different sparse retrievers running in a unified, common environment. This hinders practitioners from fairly comparing different sparse models and obtaining realistic evaluation results. Another missing piece is, that a majority of prior work evaluates sparse retrieval models on in-domain retrieval, i.e. on a single dataset: MS MARCO. However, a key requirement in practical retrieval systems requires models that can generalize well to unseen out-of-domain, i.e. zero-shot retrieval tasks. In this work, we provide SPRINT, a unified Python toolkit based on Pyserini and Lucene, supporting a common interface for evaluating neural sparse retrieval. The toolkit currently includes five built-in models: uniCOIL, DeepImpact, SPARTA, TILDEv2 and SPLADEv2. Users can also easily add customized models by defining their term weighting method. Using our toolkit, we establish strong and reproducible zero-shot sparse retrieval baselines across the well-acknowledged benchmark, BEIR. Our results demonstrate that SPLADEv2 achieves the best average score of 0.470 nDCG@10 on BEIR amongst all neural sparse retrievers. In this work, we further uncover the reasons behind its performance gain. We show that SPLADEv2 produces sparse representations with a majority of tokens outside of the original query and document which is often crucial for its performance gains, i.e. a limitation among its other sparse counterparts.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of the learning approach, we coupled it with various regression methods that employ gradient-based optimizers for training.

In this work, we propose a novel Part Semantic Network (PSN) to solve this problem. The core of PSN is a Conditional Part Attention (CPA) mechanism, where human features are taken as keys and values, and the object feature is used as query for the computation in a cross-attention mechanism. In this way, our model learns to automatically focus on the most informative human parts conditioned on the involved object, generating more semantically meaningful features for interaction recognition. Additionally, we propose an Occluded Part Extrapolation (OPE) strategy to facilitate interaction recognition under occluded scenarios, which teaches the model to extrapolate detailed features from partially occluded ones. Our method consistently outperforms prior approaches on the V-COCO and HICO-DET datasets, without external data or extra annotations.

    "abstract": "With rapid development and deployment of generative language models in global settings, there is an urgent need to also scale our measurements of harm, not just in the number and types of harms covered, but also how well they account for local cultural contexts, including marginalized identities and the social biases experienced by them. Current evaluation paradigms are limited in their abilities to address this, as they are not representative of diverse, locally situated but global, socio-cultural perspectives. It is imperative that our evaluation resources are enhanced and calibrated by including people and experiences from different cultures and societies worldwide, in order to prevent gross underestimations or skews in measurements of harm. In this work, we demonstrate a socio-culturally aware expansion of evaluation resources in the Indian societal context, specifically for the harm of stereotyping. We devise a community engaged effort to build a resource which contains stereotypes for axes of disparity that are uniquely present in India. The resultant resource increases the number of stereotypes known for and in the Indian context by over 1000 stereotypes across many unique identities. We also demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of such expanded resources for evaluations of language models. CONTENT WARNING: This paper contains examples of stereotypes that may be offensive. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach called the boundary integrated neural networks (BINNs) for analyzing acoustic radiation and scattering. The method introduces fundamental solutions of the time-harmonic wave equation to encode the boundary integral equations (BIEs) within the neural networks, replacing the conventional use of the governing equation in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). This approach offers several advantages. Firstly, the input data for the neural networks in the BINNs only require the coordinates of \"boundary\" collocation points, making it highly suitable for analyzing acoustic fields in unbounded domains. Secondly, the loss function of the BINNs is not a composite form, and has a fast convergence. Thirdly, the BINNs achieve comparable precision to the PINNs using fewer collocation points and hidden layers/neurons. Finally, the semi-analytic characteristic of the BIEs contributes to the higher precision of the BINNs. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. ",

Stress-graph embeddings are weighted versions of Tutte embeddings, where solving a linear system places vertices at a minimum-energy configuration for a system of springs. A major drawback of the unweighted Tutte embedding is that it often results in drawings with exponential area. We present a number of approaches for choosing better weights. One approach constructs weights (in linear time) that uniformly spread all vertices in a chosen direction, such as parallel to the $x$- or $y$-axis. A second approach morphs $x$- and $y$-spread drawings to produce a more aesthetically pleasing and uncluttered drawing. We further explore a \"kaleidoscope\" paradigm for this $xy$-morph approach, where we rotate the coordinate axes so as to find the best spreads and morphs. A third approach chooses the weight of each edge according to its depth in a spanning tree rooted at the outer vertices, such as a Schnyder wood or BFS tree, in order to pull vertices closer to the boundary.

Although significant progress has been made, there are still two major challenges that need to be addressed. Firstly, the layout of existing datasets is relatively fixed and limited in the number of semantic entity categories, creating a significant gap between these datasets and the complex real-world scenarios. Secondly, existing methods follow a two-stage pipeline strategy, which may lead to the error propagation problem. Additionally, they are difficult to apply in situations where unseen semantic entity categories emerge. To address the first challenge, we propose a new large-scale human-annotated dataset named Complex Layout form for key information EXtraction (CLEX), which consists of 5,860 images with 1,162 semantic entity categories. To solve the second challenge, we introduce Parallel Pointer-based Network (PPN), an end-to-end model that can be applied in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. PPN leverages the implicit clues between semantic entities to assist extracting, and its parallel extraction mechanism allows it to extract multiple results simultaneously and efficiently. Experiments on the CLEX dataset demonstrate that PPN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods while also offering a much faster inference speed. ",

Motivated by this practical challenge, we develop a lightweight neural path planning architecture with a dual input network and a hybrid sampler for resource-constrained robotic systems. Our architecture is designed with efficient task feature extraction and fusion modules to translate the given planning instance into a guidance map. The hybrid sampler is then applied to restrict the planning within the prospective regions indicated by the guide map. To enable the network training, we further construct a publicly available dataset with various successful planning instances. Numerical simulations and physical experiments demonstrate that, compared with baseline approaches, our approach has nearly an order of magnitude fewer model size and five times lower computational while achieving promising performance. Besides, our approach can also accelerate the planning convergence process with fewer planning iterations compared to sample-based methods. ",

    "abstract": "Air traffic control (ATC) is a safety-critical service system that demands constant attention from ground air traffic controllers (ATCos) to maintain daily aviation operations. The workload of the ATCos can have negative effects on operational safety and airspace usage. To avoid overloading and ensure an acceptable workload level for the ATCos, it is important to predict the ATCos' workload accurately for mitigation actions. In this paper, we first perform a review of research on ATCo workload, mostly from the air traffic perspective. Then, we briefly introduce the setup of the human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with retired ATCos, where the air traffic data and workload labels are obtained. The simulations are conducted under three Phoenix approach scenarios while the human ATCos are requested to self-evaluate their workload ratings (i.e., low-1 to high-7). Preliminary data analysis is conducted. Next, we propose a graph-based deep-learning framework with conformal prediction to identify the ATCo workload levels. The number of aircraft under the controller's control varies both spatially and temporally, resulting in dynamically evolving graphs. The experiment results suggest that (a) besides the traffic density feature, the traffic conflict feature contributes to the workload prediction capabilities (i.e., minimum horizontal/vertical separation distance); (b) directly learning from the spatiotemporal graph layout of airspace with graph neural network can achieve higher prediction accuracy, compare to hand-crafted traffic complexity features; (c) conformal prediction is a valuable tool to further boost model prediction accuracy, resulting a range of predicted workload labels.

In this paper, we explore the task of purifying a backdoored model using a small clean dataset. By establishing the connection between backdoor risk and adversarial risk, we derive a novel upper bound for backdoor risk, which mainly captures the risk on the shared adversarial examples (SAEs) between the backdoored model and the purified model. This upper bound further suggests a novel bi-level optimization problem for mitigating backdoor using adversarial training techniques. To solve it, we propose Shared Adversarial Unlearning (SAU). Specifically, SAU first generates SAEs, and then, unlearns the generated SAEs such that they are either correctly classified by the purified model and/or differently classified by the two models, such that the backdoor effect in the backdoored model will be mitigated in the purified model. Experiments on various benchmark datasets and network architectures show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance for backdoor defense. ",

In this paper, we propose a no-frills TVG model that consists of two core modules, namely multi-scale neighboring attention and zoom-in boundary detection. The multi-scale neighboring attention restricts each video token to only aggregate visual contexts from its neighbor, enabling the extraction of the most distinguishing information with multi-scale feature hierarchies from high-ratio noises. The zoom-in boundary detection then focuses on local-wise discrimination of the selected top candidates for fine-grained grounding adjustment. With an end-to-end training strategy, our model achieves competitive performance on different TVG benchmarks, while also having the advantage of faster inference speed and lighter model parameters, thanks to its lightweight architecture.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, botnets have become one of the major threats to cyber security. The characteristics of botnets are mainly reflected in bots network behavior and their intercommunication relationships. Existing botnet detection methods use flow features or topological features of the communication graph individually and overlook the other type of feature, which affects model performance. In this paper, we propose a botnet detection model which uses graph convolutional network (GCN) to deeply fuse flow features and topological features for the first time. We construct communication graphs from network traffic and represent nodes with flow features. Due to the imbalance of existing public traffic flow datasets, it is impossible to train a GCN model on these datasets. Therefore, we use a balanced public communication graph dataset to pretrain a GCN model, thereby guaranteeing its capacity for recognizing topological features. We then feed the communication graph with flow features into the pretrained GCN. The output from the last hidden layer is treated as the fusion of flow and topological features. Additionally, by adjusting the number of layers in the GCN network, the model can effectively detect botnets operating under both C2 and P2P structures. Validated on the public ISCX2014 dataset, our approach achieves a remarkable accuracy of 98.85% and a recall rate of 92.90% for C2 botnets, alongside an accuracy of 99.10% and a recall rate of 94.66% for P2P botnets. These results not only demonstrate the efficacy of our method, but also surpass the performance of the currently leading detection models. ",

    "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates more than billions of intelligent devices over the globe with the capability of communicating with other connected devices with little to no human intervention. IoT enables data aggregation and analysis on a large scale to improve life quality in many domains. In particular, data collected by IoT contain a tremendous amount of information for anomaly detection. The heterogeneous nature of IoT is both a challenge and an opportunity for cybersecurity. Traditional approaches in cybersecurity monitoring often require different kinds of data pre-processing and handling for various data types, which might be problematic for datasets that contain heterogeneous features. However, heterogeneous types of network devices can often capture a more diverse set of signals than a single type of device readings, which is particularly useful for anomaly detection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on using ensemble machine learning methods for enhancing IoT cybersecurity via anomaly detection. Rather than using one single machine learning model, ensemble learning combines the predictive power from multiple models, enhancing their predictive accuracy in heterogeneous datasets rather than using one single machine learning model. We propose a unified framework with ensemble learning that utilises Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation to adapt to a network environment that contains multiple IoT sensor readings. Experimentally, we illustrate their high predictive power when compared to traditional methods. ",

This introduces novel strengths (different methods may work well for different problems) and weaknesses (it may be difficult for users to know which method to use). In this paper, we introduce Multi-Method Self-Training (MMST), where one method is trained on the filtered outputs of another, allowing us to augment the strengths and ameliorate the weaknesses of each method. Using a 176B parameter model trained on both language and code, we show that MMST can 1) improve the less performant method (up to 30%) making the model easier to use, 2) improve the more performant method (up to 32.2%) making the model more performant, and 3) improve the performance of related but distinct tasks (up to 10.3%) by improving the ability of the model to generate rationales. We then conduct ablation analyses to explore why MMST works. We show that MMST generates more data than traditional self-training, but the improvement in performance is driven by the use of multiple methods. We also analyze prompt-engineering and anti-correlated performance between methods as means of making MMST more effective. We hope the evidence from our paper motivates machine learning researchers to explore ways in which advances in language models allow for new forms of training. ",

    "abstract": "In today's era of information explosion, more users are becoming more reliant upon recommender systems to have better advice, suggestions, or inspire them. The measure of the semantic relatedness or likeness between terms, words, or text data plays an important role in different applications dealing with textual data, as in a recommender system. Over the past few years, many ontologies have been developed and used as a form of structured representation of knowledge bases for information systems. The measure of semantic similarity from ontology has developed by several methods. In this paper, we propose and carry on an approach for the improvement of semantic similarity calculations within a recommender system based-on RDF graphs. ",

    "abstract": "The widespread use of face retouching filters on short-video platforms has raised concerns about the authenticity of digital appearances and the impact of deceptive advertising. To address these issues, there is a pressing need to develop advanced face retouching techniques. However, the lack of large-scale and fine-grained face retouching datasets has been a major obstacle to progress in this field. In this paper, we introduce RetouchingFFHQ, a large-scale and fine-grained face retouching dataset that contains over half a million conditionally-retouched images. RetouchingFFHQ stands out from previous datasets due to its large scale, high quality, fine-grainedness, and customization. By including four typical types of face retouching operations and different retouching levels, we extend the binary face retouching detection into a fine-grained, multi-retouching type, and multi-retouching level estimation problem. Additionally, we propose a Multi-granularity Attention Module (MAM) as a plugin for CNN backbones for enhanced cross-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments using different baselines as well as our proposed method on RetouchingFFHQ show decent performance on face retouching detection. With the proposed new dataset, we believe there is great potential for future work to tackle the challenging problem of real-world fine-grained face retouching detection. ",

    "abstract": "With the emergence of new application areas, such as cyber-physical systems and human-in-the-loop applications, there is a need to guarantee a certain level of end-to-end network latency with extremely high reliability, e.g., 99.999%. While mechanisms specified under IEEE 802.1as time-sensitive networking (TSN) can be used to achieve these requirements for switched Ethernet networks, implementing TSN mechanisms in wireless networks is challenging due to their stochastic nature. To conform the wireless link to a reliability level of 99.999%, the behavior of extremely rare outliers in the latency probability distribution, or the tail of the distribution, must be analyzed and controlled. This work proposes predicting the tail of the latency distribution using state-of-the-art data-driven approaches, such as mixture density networks (MDN) and extreme value mixture models, to estimate the likelihood of rare latencies conditioned on the network parameters, which can be used to make more informed decisions in wireless transmission. Actual latency measurements of IEEE 802.11g (WiFi), commercial private and a software-defined 5G network are used to benchmark the proposed approaches and evaluate their sensitivities concerning the tail probabilities.

The framework introduces three optimization targets: prediction score, shape score, and sensitivity score, which can be easily adapted to different model backbones without prior knowledge or manual labeling efforts. The proposed framework has been successfully applied online for over six months, serving more than 50,000 time series every minute. It simplifies the user's experience by requiring only an expected sensitive value, offering a user-friendly interface, and achieving desired detection results. Extensive evaluations conducted on public datasets and comparison with other methods further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a highly effective paradigm for privacy-preserving collaborative training among different parties. Unlike traditional centralized learning, which requires collecting data from each party, FL allows clients to share privacy-preserving information without exposing private datasets. This approach not only guarantees enhanced privacy protection but also facilitates more efficient and secure collaboration among multiple participants. Therefore, FL has gained considerable attention from researchers, promoting numerous surveys to summarize the related works. However, the majority of these surveys concentrate on methods sharing model parameters during the training process, while overlooking the potential of sharing other forms of local information. In this paper, we present a systematic survey from a new perspective, i.e., what to share in FL, with an emphasis on the model utility, privacy leakage, and communication efficiency. This survey differs from previous ones due to four distinct contributions. First, we present a new taxonomy of FL methods in terms of the sharing methods, which includes three categories of shared information: model sharing, synthetic data sharing, and knowledge sharing. Second, we analyze the vulnerability of different sharing methods to privacy attacks and review the defense mechanisms that provide certain privacy guarantees. Third, we conduct extensive experiments to compare the performance and communication overhead of various sharing methods in FL. Besides, we assess the potential privacy leakage through model inversion and membership inference attacks, while comparing the effectiveness of various defense approaches. Finally, we discuss potential deficiencies in current methods and outline future directions for improvement. ",

Therefore, we studied this impact for several commonly occurring tasks related to MLN analysis. Additionally, layer arrangements with a dimensionality beyond 2D, which are common in this scenario, motivate the use of stereoscopic displays. We ran a human subject study utilising a Virtual Reality headset to evaluate 2D, 2.5D, and 3D layer arrangements. The study employs six analysis tasks that cover the spectrum of an MLN task taxonomy, from path finding and pattern identification to comparisons between and across layers. We found no clear overall winner. However, we explore the task-to-arrangement space and derive empirical-based recommendations on the effective use of 2D, 2.5D, and 3D layer arrangements for MLNs. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel ``pre-train, adapt and detect\" paradigm to detect camouflaged objects. By introducing a large pre-trained model, abundant knowledge learned from massive multi-modal data can be directly transferred to COD. A lightweight parallel adapter is inserted to adjust the features suitable for the downstream COD task. Extensive experiments on four challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art COD models by large margins. Moreover, we design a multi-task learning scheme for tuning the adapter to exploit the shareable knowledge across different semantic classes. Comprehensive experimental results showed that the generalization ability of our model can be substantially improved with multi-task adapter initialization on source tasks and multi-task adaptation on target tasks.

To improve the feasibility of denoising procedures, in this study, we proposed a single-image self-supervised learning method in which only the noisy input image is used for network training. Gated convolution was used for feature extraction and no-reference image quality assessment was used for guiding the training process. Moreover, the proposed method sampled instances from the input image dataset using Bernoulli sampling with a certain dropout rate for training. The corresponding result was produced by averaging the generated predictions from various instances of the trained network with dropouts. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art denoising performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. This highlights the effectiveness and practicality of our method as a potential solution for various noise removal tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Recommending suitable jobs to users is a critical task in online recruitment platforms, as it can enhance users' satisfaction and the platforms' profitability. While existing job recommendation methods encounter challenges such as the low quality of users' resumes, which hampers their accuracy and practical effectiveness. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), utilizing the rich external knowledge encapsulated within them, as well as their powerful capabilities of text processing and reasoning, is a promising way to complete users' resumes for more accurate recommendations. However, directly leveraging LLMs to enhance recommendation results is not a one-size-fits-all solution, as LLMs may suffer from fabricated generation and few-shot problems, which degrade the quality of resume completion. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-based approach for job recommendation. To alleviate the limitation of fabricated generation for LLMs, we extract accurate and valuable information beyond users' self-description, which helps the LLMs better profile users for resume completion. Specifically, we not only extract users' explicit properties (e.g., skills, interests) from their self-description but also infer users' implicit characteristics from their behaviors for more accurate and meaningful resume completion. Nevertheless, some users still suffer from few-shot problems, which arise due to scarce interaction records, leading to limited guidance for the models in generating high-quality resumes. To address this issue, we propose aligning unpaired low-quality with high-quality generated resumes by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which can refine the resume representations for better recommendation results. Extensive experiments on three large real-world recruitment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. ",

To construct urban-level radiance fields efficiently, we design Deformable Neural Mesh Primitive~(DNMP), and propose to parameterize the entire scene with such primitives. The DNMP is a flexible and compact neural variant of classic mesh representation, which enjoys both the efficiency of rasterization-based rendering and the powerful neural representation capability for photo-realistic image synthesis. Specifically, a DNMP consists of a set of connected deformable mesh vertices with paired vertex features to parameterize the geometry and radiance information of a local area. To constrain the degree of freedom for optimization and lower the storage budgets, we enforce the shape of each primitive to be decoded from a relatively low-dimensional latent space. The rendering colors are decoded from the vertex features (interpolated with rasterization) by a view-dependent MLP. The DNMP provides a new paradigm for urban-level scene representation with appealing properties: $(1)$ High-quality rendering. Our method achieves leading performance for novel view synthesis in urban scenarios. $(2)$ Low computational costs. Our representation enables fast rendering (2.07ms/1k pixels) and low peak memory usage (110MB/1k pixels). We also present a lightweight version that can run 33$\\times$ faster than vanilla NeRFs, and comparable to the highly-optimized Instant-NGP (0.61 vs 0.71ms/1k pixels).

However, the adoption of this technology has been hindered by sparsity and noise issues in radar point cloud data. This paper introduces spatial multi-representation fusion (SMURF), a novel approach to 3D object detection using a single 4D imaging radar. SMURF leverages multiple representations of radar detection points, including pillarization and density features of a multi-dimensional Gaussian mixture distribution through kernel density estimation (KDE). KDE effectively mitigates measurement inaccuracy caused by limited angular resolution and multi-path propagation of radar signals. Additionally, KDE helps alleviate point cloud sparsity by capturing density features. Experimental evaluations on View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of SMURF, outperforming recently proposed 4D imaging radar-based single-representation models. Moreover, while using 4D imaging radar only, SMURF still achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art 4D imaging radar and camera fusion-based method, with an increase of 1.22% in the mean average precision on bird's-eye view of TJ4DRadSet dataset and 1.32% in the 3D mean average precision on the entire annotated area of VoD dataset. Our proposed method demonstrates impressive inference time and addresses the challenges of real-time detection, with the inference time no more than 0.05 seconds for most scans on both datasets. This research highlights the benefits of 4D mmWave radar and is a strong benchmark for subsequent works regarding 3D object detection with 4D imaging radar. ",

While newly proposed few-shot AD methods do compare against pre-existing algorithms developed for the full-shot domain as baselines, they do not dedicatedly optimize them for the few-shot setting. It thus remains unclear if the performance of such pre-existing algorithms can be further improved. We address said question in this work. Specifically, we present a study on the AD/anomaly segmentation (AS) performance of PatchCore, the current state-of-the-art full-shot AD/AS algorithm, in both the few-shot and the many-shot settings. We hypothesize that further performance improvements can be realized by (I) optimizing its various hyperparameters, and by (II) transferring techniques known to improve few-shot supervised learning to the AD domain. Exhaustive experiments on the public VisA and MVTec AD datasets reveal that (I) significant performance improvements can be realized by optimizing hyperparameters such as the underlying feature extractor, and that (II) image-level augmentations can, but are not guaranteed, to improve performance. Based on these findings, we achieve a new state of the art in few-shot AD on VisA, further demonstrating the merit of adapting pre-existing AD/AS methods to the few-shot setting. Last, we identify the investigation of feature extractors with a strong inductive bias as a potential future research direction for (few-shot) AD/AS. ",

    "abstract": "Despite successes across a broad range of applications, sequence-to-sequence models' construct of solutions are argued to be less compositional than human-like generalization. There is mounting evidence that one of the reasons hindering compositional generalization is representations of the encoder and decoder uppermost layer are entangled. In other words, the syntactic and semantic representations of sequences are twisted inappropriately. However, most previous studies mainly concentrate on enhancing token-level semantic information to alleviate the representations entanglement problem, rather than composing and using the syntactic and semantic representations of sequences appropriately as humans do. In addition, we explain why the entanglement problem exists from the perspective of recent studies about training deeper Transformer, mainly owing to the ``shallow'' residual connections and its simple, one-step operations, which fails to fuse previous layers' information effectively. Starting from this finding and inspired by humans' strategies, we propose \\textsc{FuSion} (\\textbf{Fu}sing \\textbf{S}yntactic and Semant\\textbf{i}c Representati\\textbf{on}s), an extension to sequence-to-sequence models to learn to fuse previous layers' information back into the encoding and decoding process appropriately through introducing a \\emph{fuse-attention module} at each encoder and decoder layer. \\textsc{FuSion} achieves competitive and even \\textbf{state-of-the-art} results on two realistic benchmarks, which empirically demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal.

    "abstract": "With the increasing amount of spatial-temporal~(ST) ocean data, numerous spatial-temporal data mining (STDM) studies have been conducted to address various oceanic issues, e.g., climate forecasting and disaster warning. Compared with typical ST data (e.g., traffic data), ST ocean data is more complicated with some unique characteristics, e.g., diverse regionality and high sparsity. These characteristics make it difficult to design and train STDM models. Unfortunately, an overview of these studies is still missing, hindering computer scientists to identify the research issues in ocean while discouraging researchers in ocean science from applying advanced STDM techniques. To remedy this situation, we provide a comprehensive survey to summarize existing STDM studies in ocean. Concretely, we first summarize the widely-used ST ocean datasets and identify their unique characteristics. Then, typical ST ocean data quality enhancement techniques are discussed. Next, we classify existing STDM studies for ocean into four types of tasks, i.e., prediction, event detection, pattern mining, and anomaly detection, and elaborate the techniques for these tasks. Finally, promising research opportunities are highlighted. This survey will help scientists from the fields of both computer science and ocean science have a better understanding of the fundamental concepts, key techniques, and open challenges of STDM in ocean.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a deep learning architecture for nowcasting of precipitation almost globally every 30 min with a 4-hour lead time. The architecture fuses a U-Net and a convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network and is trained using data from the Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) and a few key precipitation drivers from the Global Forecast System (GFS). The impacts of different training loss functions, including the mean-squared error (regression) and the focal-loss (classification), on the quality of precipitation nowcasts are studied. The results indicate that the regression network performs well in capturing light precipitation (below 1.6 mm/hr), but the classification network can outperform the regression network for nowcasting of precipitation extremes (>8 mm/hr), in terms of the critical success index (CSI).. Using the Wasserstein distance, it is shown that the predicted precipitation by the classification network has a closer class probability distribution to the IMERG than the regression network. It is uncovered that the inclusion of the physical variables can improve precipitation nowcasting, especially at longer lead times in both networks. Taking IMERG as a relative reference, a multi-scale analysis in terms of fractions skill score (FSS), shows that the nowcasting machine remains skillful (FSS > 0.5) at the resolution of 10 km compared to 50 km for GFS. For precipitation rates greater than 4~mm/hr, only the classification network remains FSS-skillful on scales greater than 50 km within a 2-hour lead time. ",

    "abstract": "Weakly-supervised change detection (WSCD) aims to detect pixel-level changes with only image-level annotations. Owing to its label efficiency, WSCD is drawing increasing attention recently. However, current WSCD methods often encounter the challenge of change missing and fabricating, i.e., the inconsistency between image-level annotations and pixel-level predictions. Specifically, change missing refer to the situation that the WSCD model fails to predict any changed pixels, even though the image-level label indicates changed, and vice versa for change fabricating. To address this challenge, in this work, we leverage global-scale and local-scale priors in WSCD and propose two components: a Dilated Prior (DP) decoder and a Label Gated (LG) constraint. The DP decoder decodes samples with the changed image-level label, skips samples with the unchanged label, and replaces them with an all-unchanged pixel-level label. The LG constraint is derived from the correspondence between changed representations and image-level labels, penalizing the model when it mispredicts the change status. Additionally, we develop TransWCD, a simple yet powerful transformer-based model, showcasing the potential of weakly-supervised learning in change detection. By integrating the DP decoder and LG constraint into TransWCD, we form TransWCD-DL. Our proposed TransWCD and TransWCD-DL achieve significant +6.33% and +9.55% F1 score improvements over the state-of-the-art methods on the WHU-CD dataset, respectively. Some performance metrics even exceed several fully-supervised change detection (FSCD) competitors. Code will be available at https://github.com/zhenghuizhao/TransWCD. ",

In this work, however, we find both theoretically and empirically that the variance of network weights and spatial concentration of large weights are the main factors that impact neural persistence. Whilst this captures useful information for linear classifiers, we find that no relevant spatial structure is present in later layers of deep neural networks, making neural persistence roughly equivalent to the variance of weights. Additionally, the proposed averaging procedure across layers for deep neural networks does not consider interaction between layers. Based on our analysis, we propose an extension of the filtration underlying neural persistence to the whole neural network instead of single layers, which is equivalent to calculating neural persistence on one particular matrix. This yields our deep graph persistence measure, which implicitly incorporates persistent paths through the network and alleviates variance-related issues through standardisation.

    "abstract": "Performance issues permeate large-scale cloud service systems, which can lead to huge revenue losses. To ensure reliable performance, it's essential to accurately identify and localize these issues using service monitoring metrics. Given the complexity and scale of modern cloud systems, this task can be challenging and may require extensive expertise and resources beyond the capacity of individual humans. Some existing methods tackle this problem by analyzing each metric independently to detect anomalies. However, this could incur overwhelming alert storms that are difficult for engineers to diagnose manually. To pursue better performance, not only the temporal patterns of metrics but also the correlation between metrics (i.e., relational patterns) should be considered, which can be formulated as a multivariate metrics anomaly detection problem. However, most of the studies fall short of extracting these two types of features explicitly. Moreover, there exist some unlabeled anomalies mixed in the training data, which may hinder the detection performance. To address these limitations, we propose the Relational- Temporal Anomaly Detection Model (RTAnomaly) that combines the relational and temporal information of metrics. RTAnomaly employs a graph attention layer to learn the dependencies among metrics, which will further help pinpoint the anomalous metrics that may cause the anomaly effectively. In addition, we exploit the concept of positive unlabeled learning to address the issue of potential anomalies in the training data. To evaluate our method, we conduct experiments on a public dataset and two industrial datasets. RTAnomaly outperforms all the baseline models by achieving an average F1 score of 0.929 and Hit@3 of 0.920, demonstrating its superiority. ",

    "abstract": "The popularity of point cloud deep models for safety-critical purposes has increased, but the reliability and security of these models can be compromised by intentional or naturally occurring point cloud noise. To combat this issue, we present a novel point cloud outlier removal method called PointCVaR, which empowers standard-trained models to eliminate additional outliers and restore the data. Our approach begins by conducting attribution analysis to determine the influence of each point on the model output, which we refer to as point risk. We then optimize the process of filtering high-risk points using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as the objective. The rationale for this approach is based on the observation that noise points in point clouds tend to cluster in the tail of the risk distribution, with a low frequency but a high level of risk, resulting in significant interference with classification results. Despite requiring no additional training effort, our method produces exceptional results in various removal-and-classification experiments for noisy point clouds, which are corrupted by random noise, adversarial noise, and backdoor trigger noise. Impressively, it achieves 87% accuracy in defense against the backdoor attack by removing triggers. Overall, the proposed PointCVaR effectively eliminates noise points and enhances point cloud classification, making it a promising plug-in module for various models in different scenarios. ",

In this work, we provide a more flexible framework where a neuron can be replaced with a linear combination of other neurons, improving the reduction. We apply this approach both on syntactic and semantic abstractions, and implement and evaluate them experimentally.

We consider a different lower bound on the MI consisting of an entropy and a reconstruction term (ER), and analyze the main MVSSL families through its lens. Through this ER bound, we show that clustering-based methods such as DeepCluster and SwAV maximize the MI. We also re-interpret the mechanisms of distillation-based approaches such as BYOL and DINO, showing that they explicitly maximize the reconstruction term and implicitly encourage a stable entropy, and we confirm this empirically.

However, it remains unclear whether this approach is truly optimal for effectively utilizing the pre-trained knowledge, especially considering the diverse categories of SSL that capture different types of features. In this paper, we first establish strong contrastive and restorative SSL baselines that outperform SOTA methods across four diverse downstream tasks. Building upon these strong baselines, we conduct an extensive fine-tuning analysis across multiple pre-training and fine-tuning datasets, as well as various fine-tuning dataset sizes. Contrary to the conventional wisdom of fine-tuning only the last few layers of a pre-trained network, we show that fine-tuning intermediate layers is more effective, with fine-tuning the second quarter (25-50%) of the network being optimal for contrastive SSL whereas fine-tuning the third quarter (50-75%) of the network being optimal for restorative SSL. Compared to the de-facto standard of end-to-end fine-tuning, our best fine-tuning strategy, which fine-tunes a shallower network consisting of the first three quarters (0-75%) of the pre-trained network, yields improvements of as much as 5.48%. Additionally, using these insights, we propose a simple yet effective method to leverage the complementary strengths of multiple SSL models, resulting in enhancements of up to 3.57% compared to using the best model alone. Hence, our fine-tuning strategies not only enhance the performance of individual SSL models, but also enable effective utilization of the complementary strengths offered by multiple SSL models, leading to significant improvements in self-supervised medical imaging analysis.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) for clinical time series data has received significant attention in recent literature, since these data are highly rich and provide important information about a patient's physiological state. However, most existing SSL methods for clinical time series are limited in that they are designed for unimodal time series, such as a sequence of structured features (e.g., lab values and vitals signs) or an individual high-dimensional physiological signal (e.g., an electrocardiogram). These existing methods cannot be readily extended to model time series that exhibit multimodality, with structured features and high-dimensional data being recorded at each timestep in the sequence. In this work, we address this gap and propose a new SSL method -- Sequential Multi-Dimensional SSL -- where a SSL loss is applied both at the level of the entire sequence and at the level of the individual high-dimensional data points in the sequence in order to better capture information at both scales. Our strategy is agnostic to the specific form of loss function used at each level -- it can be contrastive, as in SimCLR, or non-contrastive, as in VICReg. We evaluate our method on two real-world clinical datasets, where the time series contains sequences of (1) high-frequency electrocardiograms and (2) structured data from lab values and vitals signs. Our experimental results indicate that pre-training with our method and then fine-tuning on downstream tasks improves performance over baselines on both datasets, and in several settings, can lead to improvements across different self-supervised loss functions.

The extensive ablations show that our method can achieve significant performance improvements by using the outputs of existing 3D object detection methods. Since our method uses the detection outputs rather than detection method intermediate representations, a single model of our method can use any detection method at test time. ",

    "abstract": "Current object detection models have achieved good results on many benchmark datasets, detecting objects in dark conditions remains a large challenge. To address this issue, we propose a pyramid enhanced network (PENet) and joint it with YOLOv3 to build a dark object detection framework named PE-YOLO. Firstly, PENet decomposes the image into four components of different resolutions using the Laplacian pyramid. Specifically we propose a detail processing module (DPM) to enhance the detail of images, which consists of context branch and edge branch. In addition, we propose a low-frequency enhancement filter (LEF) to capture low-frequency semantics and prevent high-frequency noise. PE-YOLO adopts an end-to-end joint training approach and only uses normal detection loss to simplify the training process. We conduct experiments on the low-light object detection dataset ExDark to demonstrate the effectiveness of ours. The results indicate that compared with other dark detectors and low-light enhancement models, PE-YOLO achieves the advanced results, achieving 78.0% in mAP and 53.6 in FPS, respectively, which can adapt to object detection under different low-light conditions.

    "abstract": "The Cyber threats exposure has created worldwide pressure on organizations to comply with cyber security standards and policies for protecting their digital assets. Vulnerability assessment (VA) and Penetration Testing (PT) are widely adopted Security Compliance (SC) methods to identify security gaps and anticipate security breaches. In the computer networks context and despite the use of autonomous tools and systems, security compliance remains highly repetitive and resources consuming. In this paper, we proposed a novel method to tackle the ever-growing problem of efficiency and effectiveness in network infrastructures security auditing by formally introducing, designing, and developing an Expert-System Automated Security Compliance Framework (ESASCF) that enables industrial and open-source VA and PT tools and systems to extract, process, store and re-use the expertise in a human-expert way to allow direct application in similar scenarios or during the periodic re-testing. The implemented model was then integrated within the ESASCF and tested on different size networks and proved efficient in terms of time-efficiency and testing effectiveness allowing ESASCF to take over autonomously the SC in Re-testing and offloading Expert by automating repeated segments SC and thus enabling Experts to prioritize important tasks in Ad-Hoc compliance tests. The obtained results validate the performance enhancement notably by cutting the time required for an expert to 50% in the context of typical corporate networks first SC and 20% in re-testing, representing a significant cost-cutting. In addition, the framework allows a long-term impact illustrated in the knowledge extraction, generalization, and re-utilization, which enables better SC confidence independent of the human expert skills, coverage, and wrong decisions resulting in impactful false negatives.

    "abstract": "Collaborative inference has been a promising solution to enable resource-constrained edge devices to perform inference using state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs). In collaborative inference, the edge device first feeds the input to a partial DNN locally and then uploads the intermediate result to the cloud to complete the inference. However, recent research indicates model inversion attacks (MIAs) can reconstruct input data from intermediate results, posing serious privacy concerns for collaborative inference. Existing perturbation and cryptography techniques are inefficient and unreliable in defending against MIAs while performing accurate inference. This paper provides a viable solution, named PATROL, which develops privacy-oriented pruning to balance privacy, efficiency, and utility of collaborative inference. PATROL takes advantage of the fact that later layers in a DNN can extract more task-specific features. Given limited local resources for collaborative inference, PATROL intends to deploy more layers at the edge based on pruning techniques to enforce task-specific features for inference and reduce task-irrelevant but sensitive features for privacy preservation. To achieve privacy-oriented pruning, PATROL introduces two key components: Lipschitz regularization and adversarial reconstruction training, which increase the reconstruction errors by reducing the stability of MIAs and enhance the target inference model by adversarial training, respectively.

In this paper, we propose MASR, a Metadata Aware Speech Representation learning framework, which addresses the aforementioned limitations. MASR enables the inclusion of multiple external knowledge sources to enhance the utilization of meta-data information. The external knowledge sources are incorporated in the form of sample-level pair-wise similarity matrices that are useful in a hard-mining loss. A key advantage of the MASR framework is that it can be combined with any choice of SSL method. Using MASR representations, we perform evaluations on several downstream tasks such as language identification, speech recognition and other non-semantic tasks such as speaker and emotion recognition. In these experiments, we illustrate significant performance improvements for the MASR over other established benchmarks. We perform a detailed analysis on the language identification task to provide insights on how the proposed loss function enables the representations to separate closely related languages. ",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing accurate 3D scenes from images is a long-standing vision task. Due to the ill-posedness of the single-image reconstruction problem, most well-established methods are built upon multi-view geometry. State-of-the-art (SOTA) monocular metric depth estimation methods can only handle a single camera model and are unable to perform mixed-data training due to the metric ambiguity. Meanwhile, SOTA monocular methods trained on large mixed datasets achieve zero-shot generalization by learning affine-invariant depths, which cannot recover real-world metrics. In this work, we show that the key to a zero-shot single-view metric depth model lies in the combination of large-scale data training and resolving the metric ambiguity from various camera models. We propose a canonical camera space transformation module, which explicitly addresses the ambiguity problems and can be effortlessly plugged into existing monocular models. Equipped with our module, monocular models can be stably trained with over 8 million images with thousands of camera models, resulting in zero-shot generalization to in-the-wild images with unseen camera settings. Experiments demonstrate SOTA performance of our method on 7 zero-shot benchmarks. Notably, our method won the championship in the 2nd Monocular Depth Estimation Challenge. Our method enables the accurate recovery of metric 3D structures on randomly collected internet images, paving the way for plausible single-image metrology. The potential benefits extend to downstream tasks, which can be significantly improved by simply plugging in our model. For example, our model relieves the scale drift issues of monocular-SLAM (Fig. 1), leading to high-quality metric scale dense mapping. The code is available at https://github.com/YvanYin/Metric3D. ",

Image-based biomarkers commonly used in the clinic, such as ejection fraction, fail to capture more complex patterns in the heart's 3D anatomy and thus limit diagnostic accuracy. In this work, we present the multi-objective point cloud autoencoder as a novel geometric deep learning approach for explainable infarction prediction, based on multi-class 3D point cloud representations of cardiac anatomy and function. Its architecture consists of multiple task-specific branches connected by a low-dimensional latent space to allow for effective multi-objective learning of both reconstruction and MI prediction, while capturing pathology-specific 3D shape information in an interpretable latent space. Furthermore, its hierarchical branch design with point cloud-based deep learning operations enables efficient multi-scale feature learning directly on high-resolution anatomy point clouds. In our experiments on a large UK Biobank dataset, the multi-objective point cloud autoencoder is able to accurately reconstruct multi-temporal 3D shapes with Chamfer distances between predicted and input anatomies below the underlying images' pixel resolution. Our method outperforms multiple machine learning and deep learning benchmarks for the task of incident MI prediction by 19% in terms of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. In addition, its task-specific compact latent space exhibits easily separable control and MI clusters with clinically plausible associations between subject encodings and corresponding 3D shapes, thus demonstrating the explainability of the prediction.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT), have demonstrated impressive prowess in solving a wide range of tasks with world knowledge, including knowledge-intensive tasks. However, it remains unclear how well LLMs are able to perceive their factual knowledge boundaries, particularly how they behave when incorporating retrieval augmentation. In this study, we present an initial analysis of the factual knowledge boundaries of LLMs and how retrieval augmentation affects LLMs on open-domain QA. Specially, we focus on three primary research questions and analyze them by examining QA performance, priori judgement and posteriori judgement of LLMs. We show evidence that LLMs possess unwavering confidence in their capabilities to respond to questions and the accuracy of their responses. Furthermore, retrieval augmentation proves to be an effective approach in enhancing LLMs' awareness of knowledge boundaries, thereby improving their judgemental abilities. Additionally, we also find that LLMs have a propensity to rely on the provided retrieval results when formulating answers, while the quality of these results significantly impacts their reliance.

    "abstract": "Recent work has shown that language models' (LMs) prompt-based learning capabilities make them well suited for automating data labeling in domains where manual annotation is expensive. The challenge is that while writing an initial prompt is cheap, improving a prompt is costly -- practitioners often require significant labeled data in order to evaluate the impact of prompt modifications. Our work asks whether it is possible to improve prompt-based learning without additional labeled data. We approach this problem by attempting to modify the predictions of a prompt, rather than the prompt itself. Our intuition is that accurate predictions should also be consistent: samples which are similar under some feature representation should receive the same prompt prediction. We propose Embroid, a method which computes multiple representations of a dataset under different embedding functions, and uses the consistency between the LM predictions for neighboring samples to identify mispredictions. Embroid then uses these neighborhoods to create additional predictions for each sample, and combines these predictions with a simple latent variable graphical model in order to generate a final corrected prediction. In addition to providing a theoretical analysis of Embroid, we conduct a rigorous empirical evaluation across six different LMs and up to 95 different tasks. We find that (1) Embroid substantially improves performance over original prompts (e.g., by an average of 7.3 points on GPT-JT), (2) also realizes improvements for more sophisticated prompting strategies (e.g., chain-of-thought), and (3) can be specialized to domains like law through the embedding functions.

While dominating on the COCO benchmark, recent Transformer-based detection methods are not competitive in diverse domains.

We jointly tackle the generalization to diverse domains and localization accuracy by proposing the Cascade Attention layer, which explicitly integrates object-centric information into the detection decoder by limiting the attention to the previous box prediction. To further enhance accuracy, we also revisit the scoring of queries. Instead of relying on classification scores, we predict the expected IoU of the query, leading to substantially more well-calibrated confidences. Lastly, we introduce a universal object detection benchmark, UDB10, that contains 10 datasets from diverse domains. While also advancing the state-of-the-art on COCO, Cascade-DETR substantially improves DETR-based detectors on all datasets in UDB10, even by over 10 mAP in some cases.

In this paper, we reveal discrepancies in data, model, and task between the pre-training and fine-tuning procedure in existing practices, which implicitly limit the detector's performance, generalization ability, and convergence speed. To this end, we propose AlignDet, a unified pre-training framework that can be adapted to various existing detectors to alleviate the discrepancies. AlignDet decouples the pre-training process into two stages, i.e., image-domain and box-domain pre-training. The image-domain pre-training optimizes the detection backbone to capture holistic visual abstraction, and box-domain pre-training learns instance-level semantics and task-aware concepts to initialize the parts out of the backbone. By incorporating the self-supervised pre-trained backbones, we can pre-train all modules for various detectors in an unsupervised paradigm. As depicted in Figure 1, extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignDet can achieve significant improvements across diverse protocols, such as detection algorithm, model backbone, data setting, and training schedule. For example, AlignDet improves FCOS by 5.3 mAP, RetinaNet by 2.1 mAP, Faster R-CNN by 3.3 mAP, and DETR by 2.3 mAP under fewer epochs. ",

This motivates us to propose 3D-IDS, a novel method that aims to tackle the above issues through two-step feature disentanglements and a dynamic graph diffusion scheme. Specifically, we first disentangle traffic features by a non-parameterized optimization based on mutual information, automatically differentiating tens and hundreds of complex features of various attacks. Such differentiated features will be fed into a memory model to generate representations, which are further disentangled to highlight the attack-specific features. Finally, we use a novel graph diffusion method that dynamically fuses the network topology for spatial-temporal aggregation in evolving data streams. By doing so, we can effectively identify various attacks in encrypted traffics, including unknown threats and known ones that are not easily detected. Experiments show the superiority of our 3D-IDS. We also demonstrate that our two-step feature disentanglements benefit the explainability of NIDS. ",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder(ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition that affects social communication and behavior. Investigating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-based brain functional connectome can aid in the understanding and diagnosis of ASD, leading to more effective treatments. The brain is modeled as a network of brain Regions of Interest (ROIs), and ROIs form communities and knowledge of these communities is crucial for ASD diagnosis. On the one hand, Transformer-based models have proven to be highly effective across several tasks, including fMRI connectome analysis to learn useful representations of ROIs. On the other hand, existing transformer-based models treat all ROIs equally and overlook the impact of community-specific associations when learning node embeddings. To fill this gap, we propose a novel method, Com-BrainTF, a hierarchical local-global transformer architecture that learns intra and inter-community aware node embeddings for ASD prediction task. Furthermore, we avoid over-parameterization by sharing the local transformer parameters for different communities but optimize unique learnable prompt tokens for each community. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) architecture on ABIDE dataset and has high interpretability, evident from the attention module.

    "abstract": "This study aims to develop and evaluate an innovative simulation algorithm for generating thick-slice CT images that closely resemble actual images in the AAPM-Mayo's 2016 Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset. The proposed method was evaluated using Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics, with the hypothesis that our simulation would produce images more congruent with their real counterparts. Our proposed method demonstrated substantial enhancements in terms of both PSNR and RMSE over other simulation methods. The highest PSNR values were obtained with the proposed method, yielding 49.7369 $\\pm$ 2.5223 and 48.5801 $\\pm$ 7.3271 for D45 and B30 reconstruction kernels, respectively. The proposed method also registered the lowest RMSE with values of 0.0068 $\\pm$ 0.0020 and 0.0108 $\\pm$ 0.0099 for D45 and B30, respectively, indicating a distribution more closely aligned with the authentic thick-slice image. Further validation of the proposed simulation algorithm was conducted using the TCIA LDCT-and-Projection-data dataset. The generated images were then leveraged to train four distinct super-resolution (SR) models, which were subsequently evaluated using the real thick-slice images from the 2016 Low Dose CT Grand Challenge dataset. When trained with data produced by our novel algorithm, all four SR models exhibited enhanced performance. ",

Images were reconstructed using backpropagation. Reconstructions were evaluated using the Wasserstein distance, mean squared error, and the structural similarity index measure.

    "abstract": "How does the brain represent different modes of information? Can we design a system that automatically understands what the user is thinking? Such questions can be answered by studying brain recordings like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). As a first step, the neuroscience community has contributed several large cognitive neuroscience datasets related to passive reading/listening/viewing of concept words, narratives, pictures and movies. Encoding and decoding models using these datasets have also been proposed in the past two decades. These models serve as additional tools for basic research in cognitive science and neuroscience. Encoding models aim at generating fMRI brain representations given a stimulus automatically. They have several practical applications in evaluating and diagnosing neurological conditions and thus also help design therapies for brain damage. Decoding models solve the inverse problem of reconstructing the stimuli given the fMRI. They are useful for designing brain-machine or brain-computer interfaces. Inspired by the effectiveness of deep learning models for natural language processing, computer vision, and speech, recently several neural encoding and decoding models have been proposed. In this survey, we will first discuss popular representations of language, vision and speech stimuli, and present a summary of neuroscience datasets. Further, we will review popular deep learning based encoding and decoding architectures and note their benefits and limitations. Finally, we will conclude with a brief summary and discussion about future trends. Given the large amount of recently published work in the `computational cognitive neuroscience' community, we believe that this survey nicely organizes the plethora of work and presents it as a coherent story.

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the challenges of detecting and categorizing small drones with radar automatic target recognition (ATR) technology. The authors suggest integrating ATR capabilities into drone detection radar systems to improve performance and manage emerging threats. The study focuses primarily on drones in Group 1 and 2. The paper highlights the need to consider kinetic features and signal signatures, such as micro-Doppler, in ATR techniques to efficiently recognize small drones. The authors also present a comprehensive drone detection radar system design that balances detection and tracking requirements, incorporating parameter adjustment based on scattering region theory. They offer an example of a performance improvement achieved using feedback and situational awareness mechanisms with the integrated ATR capabilities. Furthermore, the paper examines challenges related to one-way attack drones and explores the potential of cognitive radar as a solution. The integration of ATR capabilities transforms a 3D radar system into a 4D radar system, resulting in improved drone detection performance. These advancements are useful in military, civilian, and commercial applications, and ongoing research and development efforts are essential to keep radar systems effective and ready to detect, track, and respond to emerging threats.

An understanding of the selection function of lens finding neural networks will be key to fully realising the potential of the large samples of strong gravitational lens systems that will be found in upcoming wide-field surveys. We use three training datasets, representative of those used to train galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-quasar lens finding neural networks. The networks preferentially select systems with larger Einstein radii and larger sources with more concentrated source-light distributions. Increasing the detection significance threshold to 12$\\sigma$ from 8$\\sigma$ results in 50 per cent of the selected strong lens systems having Einstein radii $\\theta_\\mathrm{E}$ $\\ge$ 1.04 arcsec from $\\theta_\\mathrm{E}$ $\\ge$ 0.879 arcsec, source radii $R_S$ $\\ge$ 0.194 arcsec from $R_S$ $\\ge$ 0.178 arcsec and source S\\'ersic indices $n_{\\mathrm{Sc}}^{\\mathrm{S}}$ $\\ge$ 2.62 from $n_{\\mathrm{Sc}}^{\\mathrm{S}}$ $\\ge$ 2.55. The model trained to find lensed quasars shows a stronger preference for higher lens ellipticities than those trained to find lensed galaxies. The selection function is independent of the slope of the power-law of the mass profiles, hence measurements of this quantity will be unaffected. The lens finder selection function reinforces that of the lensing cross-section, and thus we expect our findings to be a general result for all galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-quasar lens finding neural networks.

We propose a multi-arm extension of a KF-based DL approximator that can mimic DL when the sample size is too small to train a multi-arm DL. The proposed Matrix Ensemble Kalman Filter-based multi-arm ANN (MEnKF-ANN) also performs explicit model stacking that becomes relevant when the training sample has an unequal-size feature set. Our proposed technique can approximate Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) Networks and attach uncertainty to the predictions obtained from these LSTMs with desirable coverage. We demonstrate how MEnKF-ANN can \"adequately\" approximate an LSTM network trained to classify what carbohydrate substrates are digested and utilized by a microbiome sample whose genomic sequences consist of polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) and their encoded genes.

However, current hardware is not advanced enough to execute fault-tolerant quantum algorithms. An alternative of using hybrid quantum-classical computing with variational algorithms can exhibit barren plateau issues, causing slow convergence of gradient-based optimization techniques. In this paper, we discuss \"post-variational strategies\", which shift tunable parameters from the quantum computer to the classical computer, opting for ensemble strategies when optimizing quantum models. We discuss various strategies and design principles for constructing individual quantum circuits, where the resulting ensembles can be optimized with convex programming. Further, we discuss architectural designs of post-variational quantum neural networks and analyze the propagation of estimation errors throughout such neural networks. Lastly, we show that our algorithm can be applied to real-world applications such as image classification on handwritten digits, producing a 96% classification accuracy. ",

The central idea of the proposed framework is to transmit the values and positions of the top-$S$ entries of a local model update for uplink transmission. A lossless encoding technique is considered for transmitting the positions of these entries, while a linear transformation followed by the Lloyd-Max scalar quantization is considered for transmitting their values. For an accurate reconstruction of the top-$S$ values, a linear minimum mean squared error method is developed based on the Bussgang decomposition. Moreover, an error feedback strategy is introduced to compensate for both compression and reconstruction errors. The convergence rate of the proposed framework is analyzed for a non-convex loss function with consideration of the compression and reconstruction errors. From the analytical result, the key parameters of the proposed framework are optimized for maximizing the convergence rate for the given capacity. Simulation results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art FL frameworks in terms of classification accuracy under the limited uplink capacity.

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and early screening is critical for improving survival outcomes. In clinical practice, the contextual structure of nodules and the accumulated experience of radiologists are the two core elements related to the accuracy of identification of benign and malignant nodules. Contextual information provides comprehensive information about nodules such as location, shape, and peripheral vessels, and experienced radiologists can search for clues from previous cases as a reference to enrich the basis of decision-making. In this paper, we propose a radiologist-inspired method to simulate the diagnostic process of radiologists, which is composed of context parsing and prototype recalling modules. The context parsing module first segments the context structure of nodules and then aggregates contextual information for a more comprehensive understanding of the nodule. The prototype recalling module utilizes prototype-based learning to condense previously learned cases as prototypes for comparative analysis, which is updated online in a momentum way during training. Building on the two modules, our method leverages both the intrinsic characteristics of the nodules and the external knowledge accumulated from other nodules to achieve a sound diagnosis. To meet the needs of both low-dose and noncontrast screening, we collect a large-scale dataset of 12,852 and 4,029 nodules from low-dose and noncontrast CTs respectively, each with pathology- or follow-up-confirmed labels. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that our method achieves advanced screening performance on both low-dose and noncontrast scenarios. ",

In this work, we propose the Point Cloud Deformation Network (PCD-Net) as a novel geometric deep learning approach to model 3D cardiac contraction and relaxation between the extreme ends of the cardiac cycle. It employs the recent advances in point cloud-based deep learning into an encoder-decoder structure, in order to enable efficient multi-scale feature learning directly on multi-class 3D point cloud representations of the cardiac anatomy. We evaluate our approach on a large dataset of over 10,000 cases from the UK Biobank study and find average Chamfer distances between the predicted and ground truth anatomies below the pixel resolution of the underlying image acquisition. Furthermore, we observe similar clinical metrics between predicted and ground truth populations and show that the PCD-Net can successfully capture subpopulation-specific differences between normal subjects and myocardial infarction (MI) patients. We then demonstrate that the learned 3D deformation patterns outperform multiple clinical benchmarks by 13% and 7% in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the tasks of prevalent MI detection and incident MI prediction and by 7% in terms of Harrell's concordance index for MI survival analysis.

Our approach utilizes GW waveform data obtained from numerical relativity simulations in the SXS Waveform catalog. By combining these two approaches, we leverage the strengths of both paradigms, enabling a comprehensive and accurate prediction of spin magnitudes. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves an impressive root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.05 and mean-squared-error (MSE) of 0.03 for the NSA model and an RMSE of 0.12 for the symbolic regression model alone. We train this model to handle higher-order multipole waveforms, with a specific focus on eccentric candidates, which are known to exhibit unique characteristics. Our results provide a robust and interpretable framework for predicting spin magnitudes in mergers.
