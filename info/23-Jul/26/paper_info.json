    "abstract": "Graph structure patterns are widely used to model different area data recently. How to detect anomalous graph information on these graph data has become a popular research problem. The objective of this research is centered on the particular issue that how to detect abnormal graphs within a graph set. The previous works have observed that abnormal graphs mainly show node-level and graph-level anomalies, but these methods equally treat two anomaly forms above in the evaluation of abnormal graphs, which is contrary to the fact that different types of abnormal graph data have different degrees in terms of node-level and graph-level anomalies. Furthermore, abnormal graphs that have subtle differences from normal graphs are easily escaped detection by the existing methods. Thus, we propose a multi-representations space separation based graph-level anomaly-aware detection framework in this paper. To consider the different importance of node-level and graph-level anomalies, we design an anomaly-aware module to learn the specific weight between them in the abnormal graph evaluation process. In addition, we learn strictly separate normal and abnormal graph representation spaces by four types of weighted graph representations against each other including anchor normal graphs, anchor abnormal graphs, training normal graphs, and training abnormal graphs. Based on the distance error between the graph representations of the test graph and both normal and abnormal graph representation spaces, we can accurately determine whether the test graph is anomalous. Our approach has been extensively evaluated against baseline methods using ten public graph datasets, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness. ",

    "title": "Sparse-firing regularization methods for spiking neural networks with  time-to-first spike coding",
    "abstract": "The training of multilayer spiking neural networks (SNNs) using the error backpropagation algorithm has made significant progress in recent years. Among the various training schemes, the error backpropagation method that directly uses the firing time of neurons has attracted considerable attention because it can realize ideal temporal coding. This method uses time-to-first spike (TTFS) coding, in which each neuron fires at most once, and this restriction on the number of firings enables information to be processed at a very low firing frequency. This low firing frequency increases the energy efficiency of information processing in SNNs, which is important not only because of its similarity with information processing in the brain, but also from an engineering point of view. However, only an upper limit has been provided for TTFS-coded SNNs, and the information-processing capability of SNNs at lower firing frequencies has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we propose two spike timing-based sparse-firing (SSR) regularization methods to further reduce the firing frequency of TTFS-coded SNNs. The first is the membrane potential-aware SSR (M-SSR) method, which has been derived as an extreme form of the loss function of the membrane potential value. The second is the firing condition-aware SSR (F-SSR) method, which is a regularization function obtained from the firing conditions. Both methods are characterized by the fact that they only require information about the firing timing and associated weights. The effects of these regularization methods were investigated on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets using multilayer perceptron networks and convolutional neural network structures. ",

In particular, image pooling transforms a connected discrete lattice into a reduced lattice with the same connectivity and allows reduction functions to consider all pixels in an image. However, there is no pooling that satisfies these properties for graphs. In fact, traditional graph pooling methods suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: Graph disconnection or overconnection, low decimation ratio, and deletion of large parts of graphs. In this paper, we present three pooling methods based on the notion of maximal independent sets that avoid these pitfalls. Our experimental results confirm the relevance of maximal independent set constraints for graph pooling. ",

Due to the undecidability of the problem of program equivalence, comparing two programs is highly challenging. Typically, in order to compare two programs, a relation between both programs' sets of variables is required. Thus, mapping variables between two programs is useful for a panoply of tasks such as program equivalence, program analysis, program repair, and clone detection. In this work, we propose using graph neural networks (GNNs) to map the set of variables between two programs based on both programs' abstract syntax trees (ASTs). To demonstrate the strength of variable mappings, we present three use-cases of these mappings on the task of program repair to fix well-studied and recurrent bugs among novice programmers in introductory programming assignments (IPAs). Experimental results on a dataset of 4166 pairs of incorrect/correct programs show that our approach correctly maps 83% of the evaluation dataset. Moreover, our experiments show that the current state-of-the-art on program repair, greatly dependent on the programs' structure, can only repair about 72% of the incorrect programs. In contrast, our approach, which is solely based on variable mappings, can repair around 88.5%. ",

This paper deals with a new type of patterns for tree data: common subtrees with identical label distribution. Their detection is far from obvious since the underlying isomorphism problem is graph isomorphism complete. An elaborated search algorithm is developed and analysed from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. Based on this, the enumeration of patterns is performed through a new lossless compression scheme for trees, called DAG-RW, whose complexity is investigated as well. The method shows very good properties, both in terms of computation times and analysis of real datasets from the literature. Compared to other substructures like topological subtrees and labelled subtrees for which the isomorphism problem is linear, the patterns found provide a more parsimonious representation of the data.

    "abstract": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection identifies test samples that differ from the training data, which is critical to ensuring the safety and reliability of machine learning (ML) systems. While a plethora of methods have been developed to detect uni-modal OOD samples, only a few have focused on multi-modal OOD detection. Current contrastive learning-based methods primarily study multi-modal OOD detection in a scenario where both a given image and its corresponding textual description come from a new domain. However, real-world deployments of ML systems may face more anomaly scenarios caused by multiple factors like sensor faults, bad weather, and environmental changes. Hence, the goal of this work is to simultaneously detect from multiple different OOD scenarios in a fine-grained manner. To reach this goal, we propose a general-purpose weakly-supervised OOD detection framework, called WOOD, that combines a binary classifier and a contrastive learning component to reap the benefits of both. In order to better distinguish the latent representations of in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, we adopt the Hinge loss to constrain their similarity. Furthermore, we develop a new scoring metric to integrate the prediction results from both the binary classifier and contrastive learning for identifying OOD samples. We evaluate the proposed WOOD model on multiple real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that the WOOD model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for multi-modal OOD detection. Importantly, our approach is able to achieve high accuracy in OOD detection in three different OOD scenarios simultaneously. The source code will be made publicly available upon publication. ",

    "abstract": "One of the hallmark symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the progressive loss of postural reflexes, which eventually leads to gait difficulties and balance problems. Identifying disruptions in brain function associated with gait impairment could be crucial in better understanding PD motor progression, thus advancing the development of more effective and personalized therapeutics. In this work, we present an explainable, geometric, weighted-graph attention neural network (xGW-GAT) to identify functional networks predictive of the progression of gait difficulties in individuals with PD. xGW-GAT predicts the multi-class gait impairment on the MDS Unified PD Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Our computational- and data-efficient model represents functional connectomes as symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices on a Riemannian manifold to explicitly encode pairwise interactions of entire connectomes, based on which we learn an attention mask yielding individual- and group-level explainability. Applied to our resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) dataset of individuals with PD, xGW-GAT identifies functional connectivity patterns associated with gait impairment in PD and offers interpretable explanations of functional subnetworks associated with motor impairment. Our model successfully outperforms several existing methods while simultaneously revealing clinically-relevant connectivity patterns.

    "abstract": "Camera-based autonomous systems that emulate human perception are increasingly being integrated into safety-critical platforms. Consequently, an established body of literature has emerged that explores adversarial attacks targeting the underlying machine learning models. Adapting adversarial attacks to the physical world is desirable for the attacker, as this removes the need to compromise digital systems. However, the real world poses challenges related to the \"survivability\" of adversarial manipulations given environmental noise in perception pipelines and the dynamicity of autonomous systems. In this paper, we take a sensor-first approach. We present EvilEye, a man-in-the-middle perception attack that leverages transparent displays to generate dynamic physical adversarial examples. EvilEye exploits the camera's optics to induce misclassifications under a variety of illumination conditions. To generate dynamic perturbations, we formalize the projection of a digital attack into the physical domain by modeling the transformation function of the captured image through the optical pipeline. Our extensive experiments show that EvilEye's generated adversarial perturbations are much more robust across varying environmental light conditions relative to existing physical perturbation frameworks, achieving a high attack success rate (ASR) while bypassing state-of-the-art physical adversarial detection frameworks. We demonstrate that the dynamic nature of EvilEye enables attackers to adapt adversarial examples across a variety of objects with a significantly higher ASR compared to state-of-the-art physical world attack frameworks. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies against the EvilEye attack. ",

This divide-and-conquer approach provides several important advantages. First, it enables us to overcome the scaling issue of symbolic regression algorithms. From a practical perspective, it enhances the portability of learned models for partial differential equation solvers written in different programming languages. Finally, it enables us to have a concrete understanding of the attributes of the materials, such as convexity and symmetries of models, through automated derivations and reasoning.

This paper formulates the interactions between CSAs and microgrid defenders as a non-cooperative, zero-sum game. Additionally, it presents a hybrid Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategy for distributed microgrids that can dynamically alter local control gains to achieve resiliency against Coordinated Stealth Attacks (CSAs). The proposed strategy reduces the success probability of attack(s) by making system dynamics less predictable. The framework also identifies and removes malicious injections by modifying secondary control weights assigned to them. The manipulated signals are reconstructed using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Digital Twin (DT) to preserve stability. To guarantee additional immunity against instability arising from gain alterations, MTD decisions are also validated (via utility and best response computations) using the DT before actual implementation. The DT is also used to find the minimum perturbation that defenders must achieve to invalidate an attacker's knowledge effectively. ",

Understanding the spread of misinformation and its social impacts requires identifying the news sources spreading false information. While machine learning (ML) techniques have been proposed to address this issue, ML models have failed to provide an efficient implementation scenario that yields useful results. In prior research, the precision of deployment in real traffic deteriorates significantly, experiencing a decrement up to ten times compared to the results derived from benchmark data sets. Our research addresses this gap by proposing a graph-based approach to capture navigational patterns and generate traffic-based features which are used to train a classification model. These navigational and traffic-based features result in classifiers that present outstanding performance when evaluated against real traffic. Moreover, we also propose graph-based filtering techniques to filter out models to be classified by our framework. These filtering techniques increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the models to be classified, greatly reducing false positives and the computational cost of deploying the model. Our proposed framework for the detection of misinformation domains achieves a precision of 0.78 when evaluated in real traffic. This outcome represents an improvement factor of over ten times over those achieved in previous studies. ",

Data interoperability is a key component to eliminate silos of information, and using semantic web technologies like the BRICK schema, an effort to standardize semantic descriptions of the physical, logical, and virtual assets in buildings and the relationships between them, is a suitable approach. However, current data integration processes can involve significant manual interventions. This paper presents a methodology to automatically collect, assemble, and integrate information from a building information model to a knowledge graph. The resulting application, called BIM-to-BRICK, is run on the SDE4 building located in Singapore. BIM-to-BRICK generated a bidirectional link between a BIM model of 932 instances and experimental data collected for 17 subjects into 458 BRICK objects and 1219 relationships in 17 seconds. The automation of this approach can be compared to traditional manual mapping of data types. This scientific innovation incentivizes the convergence of disparate data types and structures in built-environment applications. ",

    "abstract": "A useful capability is that of classifying some agent's behavior using data from a sequence, or trace, of sensor measurements. The sensor selection problem involves choosing a subset of available sensors to ensure that, when generated, observation traces will contain enough information to determine whether the agent's activities match some pattern. In generalizing prior work, this paper studies a formulation in which multiple behavioral itineraries may be supplied, with sensors selected to distinguish between behaviors. This allows one to pose fine grained questions, e.g., to position the agent's activity on a spectrum. In addition, with multiple itineraries, one can also ask about choices of sensors where some behavior is always plausibly concealed by (or mistaken for, or conflated with) another. Using sensor ambiguity to limit the acquisition of knowledge is a strong privacy guarantee, and one which some earlier work has examined. By concretely formulating privacy requirements for sensor selection, this paper connects both lines of work: privacy -- where there is a bound from above, and behavior verification -- where sensors are bounded from below. We examine the worst case computational complexity that results from both types of bounds, proving that upper bounds are more challenging under standard computational complexity assumptions. The problem is intractable in general, but we give a novel approach to solving this problem that can exploit interrelationships between constraints, and we see opportunities for a few optimizations. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the usefulness and scalability of our proposed solution, and to assess the impact of the optimizations. ",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to mine sentiment information from text, visual, and acoustic modalities. Previous works have focused on representation learning and feature fusion strategies. However, most of these efforts ignored the disparity in the semantic richness of different modalities and treated each modality in the same manner. That may lead to strong modalities being neglected and weak modalities being overvalued. Motivated by these observations, we propose a Text-oriented Modality Reinforcement Network (TMRN), which focuses on the dominance of the text modality in MSA. More specifically, we design a Text-Centered Cross-modal Attention (TCCA) module to make full interaction for text/acoustic and text/visual pairs, and a Text-Gated Self-Attention (TGSA) module to guide the self-reinforcement of the other two modalities. Furthermore, we present an adaptive fusion mechanism to decide the proportion of different modalities involved in the fusion process. Finally, we combine the feature matrices into vectors to get the final representation for the downstream tasks. Experimental results show that our TMRN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two MSA benchmarks. ",

A desirable property of GNNs is transferability, where a trained network can swap in information from a different graph without retraining and retain its accuracy. A recent method of capturing transferability of GNNs is through the use of graphons, which are symmetric, measurable functions representing the limit of large dense graphs. In this work, we contribute to the application of graphons to GNNs by presenting an explicit two-layer graphon neural network (WNN) architecture. We prove its ability to approximate bandlimited signals within a specified error tolerance using a minimal number of network weights. We then leverage this result, to establish the transferability of an explicit two-layer GNN over all sufficiently large graphs in a sequence converging to a graphon. Our work addresses transferability between both deterministic weighted graphs and simple random graphs and overcomes issues related to the curse of dimensionality that arise in other GNN results. The proposed WNN and GNN architectures offer practical solutions for handling graph data of varying sizes while maintaining performance guarantees without extensive retraining. ",

    "abstract": "Predicting lower limb motion intent is vital for controlling exoskeleton robots and prosthetic limbs. Surface electromyography (sEMG) attracts increasing attention in recent years as it enables ahead-of-time prediction of motion intentions before actual movement. However, the estimation performance of human joint trajectory remains a challenging problem due to the inter- and intra-subject variations. The former is related to physiological differences (such as height and weight) and preferred walking patterns of individuals, while the latter is mainly caused by irregular and gait-irrelevant muscle activity. This paper proposes a model integrating two gait cycle-inspired learning strategies to mitigate the challenge for predicting human knee joint trajectory. The first strategy is to decouple knee joint angles into motion patterns and amplitudes former exhibit low variability while latter show high variability among individuals. By learning through separate network entities, the model manages to capture both the common and personalized gait features. In the second, muscle principal activation masks are extracted from gait cycles in a prolonged walk. These masks are used to filter out components unrelated to walking from raw sEMG and provide auxiliary guidance to capture more gait-related features. Experimental results indicate that our model could predict knee angles with the average root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.03(0.49) degrees and 50ms ahead of time. To our knowledge this is the best performance in relevant literatures that has been reported, with reduced RMSE by at least 9.5%. ",

Most existing works simply propose typical FL systems for single-modal data, thus limiting its potential on exploiting valuable multimodal data for future personalized applications. Furthermore, the majority of FL approaches still rely on the labeled data at the client side, which is limited in real-world applications due to the inability of self-annotation from users. In light of these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal FL framework that employs a semi-supervised learning approach to leverage the representations from different modalities. Bringing this concept into a system, we develop a distillation-based multimodal embedding knowledge transfer mechanism, namely FedMEKT, which allows the server and clients to exchange the joint knowledge of their learning models extracted from a small multimodal proxy dataset. Our FedMEKT iteratively updates the generalized global encoders with the joint embedding knowledge from the participating clients. Thereby, to address the modality discrepancy and labeled data constraint in existing FL systems, our proposed FedMEKT comprises local multimodal autoencoder learning, generalized multimodal autoencoder construction, and generalized classifier learning. Through extensive experiments on three multimodal human activity recognition datasets, we demonstrate that FedMEKT achieves superior global encoder performance on linear evaluation and guarantees user privacy for personal data and model parameters while demanding less communication cost than other baselines.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised anomaly detection methods leverage a few anomaly examples to yield drastically improved performance compared to unsupervised models. However, they still suffer from two limitations: 1) unlabeled anomalies (i.e., anomaly contamination) may mislead the learning process when all the unlabeled data are employed as inliers for model training; 2) only discrete supervision information (such as binary or ordinal data labels) is exploited, which leads to suboptimal learning of anomaly scores that essentially take on a continuous distribution. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised anomaly detection method, which devises \\textit{contamination-resilient continuous supervisory signals}. Specifically, we propose a mass interpolation method to diffuse the abnormality of labeled anomalies, thereby creating new data samples labeled with continuous abnormal degrees. Meanwhile, the contaminated area can be covered by new data samples generated via combinations of data with correct labels. A feature learning-based objective is added to serve as an optimization constraint to regularize the network and further enhance the robustness w.r.t. anomaly contamination. Extensive experiments on 11 real-world datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art competitors by 20%-30% in AUC-PR and obtains more robust and superior performance in settings with different anomaly contamination levels and varying numbers of labeled anomalies.

    "abstract": "We study the open question of how players learn to play a social optimum pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) through repeated interactions in general-sum coordination games. A social optimum of a game is the stable Pareto-optimal state that provides a maximum return in the sum of all players' payoffs (social welfare) and always exists. We consider finite repeated games where each player only has access to its own utility (or payoff) function but is able to exchange information with other players. We develop a novel regret matching (RM) based algorithm for computing an efficient PSNE solution that could approach a desired Pareto-optimal outcome yielding the highest social welfare among all the attainable equilibria in the long run. Our proposed learning procedure follows the regret minimization framework but extends it in three major ways: (1) agents use global, instead of local, utility for calculating regrets, (2) each agent maintains a small and diminishing exploration probability in order to explore various PSNEs, and (3) agents stay with the actions that achieve the best global utility thus far, regardless of regrets. We prove that these three extensions enable the algorithm to select the stable social optimum equilibrium instead of converging to an arbitrary or cyclic equilibrium as in the conventional RM approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a set of applications in multi-agent distributed control, including a large-scale resource allocation game and a hard combinatorial task assignment problem for which no efficient (polynomial) solution exists.

    "abstract": "The robust balancing capability of humanoid robots against disturbances has been considered as one of the crucial requirements for their practical mobility in real-world environments. In particular, many studies have been devoted to the efficient implementation of the three balance strategies, inspired by human balance strategies involving ankle, hip, and stepping strategies, to endow humanoid robots with human-level balancing capability. In this paper, a robust balance control framework for humanoid robots is proposed. Firstly, a novel Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is proposed for Capture Point (CP) tracking control, enabling the integration of ankle, hip, and stepping strategies within a single framework. Additionally, a variable weighting method is introduced that adjusts the weighting parameters of the Centroidal Angular Momentum (CAM) damping control over the time horizon of MPC to improve the balancing performance. Secondly, a hierarchical structure of the MPC and a stepping controller was proposed, allowing for the step time optimization. The robust balancing performance of the proposed method is validated through extensive simulations and real robot experiments. Furthermore, a superior balancing performance is demonstrated, particularly in the presence of disturbances, compared to a state-of-the-art Quadratic Programming (QP)-based CP controller that employs the ankle, hip, and stepping strategies.

    "abstract": "Due to the enormous technical challenges and wide range of applications, scene text recognition (STR) has been an active research topic in computer vision for years. To tackle this tough problem, numerous innovative methods have been successively proposed, and incorporating linguistic knowledge into STR models has recently become a prominent trend. In this work, we first draw inspiration from the recent progress in Vision Transformer (ViT) to construct a conceptually simple yet functionally powerful vision STR model, which is built upon ViT and a tailored Adaptive Addressing and Aggregation (A$^3$) module. It already outperforms most previous state-of-the-art models for scene text recognition, including both pure vision models and language-augmented methods. To integrate linguistic knowledge, we further propose a Multi-Granularity Prediction strategy to inject information from the language modality into the model in an implicit way, \\ie, subword representations (BPE and WordPiece) widely used in NLP are introduced into the output space, in addition to the conventional character level representation, while no independent language model (LM) is adopted. To produce the final recognition results, two strategies for effectively fusing the multi-granularity predictions are devised. The resultant algorithm (termed MGP-STR) is able to push the performance envelope of STR to an even higher level. Specifically, MGP-STR achieves an average recognition accuracy of $94\\%$ on standard benchmarks for scene text recognition. Moreover, it also achieves state-of-the-art results on widely-used handwritten benchmarks as well as more challenging scene text datasets, demonstrating the generality of the proposed MGP-STR algorithm.

Existing graph-based methods for VideoQA usually ignore keywords in questions and employ a simple graph to aggregate features without considering relative relations between objects, which may lead to inferior performance. In this paper, we propose a Keyword-aware Relative Spatio-Temporal (KRST) graph network for VideoQA. First, to make question features aware of keywords, we employ an attention mechanism to assign high weights to keywords during question encoding. The keyword-aware question features are then used to guide video graph construction. Second, because relations are relative, we integrate the relative relation modeling to better capture the spatio-temporal dynamics among object nodes. Moreover, we disentangle the spatio-temporal reasoning into an object-level spatial graph and a frame-level temporal graph, which reduces the impact of spatial and temporal relation reasoning on each other. Extensive experiments on the TGIF-QA, MSVD-QA and MSRVTT-QA datasets demonstrate the superiority of our KRST over multiple state-of-the-art methods. ",

Conventional approaches to embedding multiple specific attributes into a single network often result in entanglement, where fine-grained features of each attribute cannot be identified separately. To address this problem, we propose a Conditional Cross-Attention Network that induces disentangled multi-space embeddings for various specific attributes with only a single backbone. Firstly, we employ a cross-attention mechanism to fuse and switch the information of conditions (specific attributes), and we demonstrate its effectiveness through a diverse visualization example.

To address the issues, we propose a practical, executable, inconspicuous and low computational adversarial attack based on LED illumination modulation. To fool the systems, the proposed attack generates imperceptible luminance changes to human eyes through fast intensity modulation of scene LED illumination and uses the rolling shutter effect of CMOS image sensors in face recognition systems to implant luminance information perturbation to the captured face images. In summary,we present a denial-of-service (DoS) attack for face detection and a dodging attack for face verification. We also evaluate their effectiveness against well-known face detection models, Dlib, MTCNN and RetinaFace , and face verification models, Dlib, FaceNet,and ArcFace.The extensive experiments show that the success rates of DoS attacks against face detection models reach 97.67%, 100%, and 100%, respectively, and the success rates of dodging attacks against all face verification models reach 100%.

    "abstract": "Machine learning makes multimedia data (e.g., images) more attractive, however, multimedia data is usually distributed and privacy sensitive. Multiple distributed multimedia clients can resort to federated learning (FL) to jointly learn a global shared model without requiring to share their private samples with any third-party entities. In this paper, we show that FL suffers from the cross-client generative adversarial networks (GANs)-based (C-GANs) attack, in which a malicious client (i.e., adversary) can reconstruct samples with the same distribution as the training samples from other clients (i.e., victims). Since a benign client's data can be leaked to the adversary, this attack brings the risk of local data leakage for clients in many security-critical FL applications. Thus, we propose Fed-EDKD (i.e., Federated Ensemble Data-free Knowledge Distillation) technique to improve the current popular FL schemes to resist C-GANs attack. In Fed-EDKD, each client submits a local model to the server for obtaining an ensemble global model. Then, to avoid model expansion, Fed-EDKD adopts data-free knowledge distillation techniques to transfer knowledge from the ensemble global model to a compressed model. By this way, Fed-EDKD reduces the adversary's control capability over the global model, so Fed-EDKD can effectively mitigate C-GANs attack. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that Fed-EDKD significantly mitigates C-GANs attack while only incurring a slight accuracy degradation of FL. ",

    "title": "Learning Autonomous Ultrasound via Latent Task Representation and  Robotic Skills Adaptation",
    "abstract": "As medical ultrasound is becoming a prevailing examination approach nowadays, robotic ultrasound systems can facilitate the scanning process and prevent professional sonographers from repetitive and tedious work. Despite the recent progress, it is still a challenge to enable robots to autonomously accomplish the ultrasound examination, which is largely due to the lack of a proper task representation method, and also an adaptation approach to generalize learned skills across different patients. To solve these problems, we propose the latent task representation and the robotic skills adaptation for autonomous ultrasound in this paper. During the offline stage, the multimodal ultrasound skills are merged and encapsulated into a low-dimensional probability model through a fully self-supervised framework, which takes clinically demonstrated ultrasound images, probe orientations, and contact forces into account. During the online stage, the probability model will select and evaluate the optimal prediction. For unstable singularities, the adaptive optimizer fine-tunes them to near and stable predictions in high-confidence regions. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can generate complex ultrasound strategies for diverse populations and achieve significantly better quantitative results than our previous method.

    "title": "Overcoming Distribution Mismatch in Quantizing Image Super-Resolution  Networks",
    "abstract": "Quantization is a promising approach to reduce the high computational complexity of image super-resolution (SR) networks. However, compared to high-level tasks like image classification, low-bit quantization leads to severe accuracy loss in SR networks. This is because feature distributions of SR networks are significantly divergent for each channel or input image, and is thus difficult to determine a quantization range. Existing SR quantization works approach this distribution mismatch problem by dynamically adapting quantization ranges to the variant distributions during test time. However, such dynamic adaptation incurs additional computational costs that limit the benefits of quantization. Instead, we propose a new quantization-aware training framework that effectively Overcomes the Distribution Mismatch problem in SR networks without the need for dynamic adaptation. Intuitively, the mismatch can be reduced by directly regularizing the variance in features during training. However, we observe that variance regularization can collide with the reconstruction loss during training and adversely impact SR accuracy. Thus, we avoid the conflict between two losses by regularizing the variance only when the gradients of variance regularization are cooperative with that of reconstruction. Additionally, to further reduce the distribution mismatch, we introduce distribution offsets to layers with a significant mismatch, which either scales or shifts channel-wise features. Our proposed algorithm, called ODM, effectively reduces the mismatch in distributions with minimal computational overhead. Experimental results show that ODM effectively outperforms existing SR quantization approaches with similar or fewer computations, demonstrating the importance of reducing the distribution mismatch problem.

    "abstract": "The local road network information is essential for autonomous navigation. This information is commonly obtained from offline HD-Maps in terms of lane graphs. However, the local road network at a given moment can be drastically different than the one given in the offline maps; due to construction works, accidents etc. Moreover, the autonomous vehicle might be at a location not covered in the offline HD-Map. Thus, online estimation of the lane graph is crucial for widespread and reliable autonomous navigation. In this work, we tackle online Bird's-Eye-View lane graph extraction from a single onboard camera image. We propose to use prior information to increase quality of the estimations. The prior is extracted from the dataset through a transformer based Wasserstein Autoencoder. The autoencoder is then used to enhance the initial lane graph estimates. This is done through optimization of the latent space vector. The optimization encourages the lane graph estimation to be logical by discouraging it to diverge from the prior distribution. We test the method on two benchmark datasets, NuScenes and Argoverse. The results show that the proposed method significantly improves the performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. ",

While previous studies have focused on technological factors, little is known about the role of factors that affect human attention. In the present study, we investigated how the tasks used to elicit human attention maps interact with image characteristics in modulating the similarity between humans and CNN. We varied the intentionality of human tasks, ranging from spontaneous gaze during categorization over intentional gaze-pointing up to manual area selection. Moreover, we varied the type of image to be categorized, using either singular, salient objects, indoor scenes consisting of object arrangements, or landscapes without distinct objects defining the category. The human attention maps generated in this way were compared to the CNN attention maps revealed by explainable artificial intelligence (Grad-CAM). The influence of human tasks strongly depended on image type: For objects, human manual selection produced maps that were most similar to CNN, while the specific eye movement task has little impact. For indoor scenes, spontaneous gaze produced the least similarity, while for landscapes, similarity was equally low across all human tasks. To better understand these results, we also compared the different human attention maps to each other. Our results highlight the importance of taking human factors into account when comparing the attention of humans and CNN. ",

Specifically, 1) we propose a 3D Relative Position Multi-head Attention (3DRP-MA) module to analyze relative relations from different directions in the context of object pairs, which helps the model to focus on the specific object relations mentioned in the sentence. 2) We designed a soft-labeling strategy to alleviate the spatial ambiguity caused by redundant points, which further stabilizes and enhances the learning process through a constant and discriminative distribution.

The aim of the paper is to evaluate the performance of different embedding models for the task of automatic extraction and classification of acknowledged entities from the acknowledgment text in scientific papers. We trained and implemented a named entity recognition (NER) task using the Flair NLP framework. The training was conducted using three default Flair NER models with four differently-sized corpora and different versions of the Flair NLP framework. The Flair Embeddings model trained on the medium corpus with the latest FLAIR version showed the best accuracy of 0.79. Expanding the size of a training corpus from very small to medium size massively increased the accuracy of all training algorithms, but further expansion of the training corpus did not bring further improvement. Moreover, the performance of the model slightly deteriorated. Our model is able to recognize six entity types: funding agency, grant number, individuals, university, corporation, and miscellaneous. The model works more precisely for some entity types than for others; thus, individuals and grant numbers showed a very good F1-Score over 0.9. Most of the previous works on acknowledgment analysis were limited by the manual evaluation of data and therefore by the amount of processed data. This model can be applied for the comprehensive analysis of acknowledgment texts and may potentially make a great contribution to the field of automated acknowledgment analysis. ",

Calculating code coverage is resource-intensive, requiring code building and execution with additional overhead for the instrumentation. Furthermore, computing coverage of any snippet of code requires the whole program context. Using Machine Learning to amortize this expensive process could lower the cost of code coverage by requiring only the source code context, and the task of code coverage prediction can be a novel benchmark for judging the ability of models to understand code. We propose a novel benchmark task called Code Coverage Prediction for Large Language Models (LLMs). We formalize this task to evaluate the capability of LLMs in understanding code execution by determining which lines of a method are executed by a given test case and inputs. We curate and release a dataset we call COVERAGEEVAL by executing tests and code from the HumanEval dataset and collecting code coverage information. We report the performance of four state-of-the-art LLMs used for code-related tasks, including OpenAI's GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, Google's BARD, and Anthropic's Claude, on the Code Coverage Prediction task.

BotHawk can detect a wider variety of bots, including CI/CD and scanning bots.

All three paradigms are motivated by the same goal of finding two models -- a `focus' model that `selects' the right \\textit{segment} of the input and a `classification' model that processes the selected segment into the target label. However, they differ significantly in the way the selected segments are aggregated, resulting in distinct dynamics and final results. We observe a unique signature of models learned using these paradigms and explain this as a consequence of the evolution of the classification model under gradient descent when the focus model is fixed. We also analyze these paradigms in a simple setting and derive closed-form expressions for the parameter trajectory under gradient flow. With the soft attention loss, the focus model improves quickly at initialization and splutters later on. On the other hand, hard attention loss behaves in the opposite fashion. Based on our observations, we propose a simple hybrid approach that combines the advantages of the different loss functions and demonstrates it on a collection of semi-synthetic and real-world datasets ",

Existing successful solutions are based on the contrastive graph learning paradigm where graph neural networks (GNNs) are employed to learn representations from user-level and bundle-level graph views with a contrastive learning module to enhance the cooperative association between different views. Nevertheless, they ignore the uncertainty issue which has a significant impact in real bundle recommendation scenarios due to the lack of discriminative information caused by highly sparsity or diversity. We further suggest that their instancewise contrastive learning fails to distinguish the semantically similar negatives (i.e., sampling bias issue), resulting in performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel Gaussian Graph with Prototypical Contrastive Learning (GPCL) framework to overcome these challenges. In particular, GPCL embeds each user/bundle/item as a Gaussian distribution rather than a fixed vector. We further design a prototypical contrastive learning module to capture the contextual information and mitigate the sampling bias issue. Extensive experiments demonstrate that benefiting from the proposed components, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance compared to previous methods on several public datasets.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has made significant advancements in supervised learning. However, models trained in this setting often face challenges due to domain shift between training and test sets, resulting in a significant drop in performance during testing. To address this issue, several domain generalization methods have been developed to learn robust and domain-invariant features from multiple training domains that can generalize well to unseen test domains. Data augmentation plays a crucial role in achieving this goal by enhancing the diversity of the training data. In this paper, inspired by the observation that normalizing an image with different statistics generated by different batches with various domains can perturb its feature, we propose a simple yet effective method called NormAUG (Normalization-guided Augmentation). Our method includes two paths: the main path and the auxiliary (augmented) path. During training, the auxiliary path includes multiple sub-paths, each corresponding to batch normalization for a single domain or a random combination of multiple domains. This introduces diverse information at the feature level and improves the generalization of the main path. Moreover, our NormAUG method effectively reduces the existing upper boundary for generalization based on theoretical perspectives. During the test stage, we leverage an ensemble strategy to combine the predictions from the auxiliary path of our model, further boosting performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "Cardinality estimation methods based on probability distribution estimation have achieved high-precision estimation results compared to traditional methods. However, the most advanced methods suffer from high estimation costs due to the sampling method they use when dealing with range queries. Also, such a sampling method makes them difficult to differentiate, so the supervision signal from the query workload is difficult to train the model to improve the accuracy of cardinality estimation. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid and deterministic modeling approach (Duet) for the cardinality estimation problem which has better efficiency and scalability compared to previous approaches. Duet allows for direct cardinality estimation of range queries with significantly lower time and memory costs, as well as in a differentiable form. As the prediction process of this approach is differentiable, we can incorporate queries with larger model estimation errors into the training process to address the long-tail distribution problem of model estimation errors on high dimensional tables. We evaluate Duet on classical datasets and benchmarks, and the results prove the effectiveness of Duet. ",

    "abstract": "Current anti-money laundering (AML) systems, predominantly rule-based, exhibit notable shortcomings in efficiently and precisely detecting instances of money laundering. As a result, there has been a recent surge toward exploring alternative approaches, particularly those utilizing machine learning. Since criminals often collaborate in their money laundering endeavors, accounting for diverse types of customer relations and links becomes crucial. In line with this, the present paper introduces a graph neural network (GNN) approach to identify money laundering activities within a large heterogeneous network constructed from real-world bank transactions and business role data belonging to DNB, Norway's largest bank. Specifically, we extend the homogeneous GNN method known as the Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) to operate effectively on a heterogeneous graph. As part of this procedure, we propose a novel method for aggregating messages across different edges of the graph. Our findings highlight the importance of using an appropriate GNN architecture when combining information in heterogeneous graphs. The performance results of our model demonstrate great potential in enhancing the quality of electronic surveillance systems employed by banks to detect instances of money laundering. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published work applying GNN on a large real-world heterogeneous network for anti-money laundering purposes. ",

    "abstract": "Vision-based Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation is an emerging perception formulation for autonomous driving. The core challenge is to construct BEV space with multi-camera features, which is a one-to-many ill-posed problem. Diving into all previous BEV representation generation methods, we found that most of them fall into two types: modeling depths in image views or modeling heights in the BEV space, mostly in an implicit way. In this work, we propose to explicitly model heights in the BEV space, which needs no extra data like LiDAR and can fit arbitrary camera rigs and types compared to modeling depths. Theoretically, we give proof of the equivalence between height-based methods and depth-based methods. Considering the equivalence and some advantages of modeling heights, we propose HeightFormer, which models heights and uncertainties in a self-recursive way. Without any extra data, the proposed HeightFormer could estimate heights in BEV accurately. Benchmark results show that the performance of HeightFormer achieves SOTA compared with those camera-only methods. ",

Firstly, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the loss of interaction information in the two-stage HOI detector and propose a re-mining strategy to generate more comprehensive visual representation.Secondly, we design more fine-grained sentence- and word-level alignment and knowledge transfer strategies to effectively address the many-to-many matching problem between multiple interactions and multiple texts.These strategies alleviate the matching confusion problem that arises when multiple interactions occur simultaneously, thereby improving the effectiveness of the alignment process. Finally, HOI reasoning by visual features augmented with textual knowledge substantially improves the understanding of interactions.

However, accurate simulations like computational fluid dynamics are time and resource consuming which is why surrogate models are employed to speed-up the solution process. Machine Learning based surrogate models on the other hand are fast in predicting approximate solutions but often lack accuracy. Thus, the development of the predictor in a predictor-corrector approach is the focus here, where the surrogate model predicts a flow field and the numerical solver corrects it. This paper scales a state-of-the-art surrogate model from the domain of graph-based machine learning to industry-relevant mesh sizes of a numerical flow simulation. The approach partitions and distributes the flow domain to multiple GPUs and provides halo exchange between these partitions during training. The utilized graph neural network operates directly on the numerical mesh and is able to preserve complex geometries as well as all other properties of the mesh. The proposed surrogate model is evaluated with an application on a three dimensional turbomachinery setup and compared to a traditionally trained distributed model. The results show that the traditional approach produces superior predictions and outperforms the proposed surrogate model. Possible explanations, improvements and future directions are outlined. ",

The step (2) can be further enhanced by incorporating a weighting scheme that considers the significance of latent variables in the analysis. The results provide valuable insights into the benefits and challenges of employing neural network-based similarity analysis for discerning data patterns effectively. ",

This model shows superior performance over traditional ANNs in a variety of classification tasks. To reduce the computational cost of DIQNN, we introduce the Low-Rank DIQNN, while we find it can retain the performance of the original DIQNN. We further propose a margin to characterize the generalization error and theoretically prove this margin will increase monotonically during training. And we show the consistency between generalization and our margin using numerical experiments. Finally, by integrating this margin into the loss function, the change of test accuracy is indeed accelerated. Our work contributes a novel, brain-inspired ANN model that surpasses traditional ANNs and provides a theoretical framework to analyze the generalization error in classification tasks. ",

By simply sharing parameters and making a recursive decoder, the detector already obtains a significant improvement. The recursive decoder can be further enhanced by positional encoding (PE) of the proposal box, which makes it aware of the exact locations and sizes of input bounding boxes, thus becoming adaptive to proposals from different stages during the recursion. Moreover, we also design centerness-based PE to distinguish the RoI feature element and dynamic convolution kernels at different positions within the bounding box. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct intensive ablations and build the full model on three recent mainstream region-based detectors.

Next, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of backdoor attacks against VRSs from different perspectives and analyze the characteristic of different categories. After that, we comprehensively review existing attack methods and analyze their pros and cons based on the proposed criteria. Furthermore, we review classic backdoor defense methods and generic audio defense techniques. Then we discuss the feasibility of deploying them on VRSs.

While object-centric augmentations provide a great opportunity to overcome these issues, existing works are only focused on position and random transformations without considering shape variations of the objects. To this end, we propose a novel object-centric data augmentation model that is able to learn the shape variations for the objects of interest and augment the object in place without modifying the rest of the image. We demonstrated its effectiveness in improving kidney tumour segmentation when leveraging shape variations learned both from within the same dataset and transferred from external datasets. ",

While these systems can start processing queries quickly thanks to the agility and scalability of SL, they may encounter performance- and cost-bottlenecks based on workloads due to SL's worse performance and more expensive cost than traditional compute resources, e.g., virtual machine (VM). In this project, we introduce Smartpick, a SL-enabled scalable data analytics system that exploits SL and VM together to realize composite benefits, i.e., agility from SL and better performance with reduced cost from VM. Smartpick uses a machine learning prediction scheme, decision-tree based Random Forest with Bayesian Optimizer, to determine SL and VM configurations, i.e., how many SL and VM instances for queries, that meet cost-performance goals. Smartpick offers a knob for applications to allow them to explore a richer cost-performance tradeoff space opened by exploiting SL and VM together. To maximize the benefits of SL, Smartpick supports a simple but strong mechanism, called relay-instances. Smartpick also supports event-driven prediction model retraining to deal with workload dynamics. A Smartpick prototype was implemented on Spark and deployed on live test-beds, Amazon AWS and Google Cloud Platform. Evaluation results indicate 97.05% and 83.49% prediction accuracies respectively with up to 50% cost reduction as opposed to the baselines. The results also confirm that Smartpick allows data analytics applications to navigate the richer cost-performance tradeoff space efficiently and to handle workload dynamics effectively and automatically.

    "abstract": "Automatic protein function prediction (AFP) is classified as a large-scale multi-label classification problem aimed at automating protein enrichment analysis to eliminate the current reliance on labor-intensive wet-lab methods. Currently, popular methods primarily combine protein-related information and Gene Ontology (GO) terms to generate final functional predictions. For example, protein sequences, structural information, and protein-protein interaction networks are integrated as prior knowledge to fuse with GO term embeddings and generate the ultimate prediction results. However, these methods are limited by the difficulty in obtaining structural information or network topology information, as well as the accuracy of such data. Therefore, more and more methods that only use protein sequences for protein function prediction have been proposed, which is a more reliable and computationally cheaper approach. However, the existing methods fail to fully extract feature information from protein sequences or label data because they do not adequately consider the intrinsic characteristics of the data itself. Therefore, we propose a sequence-based hierarchical prediction method, DeepGATGO, which processes protein sequences and GO term labels hierarchically, and utilizes graph attention networks (GATs) and contrastive learning for protein function prediction. Specifically, we compute embeddings of the sequence and label data using pre-trained models to reduce computational costs and improve the embedding accuracy. Then, we use GATs to dynamically extract the structural information of non-Euclidean data, and learn general features of the label dataset with contrastive learning by constructing positive and negative example samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model exhibits better scalability in GO term enrichment analysis on large-scale datasets. ",

In this study, we compared a series of computational models for estimation of breast cancer PRS. A deep neural network (DNN) was found to outperform alternative machine learning techniques and established statistical algorithms, including BLUP, BayesA and LDpred. In the test cohort with 50% prevalence, the Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUC) were 67.4% for DNN, 64.2% for BLUP, 64.5% for BayesA, and 62.4% for LDpred. BLUP, BayesA, and LPpred all generated PRS that followed a normal distribution in the case population. However, the PRS generated by DNN in the case population followed a bi-modal distribution composed of two normal distributions with distinctly different means. This suggests that DNN was able to separate the case population into a high-genetic-risk case sub-population with an average PRS significantly higher than the control population and a normal-genetic-risk case sub-population with an average PRS similar to the control population. This allowed DNN to achieve 18.8% recall at 90% precision in the test cohort with 50% prevalence, which can be extrapolated to 65.4% recall at 20% precision in a general population with 12% prevalence. Interpretation of the DNN model identified salient variants that were assigned insignificant p-values by association studies, but were important for DNN prediction.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces feature gradient flow, a new technique for interpreting deep learning models in terms of features that are understandable to humans. The gradient flow of a model locally defines nonlinear coordinates in the input data space representing the information the model is using to make its decisions. Our idea is to measure the agreement of interpretable features with the gradient flow of a model. To then evaluate the importance of a particular feature to the model, we compare that feature's gradient flow measure versus that of a baseline noise feature. We then develop a technique for training neural networks to be more interpretable by adding a regularization term to the loss function that encourages the model gradients to align with those of chosen interpretable features. We test our method in a convolutional neural network prediction of distant metastasis of head and neck cancer from a computed tomography dataset from the Cancer Imaging Archive. ",

It is based on Neumann series of Bessel functions representations for solutions. With their aid the problem is reduced to a system of linear algebraic equations for the coefficients of the representations. The potential is recovered from an arithmetic combination of the first two coefficients. Special cases of the considered problems include the recovery of the potential from a Weyl function, the inverse two-spectra Sturm-Liouville problem as well as the recovery of the potential from the output boundary values of an incident wave interacting with the potential. The approach leads to efficient numerical algorithms for solving coefficient inverse problems. Numerical efficiency is illustrated by several examples. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has become a popular tool for medical image analysis, but the limited availability of training data remains a major challenge, particularly in the medical field where data acquisition can be costly and subject to privacy regulations. Data augmentation techniques offer a solution by artificially increasing the number of training samples, but these techniques often produce limited and unconvincing results. To address this issue, a growing number of studies have proposed the use of deep generative models to generate more realistic and diverse data that conform to the true distribution of the data. In this review, we focus on three types of deep generative models for medical image augmentation: variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. We provide an overview of the current state of the art in each of these models and discuss their potential for use in different downstream tasks in medical imaging, including classification, segmentation, and cross-modal translation. We also evaluate the strengths and limitations of each model and suggest directions for future research in this field. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive review about the use of deep generative models for medical image augmentation and to highlight the potential of these models for improving the performance of deep learning algorithms in medical image analysis.

The novelty of our approach lies in the use of a large amount of heterogeneous historical data. On the one hand, we built a network of interactions between people involved in the film field in Ibero-America during the first half of the twentieth century. On the other hand, we propose a $k$-core decomposition and a multi-layered analysis, as a quantitative way to study the position of women within the cultural melieu. After conducting our analysis, we concluded that women were mostly situated in the outer $k$-shells of the empirical network, and their distribution was not uniform across the $k$-shells. From a qualitative perspective, these results can be interpreted as the consequence of the lack of evidence of the participation of women in the public sphere. ",

However, manual evaluation can be time-consuming, expensive, and prone to inter- and intra-observer variability. Objective: To assist pathologists using computerized solutions, automated tissue structure detection and segmentation must be proposed. Furthermore, generating pixel-level object annotations for histopathology images is expensive and time-consuming. As a result, detection models with bounding box labels may be a feasible solution. Design: This paper studies. YOLO-v4 (You-Only-Look-Once), a real-time object detector for microscopic images. YOLO uses a single neural network to predict several bounding boxes and class probabilities for objects of interest. YOLO can enhance detection performance by training on whole slide images. YOLO-v4 has been used in this paper. for glomeruli detection in human kidney images. Multiple experiments have been designed and conducted based on different training data of two public datasets and a private dataset from the University of Michigan for fine-tuning the model. The model was tested on the private dataset from the University of Michigan, serving as an external validation of two different stains, namely hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). Results: Average specificity and sensitivity for all experiments, and comparison of existing segmentation methods on the same datasets are discussed. Conclusions: Automated glomeruli detection in human kidney images is possible using modern AI models. The design and validation for different stains still depends on variability of public multi-stain datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Deep hedging is a deep-learning-based framework for derivative hedging in incomplete markets. The advantage of deep hedging lies in its ability to handle various realistic market conditions, such as market frictions, which are challenging to address within the traditional mathematical finance framework. Since deep hedging relies on market simulation, the underlying asset price process model is crucial. However, existing literature on deep hedging often relies on traditional mathematical finance models, e.g., Brownian motion and stochastic volatility models, and discovering effective underlying asset models for deep hedging learning has been a challenge. In this study, we propose a new framework called adversarial deep hedging, inspired by adversarial learning. In this framework, a hedger and a generator, which respectively model the underlying asset process and the underlying asset process, are trained in an adversarial manner. The proposed method enables to learn a robust hedger without explicitly modeling the underlying asset process. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance to models that assume explicit underlying asset processes across various real market data. ",

Agents in the network form private beliefs about such hypotheses by aggregating their neighbors' publicly stated beliefs, in an iterative fashion. This process allows us to keep track of scenarios where private and public beliefs align, leading to population-wide consensus on the ground truth, as well as scenarios where the two sets of beliefs fail to converge. The latter scenario - which is reminiscent of the phenomenon of cognitive dissonance - is induced by injecting 'conspirators' in the network, i.e., agents who actively spread disinformation by not communicating accurately their private beliefs. We show that the agents' cognitive dissonance non-trivially reaches its peak when conspirators are a relatively small minority of the population, and that such an effect can be mitigated - although not erased - by the presence of 'debunker' agents in the network.

    "abstract": "Quantum devices should operate in adherence to quantum physics principles. Quantum random access memory (QRAM), a fundamental component of many essential quantum algorithms for tasks such as linear algebra, data search, and machine learning, is often proposed to offer $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$ circuit depth for $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ data size, given $N$ qubits. However, this claim appears to breach the principle of relativity when dealing with a large number of qubits in quantum materials interacting locally. In our study we critically explore the intrinsic bounds of rapid quantum memories based on causality, employing the relativistic quantum field theory and Lieb-Robinson bounds in quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we consider a hardware-efficient QRAM design in hybrid quantum acoustic systems. Assuming clock cycle times of approximately $10^{-3}$ seconds and a lattice spacing of about 1 micrometer, we show that QRAM can accommodate up to $\\mathcal{O}(10^7)$ logical qubits in 1 dimension, $\\mathcal{O}(10^{15})$ to $\\mathcal{O}(10^{20})$ in various 2D architectures, and $\\mathcal{O}(10^{24})$ in 3 dimensions. We contend that this causality bound broadly applies to other quantum hardware systems. Our findings highlight the impact of fundamental quantum physics constraints on the long-term performance of quantum computing applications in data science and suggest potential quantum memory designs for performance enhancement.

The inferred ranking of each node is real-valued and varies in time as each new edge, encoding an outcome like a win or loss, raises or lowers the node's estimated strength or prestige, as is often observed in real scenarios including sequences of games, tournaments, or interactions in animal hierarchies. Our method works by solving a linear system of equations and requires only one parameter to be tuned. As a result, the corresponding algorithm is scalable and efficient. We test our method by evaluating its ability to predict interactions (edges' existence) and their outcomes (edges' directions) in a variety of applications, including both synthetic and real data. Our analysis shows that in many cases our method's performance is better than existing methods for predicting dynamic rankings and interaction outcomes. ",

With more distributed networks that need to support customers in different locations, the model of one-single server in big financial centres has become outdated and companies tend to look for alternatives that will meet their needs, and this seems to be the case with Fortaleza, in Brazil. With several submarine cables connections available, the city has stood out as a possible hub to different regions, and this is what this paper explores. Making use of real traffic data through looking glasses, we established a latency classification that ranges from exceptionally low to high and analysed 800 latencies from Roubaix, Fortaleza and Sao Paulo to Miami, Mexico City, Frankfurt, Paris, Milan, Prague, Sao Paulo, Santiago, Buenos Aires and Luanda. We found that non-developed countries have a big dependence on the United States to route Internet traffic. Despite this, Fortaleza proves to be an alternative for serving different regions with relatively low latencies. ",
