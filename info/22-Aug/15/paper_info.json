    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks have been used in a wide variety of applications with significant success. However, their highly complex nature owing to comprising millions of parameters has lead to problems during deployment in pipelines with low latency requirements. As a result, it is more desirable to obtain lightweight neural networks which have the same performance during inference time. In this work, we propose a weight based pruning approach in which the weights are pruned gradually based on their momentum of the previous iterations. Each layer of the neural network is assigned an importance value based on their relative sparsity, followed by the magnitude of the weight in the previous iterations. We evaluate our approach on networks such as AlexNet, VGG16 and ResNet50 with image classification datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. We found that the results outperformed the previous approaches with respect to accuracy and compression ratio. Our method is able to obtain a compression of 15% for the same degradation in accuracy on both the datasets. ",

    "title": "Prevalence and scalable control of localized networks",
    "abstract": "The ability to control network dynamics is essential for ensuring desirable functionality of many technological, biological, and social systems. Such systems often consist of a large number of network elements, and controlling large-scale networks remains challenging because the computation and communication requirements increase prohibitively fast with network size. Here, we introduce a notion of network locality that can be exploited to make the control of networks scalable even when the dynamics are nonlinear. We show that network locality is captured by an information metric and is almost universally observed across real and model networks. In localized networks, the optimal control actions and system responses are both shown to be necessarily concentrated in small neighborhoods induced by the information metric. This allows us to develop localized algorithms for determining network controllability and optimizing the placement of driver nodes. This also allows us to develop a localized algorithm for designing local feedback controllers that approach the performance of the corresponding best global controllers while incurring a computational cost orders-of-magnitude lower. We validate the locality, performance, and efficiency of the algorithms in Kuramoto oscillator networks as well as three large empirical networks: synchronization dynamics in the Eastern U.S. power grid, epidemic spreading mediated by the global air transportation network, and Alzheimer's disease dynamics in a human brain network. Taken together, our results establish that large networks can be controlled with computation and communication costs comparable to those for small networks. ",

This paper presents a deep-learning-based automatic detection model SeMaCNN for classification and semantic segmentation of electroluminescent images for solar cell quality evaluation and anomalies detection. The core of the model is an anomaly detection algorithm based on Mahalanobis distance that can be trained in a semi-supervised manner on imbalanced data with small number of digital electroluminescence images with relevant defects. This is particularly valuable for prompt model integration into the industrial landscape. The model has been trained with the on-plant collected dataset consisting of 68 748 electroluminescent images of heterojunction solar cells with a busbar grid. Our model achieves the accuracy of 92.5%, F1 score 95.8%, recall 94.8%, and precision 96.9% within the validation subset consisting of 1049 manually annotated images. The model was also tested on the open ELPV dataset and demonstrates stable performance with accuracy 94.6% and F1 score 91.1%.

    "title": "Smoothed Analysis of Information Spreading in Dynamic Networks",
    "abstract": "The best known solutions for $k$-message broadcast in dynamic networks of size $n$ require $\\Omega(nk)$ rounds. In this paper, we see if these bounds can be improved by smoothed analysis. We study perhaps the most natural randomized algorithm for disseminating tokens in this setting: at every time step, choose a token to broadcast randomly from the set of tokens you know. We show that with even a small amount of smoothing (one random edge added per round), this natural strategy solves $k$-message broadcast in $\\tilde{O}(n+k^3)$ rounds, with high probability, beating the best known bounds for $k=o(\\sqrt{n})$ and matching the $\\Omega(n+k)$ lower bound for static networks for $k=O(n^{1/3})$ (ignoring logarithmic factors). In fact, the main result we show is even stronger and more general: given $\\ell$-smoothing (i.e., $\\ell$ random edges added per round), this simple strategy terminates in $O(kn^{2/3}\\log^{1/3}(n)\\ell^{-1/3})$ rounds. We then prove this analysis close to tight with an almost-matching lower bound. To better understand the impact of smoothing on information spreading, we next turn our attention to static networks, proving a tight bound of $\\tilde{O}(k\\sqrt{n})$ rounds to solve $k$-message broadcast, which is better than what our strategy can achieve in the dynamic setting. This confirms that although smoothed analysis reduces the difficulties induced by changing graph structures, it does not eliminate them altogether. Finally, we apply our tools to prove an optimal result for $k$-message broadcast in so-called well-mixed networks in the absence of smoothing. By comparing this result to an existing lower bound for well-mixed networks, we establish a formal separation between oblivious and strongly adaptive adversaries with respect to well-mixed token spreading, partially resolving an open question on the impact of adversary strength on the $k$-message broadcast problem.

    "abstract": "In the Directed Steiner Network problem, the input is a directed graph G, a subset T of k vertices of G called the terminals, and a demand graph D on T. The task is to find a subgraph H of G with the minimum number of edges such that for every edge (s,t) in D, the solution H contains a directed s to t path. In this paper we investigate how the complexity of the problem depends on the demand pattern when G is planar. Formally, if \\mathcal{D} is a class of directed graphs closed under identification of vertices, then the \\mathcal{D}-Steiner Network (\\mathcal{D}-SN) problem is the special case where the demand graph D is restricted to be from \\mathcal{D}. For general graphs, Feldmann and Marx [ICALP 2016] characterized those families of demand graphs where the problem is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) parameterized by the number k of terminals. They showed that if \\mathcal{D} is a superset of one of the five hard families, then \\mathcal{D}-SN is W[1]-hard parameterized by k, otherwise it can be solved in time f(k)n^{O(1)}. For planar graphs an interesting question is whether the W[1]-hard cases can be solved by subexponential parameterized algorithms. Chitnis et al. [SICOMP 2020] showed that, assuming the ETH, there is no f(k)n^{o(k)} time algorithm for the general \\mathcal{D}-SN problem on planar graphs, but the special case called Strongly Connected Steiner Subgraph can be solved in time f(k) n^{O(\\sqrt{k})} on planar graphs. We present a far-reaching generalization and unification of these two results: we give a complete characterization of the behavior of every $\\mathcal{D}$-SN problem on planar graphs. We show that assuming ETH, either the problem is (1) solvable in time 2^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}, and not in time 2^{o(k)}n^{O(1)}, or (2) solvable in time f(k)n^{O(\\sqrt{k})}, but not in time f(k)n^{o(\\sqrt{k})}, or (3) solvable in time f(k)n^{O(k)}, but not in time f(k)n^{o({k})}.

    "abstract": "Context: Mutation Testing (MT) is an important tool in traditional Software Engineering (SE) white-box testing. It aims to artificially inject faults in a system to evaluate a test suite's capability to detect them, assuming that the test suite defects finding capability will then translate to real faults. If MT has long been used in SE, it is only recently that it started gaining the attention of the Deep Learning (DL) community, with researchers adapting it to improve the testability of DL models and improve the trustworthiness of DL systems. Objective: If several techniques have been proposed for MT, most of them neglected the stochasticity inherent to DL resulting from the training phase. Even the latest MT approaches in DL, which propose to tackle MT through a statistical approach, might give inconsistent results. Indeed, as their statistic is based on a fixed set of sampled training instances, it can lead to different results across instances set when results should be consistent for any instance. Methods: In this work, we propose a Probabilistic Mutation Testing (PMT) approach that alleviates the inconsistency problem and allows for a more consistent decision on whether a mutant is killed or not. Results: We show that PMT effectively allows a more consistent and informed decision on mutations through evaluation using three models and eight mutation operators used in previously proposed MT methods. We also analyze the trade-off between the approximation error and the cost of our method, showing that relatively small error can be achieved for a manageable cost. Conclusion: Our results showed the limitation of current MT practices in DNN and the need to rethink them. We believe PMT is the first step in that direction which effectively removes the lack of consistency across test executions of previous methods caused by the stochasticity of DNN training. ",

Rather than deriving the kernels for certain limiting cases of neural networks, we learn the kernels of the Gaussian process empirically from the naturalistic behavior of neural networks. We first evaluate our approach with two case studies inspired by previous theoretical studies of neural network behavior in which we capture neural network preferences for learning low frequencies and identify pathological behavior in deep neural networks. In two further practical case studies, we use the learned kernel to predict the generalization properties of neural networks. ",

We apply this decomposition to tensor ring and tree tensor network models trained on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, and find that up to 75% of interaction degrees are contributing meaningfully to these models. We also introduce a new type of tensor network model that is explicitly trained on only a small subset of interaction degrees, and find that these models are able to match or even outperform the full models using only a fraction of the exponential feature space. This suggests that standard tensor network models utilize their polynomial regressors in an inefficient manner, with the lower degree terms being vastly under-utilized. ",

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) helps organize agents' behaviors and actions based on their state and represents complex strategies (composition of actions). This paper proposes a novel hierarchical strategy decomposition approach based on Bayesian chaining to separate an intricate policy into several simple sub-policies and organize their relationships as Bayesian strategy networks (BSN). We integrate this approach into the state-of-the-art DRL method, soft actor-critic (SAC), and build the corresponding Bayesian soft actor-critic (BSAC) model by organizing several sub-policies as a joint policy. We compare the proposed BSAC method with the SAC and other state-of-the-art approaches such as TD3, DDPG, and PPO on the standard continuous control benchmarks -- Hopper-v2, Walker2d-v2, and Humanoid-v2 -- in MuJoCo with the OpenAI Gym environment. The results demonstrate that the promising potential of the BSAC method significantly improves training efficiency.

    "abstract": "Much of software-engineering research relies on the naturalness of code, the fact that code, in small code snippets, is repetitive and can be predicted using statistical language models like n-gram. Although powerful, training such models on large code corpus is tedious, time-consuming and sensitive to code patterns (and practices) encountered during training. Consequently, these models are often trained on a small corpora and estimate the language naturalness that is relative to a specific style of programming or type of project. To overcome these issues, we propose using pre-trained language models to infer code naturalness. Pre-trained models are often built on big data, are easy to use in an out-of-the-box way and include powerful learning associations mechanisms. Our key idea is to quantify code naturalness through its predictability, by using state-of-the-art generative pre-trained language models. To this end, we infer naturalness by masking (omitting) code tokens, one at a time, of code-sequences, and checking the models' ability to predict them. To this end, we evaluate three different predictability metrics; a) measuring the number of exact matches of the predictions, b) computing the embedding similarity between the original and predicted code, i.e., similarity at the vector space, and c) computing the confidence of the model when doing the token completion task irrespective of the outcome. We implement this workflow, named CodeBERT-nt, and evaluate its capability to prioritize buggy lines over non-buggy ones when ranking code based on its naturalness. Our results, on 2510 buggy versions of 40 projects from the SmartShark dataset, show that CodeBERT-nt outperforms both, random-uniform and complexity-based ranking techniques, and yields comparable results (slightly better) than the n-gram models.

Their superb model qualities heavily depend on the excessively large labeled image datasets. In order to reduce the reliance on large labeled datasets, reconstruction based masked autoencoders are gaining popularity, which learn high quality transferable representations from unlabeled images. For the same purpose, recent weakly supervised image pretraining methods explore language supervision from text captions accompanying the images. In this work, we propose masked image pretraining on language assisted representation, dubbed as MILAN. Instead of predicting raw pixels or low level features, our pretraining objective is to reconstruct the image features with substantial semantic signals that are obtained using caption supervision. Moreover, to accommodate our reconstruction target, we propose a more efficient prompting decoder architecture and a semantic aware mask sampling mechanism, which further advance the transfer performance of the pretrained model. Experimental results demonstrate that MILAN delivers higher accuracy than the previous works. When the masked autoencoder is pretrained and finetuned on ImageNet-1K dataset with an input resolution of 224x224, MILAN achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.4% on ViTB/16, surpassing previous state-of-the-arts by 1%. In the downstream semantic segmentation task, MILAN achieves 52.7 mIoU using ViT-B/16 backbone on ADE20K dataset, outperforming previous masked pretraining results by 4 points. ",

Current robotic sampling methods seek to gather information about an observable spatial field. However, many applications, such as environmental monitoring and precision agriculture, involve phenomena that are not directly observable or are costly to measure, called latent phenomena. In our approach, we seek to reason about the latent phenomenon in real-time by effectively sampling the observable spatial fields using a team of robots with heterogeneous sensors, where each robot has a distinct sensor to measure a different observable field. The information gain is estimated using a learned model that maps from the observable spatial fields to the latent phenomenon. This model captures aleatoric uncertainty in the relationship to allow for information theoretic measures. Additionally, we explicitly consider the correlations among the observable spatial fields, capturing the relationship between sensor types whose observations are not independent. We show it is possible to learn these correlations, and investigate the impact of the learned correlation models on the performance of our sampling approach. Through our qualitative and quantitative results, we illustrate that empirically learned correlations improve the overall sampling efficiency of the team. We simulate our approach using a data set of sensor measurements collected on Lac Hertel, in Quebec, which we make publicly available. ",

To mitigate this issue, a low-complexity algorithm via the two-timescale transmission protocol is proposed in this paper, where the joint beamforming at BSs and RISs is facilitated via alternating optimization framework to maximize the average weighted sum-rate. Specifically, the passive beamformers at RISs are optimized through the statistical CSI, and the transmit beamformers at BSs are based on the instantaneous CSI of effective channels. In this manner, a closed-form expression for the achievable weighted sum-rate is derived, which enables the evaluation of the impact of key parameters on system performance. To gain more insights, a special case without line-of-sight (LoS) components is further investigated, where a power gain on the order of $\\mathcal{O}(M)$ is achieved, with $M$ being the BS antennas number. Numerical results validate the tightness of our derived analytical expression and show the fast convergence of the proposed algorithm. Findings illustrate that the performance of the proposed algorithm with two-timescale CSI is comparable to that with instantaneous CSI in low or moderate SNR regime. The impact of key system parameters such as the number of RIS elements, CSI settings and Rician factor is also evaluated. Moreover, the remarkable advantages from the adoption of the cell-free paradigm and the deployment of RISs are demonstrated intuitively. ",

    "abstract": "As the next-generation Internet paradigm, Web 3.0 encapsulates the expectations of user-centric immersion and interaction experiences in a decentralized manner. Metaverse, a virtual world interacting with the physical world, is becoming one of the most potential technology to push forward with Web 3.0. In the Metaverse, users expect to tailor immersive and interactive experiences by customizing real-time Metaverse services (e.g., augmented/virtual reality and digital twin) in the three-dimensional virtual world. Nevertheless, there are still no unified solutions for the Metaverse services in terms of management and orchestration. It is calling for a continuous evolution of scalable solutions and mobile systems to support Metaverse services, and thus bring Metaverse into reality. In this paper, to provide scalable subscription solutions for Metaverse services, we propose a new concept, named Metaverse-as-a-Service (MaaS), in which various physical-virtual components and technologies in the Metaverse can be delivered as services. Furthermore, to unify the management and orchestration of MaaS, we propose a novel framework, called Slicing4Meta, to customize Metaverse services by intelligently integrating MaaS models and the associated multi-dimensional resources on the components and technologies. Additionally, we propose the classification for typical Metaverse services based on the quality of experience (QoE) requirements and illustrate how to fulfill the QoE requirements under the Slicing4Meta framework. We then illustrate a virtual traveling study case, in which we examine the relationship between the QoE and the multi-dimensional resources by quantitatively modeling the QoE of Metaverse users. Finally, we discuss some open challenges of Slicing4Meta and propose potential solutions to address the challenges. ",

Due to the problem of data isolation and the requirement for high model performance, how to jointly build practical and secure K-means for multiple parties has become an important topic for many applications in the industry. Existing work on this is mainly of two types. The first type has efficiency advantages, but information leakage raises potential privacy risks. The second type is provable secure but is inefficient and even helpless for the large-scale data sparsity scenario. In this paper, we propose a new framework for efficient sparsity-aware K-means with three characteristics. First, our framework is divided into a data-independent offline phase and a much faster online phase, and the offline phase allows to pre-compute almost all cryptographic operations. Second, we take advantage of the vectorization techniques in both online and offline phases. Third, we adopt a sparse matrix multiplication for the data sparsity scenario to improve efficiency further. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three synthetic datasets and deploy our model in a real-world fraud detection task. Our experimental results show that, compared with the state-of-the-art solution, our model achieves competitive performance in terms of both running time and communication size, especially on sparse datasets.

However, HMC and NUTS can require numerous numerical gradients of the target density, and can prove slow in practice. We propose Hamiltonian neural networks (HNNs) with HMC and NUTS for solving Bayesian inference problems. Once trained, HNNs do not require numerical gradients of the target density during sampling. Moreover, they satisfy important properties such as perfect time reversibility and Hamiltonian conservation, making them well-suited for use within HMC and NUTS because stationarity can be shown. We also propose an HNN extension called latent HNNs (L-HNNs), which are capable of predicting latent variable outputs. Compared to HNNs, L-HNNs offer improved expressivity and reduced integration errors. Finally, we employ L-HNNs in NUTS with an online error monitoring scheme to prevent sample degeneracy in regions of low probability density. We demonstrate L-HNNs in NUTS with online error monitoring on several examples involving complex, heavy-tailed, and high-local-curvature probability densities. Overall, L-HNNs in NUTS with online error monitoring satisfactorily inferred these probability densities. Compared to traditional NUTS, L-HNNs in NUTS with online error monitoring required 1--2 orders of magnitude fewer numerical gradients of the target density and improved the effective sample size (ESS) per gradient by an order of magnitude.

To tackle this challenge, this work proposes a Multiplex Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (MHGCN) for heterogeneous network embedding. Our MHGCN can automatically learn the useful heterogeneous meta-path interactions of different lengths in multiplex heterogeneous networks through multi-layer convolution aggregation. Additionally, we effectively integrate both multi-relation structural signals and attribute semantics into the learned node embeddings with both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning paradigms.

As a fundamental task in analyzing heterogeneous graphs, relevance measure aims to calculate the relevance between two objects of different types, which has been used in many applications such as web search, recommendation, and community detection. Most of existing relevance measures focus on homogeneous networks where objects are of the same type, and a few measures are developed for heterogeneous graphs, but they often need the pre-defined meta-path. Defining meaningful meta-paths requires much domain knowledge, which largely limits their applications, especially on schema-rich heterogeneous graphs like knowledge graphs. Recently, the Graph Neural Network (GNN) has been widely applied in many graph mining tasks, but it has not been applied for measuring relevance yet. To address the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel GNN-based relevance measure, namely GSim. Specifically, we first theoretically analyze and show that GNN is effective for measuring the relevance of nodes in the graph. We then propose a context path-based graph neural network (CP-GNN) to automatically leverage the semantics in heterogeneous graphs. Moreover, we exploit CP-GNN to support relevance measures between two objects of any type. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GSim outperforms existing measures. ",

This paper describes a new software application to detect traffic incidents and exchange information about them, using only smartphones, without any central authority or additional equipment. Both road safety and communication security have been taken into account in the application design. On the one hand, the interface has been designed to avoid distractions while driving because it operates automatically and independently of the driver, through voice prompts. On the other hand, communication security, which is essential in critical wireless networks, is provided through the protection of attributes such as authenticity, privacy, integrity and non-repudiation. All this is achieved without increasing the price of vehicles and without requiring the integration of new devices neither in vehicles nor on roads. The only prerequisite is to have a smartphone equipped with Wi-Fi connectivity and GPS location in each vehicle.

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a novel framework of decentralized machine learning. Due to the decentralized feature of FL, it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks in the training procedure, e.g. , backdoor attacks. A backdoor attack aims to inject a backdoor into the machine learning model such that the model will make arbitrarily incorrect behavior on the test sample with some specific backdoor trigger. Even though a range of backdoor attack methods of FL has been introduced, there are also methods defending against them. Many of the defending methods utilize the abnormal characteristics of the models with backdoor or the difference between the models with backdoor and the regular models. To bypass these defenses, we need to reduce the difference and the abnormal characteristics. We find a source of such abnormality is that backdoor attack would directly flip the label of data when poisoning the data. However, current studies of the backdoor attack in FL are not mainly focus on reducing the difference between the models with backdoor and the regular models. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Knowledge Distillation(ADVKD), a method combine knowledge distillation with backdoor attack in FL. With knowledge distillation, we can reduce the abnormal characteristics in model result from the label flipping, thus the model can bypass the defenses. Compared to current methods, we show that ADVKD can not only reach a higher attack success rate, but also successfully bypass the defenses when other methods fails. To further explore the performance of ADVKD, we test how the parameters affect the performance of ADVKD under different scenarios. According to the experiment result, we summarize how to adjust the parameter for better performance under different scenarios. We also use several methods to visualize the effect of different attack and explain the effectiveness of ADVKD. ",

Instead, we follow the key idea that it is easier to compare two poses than to estimate them. Render-and-compare approaches have been employed to that end, however, they tend to be unstable, computationally expensive, and slow for real-time applications. We propose doing category-level pose estimation by learning an alignment metric using a contrastive loss with a dynamic margin and a continuous pose-label space. For efficient inference, we use a simple real-time image retrieval scheme with a reference set of renderings projected to an embedding space. To achieve robustness to real-world conditions, we employ synthetic occlusions, bounding box perturbations, and appearance augmentations.

    "abstract": "Finding optimal bidding strategies for generation units in electricity markets would result in higher profit. However, it is a challenging problem due to the system uncertainty which is due to the unknown other generation units' strategies. Distributed optimization, where each entity or agent decides on its bid individually, has become state of the art. However, it cannot overcome the challenges of system uncertainties. Deep reinforcement learning is a promising approach to learn the optimal strategy in uncertain environments. Nevertheless, it is not able to integrate the information on the spatial system topology in the learning process. This paper proposes a distributed learning algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with a graph convolutional neural network (GCN). In fact, the proposed framework helps the agents to update their decisions by getting feedback from the environment so that it can overcome the challenges of the uncertainties. In this proposed algorithm, the state and connection between nodes are the inputs of the GCN, which can make agents aware of the structure of the system. This information on the system topology helps the agents to improve their bidding strategies and increase the profit. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on the IEEE 30-bus system under different scenarios. Also, to investigate the generalization ability of the proposed approach, we test the trained model on IEEE 39-bus system. The results show that the proposed algorithm has more generalization abilities compare to the DRL and can result in higher profit when changing the topology of the system. ",

    "title": "Causal Imitation Learning with Unobserved Confounders",
    "abstract": "One of the common ways children learn is by mimicking adults. Imitation learning focuses on learning policies with suitable performance from demonstrations generated by an expert, with an unspecified performance measure, and unobserved reward signal. Popular methods for imitation learning start by either directly mimicking the behavior policy of an expert (behavior cloning) or by learning a reward function that prioritizes observed expert trajectories (inverse reinforcement learning). However, these methods rely on the assumption that covariates used by the expert to determine her/his actions are fully observed. In this paper, we relax this assumption and study imitation learning when sensory inputs of the learner and the expert differ. First, we provide a non-parametric, graphical criterion that is complete (both necessary and sufficient) for determining the feasibility of imitation from the combinations of demonstration data and qualitative assumptions about the underlying environment, represented in the form of a causal model. We then show that when such a criterion does not hold, imitation could still be feasible by exploiting quantitative knowledge of the expert trajectories. Finally, we develop an efficient procedure for learning the imitating policy from experts' trajectories. ",

Indeed, we provide a formula called Probabilistic vAriational Causal Effect (PACE). Our formula of causal effect uses the idea of total variation of a function integrated with probability theory. PACE has a parameter $d$ determining the degree of being probabilistic. The lower values of $d$ refer to the scenarios that rare cases are important. In contrast, with the higher values of $d$, our model deals with the problems that are in nature probabilistic. Hence, instead of a single value for causal effect, we provide a causal effect vector by discretizing $d$. We also address the problem of computing counterfactuals in causal reasoning. We compare our model to the Pearl model, the mutual information model, the conditional mutual information model, and the Janzing et al. model by investigating several examples. ",

    "abstract": "\"Monkey see monkey do\" is an age-old adage, referring to na\\\"ive imitation without a deep understanding of a system's underlying mechanics. Indeed, if a demonstrator has access to information unavailable to the imitator (monkey), such as a different set of sensors, then no matter how perfectly the imitator models its perceived environment (See), attempting to reproduce the demonstrator's behavior (Do) can lead to poor outcomes. Imitation learning in the presence of a mismatch between demonstrator and imitator has been studied in the literature under the rubric of causal imitation learning (Zhang et al., 2020), but existing solutions are limited to single-stage decision-making. This paper investigates the problem of causal imitation learning in sequential settings, where the imitator must make multiple decisions per episode. We develop a graphical criterion that is necessary and sufficient for determining the feasibility of causal imitation, providing conditions when an imitator can match a demonstrator's performance despite differing capabilities. Finally, we provide an efficient algorithm for determining imitability and corroborate our theory with simulations. ",

    "abstract": "Strong AI requires the learning engine to be task non-specific and to automatically construct a dynamic hierarchy of internal features. By hierarchy, we mean, e.g., short road edges and short bush edges amount to intermediate features of landmarks; but intermediate features from tree shadows are distractors that must be disregarded by the high-level landmark concept. By dynamic, we mean the automatic selection of features while disregarding distractors is not static, but instead based on dynamic statistics (e.g. because of the instability of shadows in the context of landmark). By internal features, we mean that they are not only sensory, but also motor, so that context from motor (state) integrates with sensory inputs to become a context-based logic machine. We present why strong AI is necessary for any practical AI systems that work reliably in the real world. We then present a new generation of Developmental Networks 2 (DN-2). With many new novelties beyond DN-1, the most important novelty of DN-2 is that the inhibition area of each internal neuron is neuron-specific and dynamic. This enables DN-2 to automatically construct an internal hierarchy that is fluid, whose number of areas is not static as in DN-1. To optimally use the limited resource available, we establish that DN-2 is optimal in terms of maximum likelihood, under the condition of limited learning experience and limited resources. We also present how DN-2 can learn an emergent Universal Turing Machine (UTM). Together with the optimality, we present the optimal UTM. Experiments for real-world vision-based navigation, maze planning, and audition used DN-2. They successfully showed that DN-2 is for general purposes using natural and synthetic inputs. Their automatically constructed internal representation focuses on important features while being invariant to distractors and other irrelevant context-concepts. ",

    "abstract": "Segmenting dental plaque from images of medical reagent staining provides valuable information for diagnosis and the determination of follow-up treatment plan. However, accurate dental plaque segmentation is a challenging task that requires identifying teeth and dental plaque subjected to semantic-blur regions (i.e., confused boundaries in border regions between teeth and dental plaque) and complex variations of instance shapes, which are not fully addressed by existing methods. Therefore, we propose a semantic decomposition network (SDNet) that introduces two single-task branches to separately address the segmentation of teeth and dental plaque and designs additional constraints to learn category-specific features for each branch, thus facilitating the semantic decomposition and improving the performance of dental plaque segmentation. Specifically, SDNet learns two separate segmentation branches for teeth and dental plaque in a divide-and-conquer manner to decouple the entangled relation between them. Each branch that specifies a category tends to yield accurate segmentation. To help these two branches better focus on category-specific features, two constraint modules are further proposed: 1) contrastive constraint module (CCM) to learn discriminative feature representations by maximizing the distance between different category representations, so as to reduce the negative impact of semantic-blur regions on feature extraction; 2) structural constraint module (SCM) to provide complete structural information for dental plaque of various shapes by the supervision of an boundary-aware geometric constraint. Besides, we construct a large-scale open-source Stained Dental Plaque Segmentation dataset (SDPSeg), which provides high-quality annotations for teeth and dental plaque. Experimental results on SDPSeg datasets show SDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. ",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances in autonomous driving systems, accidents such as the fatal Uber crash in 2018 show these systems are still susceptible to edge cases. Such systems must be thoroughly tested and validated before being deployed in the real world to avoid such events. Testing in open-world scenarios can be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. These challenges can be addressed by using driving simulators such as CARLA instead. A key part of such tests is adversarial testing, in which the goal is to find scenarios that lead to failures of the given system. While several independent efforts in testing have been made, a well-established testing framework that enables adversarial testing has yet to be made available for CARLA. We therefore propose ANTI-CARLA, an automated testing framework in CARLA for simulating adversarial weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain) and sensor faults (e.g., camera occlusion) that fail the system. The operating conditions in which a given system should be tested are specified in a scenario description language. The framework offers an efficient search mechanism that searches for adversarial operating conditions that will fail the tested system. In this way, ANTI-CARLA extends the CARLA simulator with the capability of performing adversarial testing on any given driving pipeline. We use ANTI-CARLA to test the driving pipeline trained with Learning By Cheating (LBC) approach. The simulation results demonstrate that ANTI-CARLA can effectively and automatically find a range of failure cases despite LBC reaching an accuracy of 100% in the CARLA benchmark. ",

Factor graph solvers exploit the locality of problems to drastically reduce the computational time of the Iterative Least-Squares (ILS) methodology. Although extremely powerful, their application is usually limited to unconstrained problems. In this paper, we model constraints over variables within factor graphs by introducing a factor graph version of the method of Lagrange Multipliers. We show the potential of our method by presenting a full navigation stack based on factor graphs. Differently from standard navigation stacks, we can model both optimal control for local planning and localization with factor graphs, and solve the two problems using the standard ILS methodology. We validate our approach in real-world autonomous navigation scenarios, comparing it with the de facto standard navigation stack implemented in ROS. Comparative experiments show that for the application at hand our system outperforms the standard nonlinear programming solver Interior-Point Optimizer (IPOPT) in runtime, while achieving similar solutions.

Implicit neural scene representation with a radiance field can reconstruct the 3D shape of a scene continuously within a limited spatial area. However, training a fully implicit representation on commercial PC hardware requires a lot of time and computing resources (15 $\\sim$ 20 hours per scene). Therefore, we propose a method to accelerate this process significantly (20 $\\sim$ 40 minutes per scene). Instead of using a fully implicit representation of rays for radiance field reconstruction, we adopt feature voxels that contain density and color features in tensors. Considering omnidirectional equirectangular input and the camera layout, we use spherical voxelization for representation instead of cubic representation. Our voxelization method could balance the reconstruction quality of the inner scene and outer scene. In addition, we adopt the axis-aligned positional encoding method on the color features to increase the total image quality. Our method achieves satisfying empirical performance on synthetic datasets with random camera poses. Moreover, we test our method with real scenes which contain complex geometries and also achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our code and complete dataset will be released at the same time as the paper publication. ",

    "abstract": "Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) are highly promising devices for the construction of neuromorphic photonic information processing systems, due to their numerous desirable properties such as low power consumption, high modulation speed, compactness, and ease of manufacturing. Of particular interest is the ability of VCSELs to exhibit neural-like spiking responses, much like biological neurons, but at ultrafast sub-nanosecond rates; thus offering great prospects for high-speed light-enabled neuromorphic (spike-based) processors. Recent works have shown the use the spiking dynamics in VCSELs for pattern recognition and image processing problems such as image data encoding and edge-feature detection. Additionally, VCSELs have also been used recently as nonlinear elements in photonic reservoir computing (RC) implementations, yielding excellent state of the art operation. This work introduces and experimentally demonstrates for the first time the new concept of a Ghz-rate photonic spiking neural network (SNN) built with a single VCSEL neuron. The reported system effectively implements a photonic VCSEL-based spiking reservoir computer, and demonstrates its successful application to a complex nonlinear classification task. Importantly, the proposed system benefits from a highly hardware-friendly, inexpensive realization (built with a single VCSEL and off-the-shelf fibre-optic components), for high-speed (GHz-rate inputs) and low-power (sub-mW optical input power) photonic operation. These results open new pathways towards future neuromorphic photonic spike-based information processing systems based upon VCSELs (or other laser types) for novel ultrafast machine learning and AI hardware.

    "abstract": "Embedding learning is an important technique in deep recommendation models to map categorical features to dense vectors. However, the embedding tables often demand an extremely large number of parameters, which become the storage and efficiency bottlenecks. Distributed training solutions have been adopted to partition the embedding tables into multiple devices. However, the embedding tables can easily lead to imbalances if not carefully partitioned. This is a significant design challenge of distributed systems named embedding table sharding, i.e., how we should partition the embedding tables to balance the costs across devices, which is a non-trivial task because 1) it is hard to efficiently and precisely measure the cost, and 2) the partition problem is known to be NP-hard. In this work, we introduce our novel practice in Meta, namely AutoShard, which uses a neural cost model to directly predict the multi-table costs and leverages deep reinforcement learning to solve the partition problem. Experimental results on an open-sourced large-scale synthetic dataset and Meta's production dataset demonstrate the superiority of AutoShard over the heuristics. Moreover, the learned policy of AutoShard can transfer to sharding tasks with various numbers of tables and different ratios of the unseen tables without any fine-tuning. Furthermore, AutoShard can efficiently shard hundreds of tables in seconds. The effectiveness, transferability, and efficiency of AutoShard make it desirable for production use.

Uncertainty estimation is an efficient solution to this problem, as it provides a measure of confidence in the segmentation results. The current uncertainty estimation methods based on quantile regression, Bayesian neural network, ensemble, and Monte Carlo dropout are limited by their high computational cost and inconsistency. In order to overcome these challenges, Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) was developed in recent work but primarily for natural image classification. In this paper, we proposed a region-based EDL segmentation framework that can generate reliable uncertainty maps and robust segmentation results. We used the Theory of Evidence to interpret the output of a neural network as evidence values gathered from input features. Following Subjective Logic, evidence was parameterized as a Dirichlet distribution, and predicted probabilities were treated as subjective opinions. To evaluate the performance of our model on segmentation and uncertainty estimation, we conducted quantitative and qualitative experiments on the BraTS 2020 dataset. The results demonstrated the top performance of the proposed method in quantifying segmentation uncertainty and robustly segmenting tumors. Furthermore, our proposed new framework maintained the advantages of low computational cost and easy implementation and showed the potential for clinical application. ",

Existing deep-learning-based methods encounter several key issues: 1) incomplete context for Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs) generation; 2) incapable of capturing the entire 3D geometry of the input structure; 3) inefficient prediction of the CDR sequences in an autoregressive manner. In this paper, we propose Multi-channel Equivariant Attention Network (MEAN), an end-to-end model that is able to co-design 1D sequences and 3D structures of CDRs. To be specific, MEAN formulates antibody design as a conditional graph translation problem by importing extra components including the target antigen and the light chain of the antibody. Then, MEAN resorts to E(3)-equivariant message passing along with a proposed attention mechanism to better capture the geometrical correlation between different components. Finally, it outputs both the 1D sequences and 3D structure via a multi-round progressive full-shot scheme, which enjoys more efficiency against previous autoregressive approaches. Our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art models in sequence and structure modeling, antigen-binding antibody design, and binding affinity optimization. Specifically, the relative improvement to baselines is about 22% in antigen-binding CDR design and 34% for affinity optimization. ",

    "abstract": "Brain network analysis for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is critical for its consciousness level assessment and prognosis evaluation, which requires the segmentation of certain consciousness-related brain regions. However, it is difficult to construct a TBI segmentation model as manually annotated MR scans of TBI patients are hard to collect. Data augmentation techniques can be applied to alleviate the issue of data scarcity. However, conventional data augmentation strategies such as spatial and intensity transformation are unable to mimic the deformation and lesions in traumatic brains, which limits the performance of the subsequent segmentation task. To address these issues, we propose a novel medical image inpainting model named TBI-GAN to synthesize TBI MR scans with paired brain label maps. The main strength of our TBI-GAN method is that it can generate TBI images and corresponding label maps simultaneously, which has not been achieved in the previous inpainting methods for medical images. We first generate the inpainted image under the guidance of edge information following a coarse-to-fine manner, and then the synthesized intensity image is used as the prior for label inpainting. Furthermore, we introduce a registration-based template augmentation pipeline to increase the diversity of the synthesized image pairs and enhance the capacity of data augmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed TBI-GAN method can produce sufficient synthesized TBI images with high quality and valid label maps, which can greatly improve the 2D and 3D traumatic brain segmentation performance compared with the alternatives.

    "abstract": "The wide application of deep neural networks (DNNs) demands an increasing amount of attention to their real-world robustness, i.e., whether a DNN resists black-box adversarial attacks, among them score-based query attacks (SQAs) are the most threatening ones because of their practicalities and effectiveness: the attackers only need dozens of queries on model outputs to seriously hurt a victim network. Defending against SQAs requires a slight but artful variation of outputs due to the service purpose for users, who share the same output information with attackers. In this paper, we propose a real-world defense, called Unifying Gradients (UniG), to unify gradients of different data so that attackers could only probe a much weaker attack direction that is similar for different samples. Since such universal attack perturbations have been validated as less aggressive than the input-specific perturbations, UniG protects real-world DNNs by indicating attackers a twisted and less informative attack direction. To enhance UniG's practical significance in real-world applications, we implement it as a Hadamard product module that is computationally-efficient and readily plugged into any model. According to extensive experiments on 5 SQAs and 4 defense baselines, UniG significantly improves real-world robustness without hurting clean accuracy on CIFAR10 and ImageNet. For instance, UniG maintains a CIFAR-10 model of 77.80% accuracy under 2500-query Square attack while the state-of-the-art adversarially-trained model only has 67.34% on CIFAR10. Simultaneously, UniG greatly surpasses all compared baselines in clean accuracy and the modification degree of outputs. The code would be released. ",

    "abstract": "Contrastive representation learning seeks to acquire useful representations by estimating the shared information between multiple views of data. Here, the choice of data augmentation is sensitive to the quality of learned representations: as harder the data augmentations are applied, the views share more task-relevant information, but also task-irrelevant one that can hinder the generalization capability of representation. Motivated by this, we present a new robust contrastive learning scheme, coined R\\'enyiCL, which can effectively manage harder augmentations by utilizing R\\'enyi divergence. Our method is built upon the variational lower bound of R\\'enyi divergence, but a na\\\"ive usage of a variational method is impractical due to the large variance. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel contrastive objective that conducts variational estimation of a skew R\\'enyi divergence and provide a theoretical guarantee on how variational estimation of skew divergence leads to stable training. We show that R\\'enyi contrastive learning objectives perform innate hard negative sampling and easy positive sampling simultaneously so that it can selectively learn useful features and ignore nuisance features. Through experiments on ImageNet, we show that R\\'enyi contrastive learning with stronger augmentations outperforms other self-supervised methods without extra regularization or computational overhead. Moreover, we also validate our method on other domains such as graph and tabular, showing empirical gain over other contrastive methods. ",

    "abstract": "With the advent of connected autonomous vehicles, we are expecting to witness a new era of unprecedented user experiences, improved road safety, a wide range of compelling transportation applications, etc. A large number of disruptive communication technologies are emerging for the sixth generation (6G) wireless network aiming to support advanced use cases for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). An example of such a disruptive technology is constituted by hybrid Visible Light Communication (VLC) and Radio Frequency (RF) systems, which can play a major role in advanced ITS. Hence we outline the potential benefits of hybrid vehicular-VLC (V-VLC) and vehicular-RF (V-RF) communication systems over standalone V-VLC and standalone V-RF systems. In particular, we show that the link-aggregated hybrid V-VLC/V-RF system is capable of meeting stringent ultra high reliability (~99.999%) and ultra-low latency (<3 ms) specifications, making it a promising candidate for 6G ITS. To stimulate future research in the hybrid RF-VLC V2X area, we also highlight the potential challenges and research directions. ",

The literature has focused on the proposals of over-smoothing and under-reaching to explain the performance deterioration of deep GNNs. In this paper, we propose a new explanation for such deteriorated performance phenomenon, mis-simplification, that is, mistakenly simplifying graphs by preventing self-loops and forcing edges to be unweighted. We show that such simplifying can reduce the potential of message-passing layers to capture the structural information of graphs. In view of this, we propose a new framework, edge enhanced graph neural network(EEGNN). EEGNN uses the structural information extracted from the proposed Dirichlet mixture Poisson graph model, a Bayesian nonparametric model for graphs, to improve the performance of various deep message-passing GNNs. Experiments over different datasets show that our method achieves considerable performance increase compared to baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Background and Purpose: Convolutional neural network is widely used for image recognition in the medical area at nowadays. However, overall accuracy in predicting lung tumor is low and the processing time is high as the error occurred while reconstructing the CT image. The aim of this work is to increase the overall prediction accuracy along with reducing processing time by using multispace image in pooling layer of convolution neural network. Methodology: The proposed method has the autoencoder system to improve the overall accuracy, and to predict lung cancer by using multispace image in pooling layer of convolution neural network and Adam Algorithm for optimization. First, the CT images were pre-processed by feeding image to the convolution filter and down sampled by using max pooling. Then, features are extracted using the autoencoder model based on convolutional neural network and multispace image reconstruction technique is used to reduce error while reconstructing the image which then results improved accuracy to predict lung nodule. Finally, the reconstructed images are taken as input for SoftMax classifier to classify the CT images. Results: The state-of-art and proposed solutions were processed in Python Tensor Flow and It provides significant increase in accuracy in classification of lung cancer to 99.5 from 98.9 and decrease in processing time from 10 frames/second to 12 seconds/second. Conclusion: The proposed solution provides high classification accuracy along with less processing time compared to the state of art. For future research, large dataset can be implemented, and low pixel image can be processed to evaluate the classification ",

Here, we present a communication network model of the immune system to compute the information transferred by the viral proteins using the available SARS-CoV-2 PPIs data. The amount of transferred information depends on the reference state of the immune system, or the state without SARS-CoV-2 PPIs, and can quantify how many variables of the immune system are controlled by the viral proteins. The information received by the immune system proteins from the viral proteins is useful to identify the biological processes (BPs) susceptible to dysregulation, and also to estimate the duration of viral PPIs necessary for the dysregulation to occur. We found that computing the drop in information from viral PPIs due to drugs provides a direct measure for the efficacy of therapies. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a method that learns the data representation by utilizing supervision inherent in the data. This learning method is in the spotlight in the drug field, lacking annotated data due to time-consuming and expensive experiments. SSL using enormous unlabeled data has shown excellent performance for molecular property prediction, but a few issues exist. (1) Existing SSL models are large-scale; there is a limitation to implementing SSL where the computing resource is insufficient. (2) In most cases, they do not utilize 3D structural information for molecular representation learning. The activity of a drug is closely related to the structure of the drug molecule. Nevertheless, most current models do not use 3D information or use it partially. (3) Previous models that apply contrastive learning to molecules use the augmentation of permuting atoms and bonds. Therefore, molecules having different characteristics can be in the same positive samples. We propose a novel contrastive learning framework, small-scale 3D Graph Contrastive Learning (3DGCL) for molecular property prediction, to solve the above problems. 3DGCL learns the molecular representation by reflecting the molecule's structure through the pre-training process that does not change the semantics of the drug. Using only 1,128 samples for pre-train data and 1 million model parameters, we achieved the state-of-the-art or comparable performance in four regression benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3D structural information based on chemical knowledge is essential to molecular representation learning for property prediction. ",

A drug hierarchy is a valuable source that encodes knowledge of relations among drugs in a tree-like structure where drugs that act on the same organs, treat the same disease, or bind to the same biological target are grouped together. However, its utility in learning drug representations has not yet been explored, and currently described drug representations cannot place novel molecules in a drug hierarchy. Here, we develop a semi-supervised drug embedding that incorporates two sources of information: (1) underlying chemical grammar that is inferred from chemical structures of drugs and drug-like molecules (unsupervised), and (2) hierarchical relations that are encoded in an expert-crafted hierarchy of approved drugs (supervised). We use the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) framework to encode the chemical structures of molecules and use the drug-drug similarity information obtained from the hierarchy to induce the clustering of drugs in hyperbolic space. The hyperbolic space is amenable for encoding hierarchical relations. Our qualitative results support that the learned drug embedding can induce the hierarchical relations among drugs. We demonstrate that the learned drug embedding can be used for drug repositioning. ",

These rapid advancements necessitate new models and analyses to keep up with the various emergent phenomena they induce. A major prerequisite of such work is the acquisition of well-constructed and accurate network datasets for the power grid infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a robust, scalable framework to synthesize power distribution networks which resemble their physical counterparts for a given region. We use openly available information about interdependent road and building infrastructures to construct the networks. In contrast to prior work based on network statistics, we incorporate engineering and economic constraints to create the networks. Additionally, we provide a framework to create ensembles of power distribution networks to generate multiple possible instances of the network for a given region. The comprehensive dataset consists of nodes with attributes such as geo-coordinates, type of node (residence, transformer, or substation), and edges with attributes such as geometry, type of line (feeder lines, primary or secondary) and line parameters. For validation, we provide detailed comparisons of the generated networks with actual distribution networks. The generated datasets represent realistic test systems (as compared to standard IEEE test cases) that can be used by network scientists to analyze complex events in power grids and to perform detailed sensitivity and statistical analyses over ensembles of networks.
