    "abstract": "Sharing experimental data and making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) are of growing importance to funders, publishers, and to scientists themselves. Evaluating whether datasets are FAIR is challenging because the FAIR Guiding Principles include highly idiosyncratic criteria regarding the metadata used to annotate datasets -- such as whether metadata are \"rich\" and whether they adhere to \"domain-relevant\" community standards. Rather than attempting to assess whether the metadata comport with the FAIR principles after datasets are already archived in some repository, an alternative approach is to enable scientific communities to define their own templates for metadata that necessarily encode these discipline-specific elements. Such templates, inherently, incorporate the level of \"richness\" desired by the community and the standards (both reporting guidelines and ontologies) that the community wishes to adopt. We have explored this approach in the context of two software systems that use such metadata templates. One is the CEDAR Workbench, which is used to author both metadata templates and new metadata. The other is the FAIRware Workbench, which evaluates the metadata of archived datasets for their adherence to community standards. There are benefits when templates for metadata are made to be central elements of an ecosystem of tools to manage online datasets -- both because they serve as an examinable community reference for what constitutes FAIR data, and because they embody that perspective in a machine-actionable format that can be distributed among a variety of software applications to assist with data stewardship and data sharing.

We consider structural parameterization by the leafage of classical domination and cut problems on chordal graphs. Fomin, Golovach, and Raymond [ESA 2018, Algorithmica 2020] proved, among other things, that Dominating Set on chordal graphs admits an algorithm running in time $2^{O(l^2)} n^{O(1)}$. We present a conceptually much simpler algorithm that runs in time $2^{O(l)} n^{O(1)}$. We extend our approach to obtain similar results for Connected Dominating Set and Steiner Tree. We then consider the two classical cut problems MultiCut with Undeletable Terminals and Multiway Cut with Undeletable Terminals. We prove that the former is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the leafage and complement this result by presenting a simple $n^{O(l)}$-time algorithm. To our surprise, we find that Multiway Cut with Undeletable Terminals on chordal graphs can be solved, in contrast, in $n^{O(1)}$-time. ",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViT) are competing to replace Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for various computer vision tasks in medical imaging such as classification and segmentation. While the vulnerability of CNNs to adversarial attacks is a well-known problem, recent works have shown that ViTs are also susceptible to such attacks and suffer significant performance degradation under attack. The vulnerability of ViTs to carefully engineered adversarial samples raises serious concerns about their safety in clinical settings. In this paper, we propose a novel self-ensembling method to enhance the robustness of ViT in the presence of adversarial attacks. The proposed Self-Ensembling Vision Transformer (SEViT) leverages the fact that feature representations learned by initial blocks of a ViT are relatively unaffected by adversarial perturbations. Learning multiple classifiers based on these intermediate feature representations and combining these predictions with that of the final ViT classifier can provide robustness against adversarial attacks. Measuring the consistency between the various predictions can also help detect adversarial samples. Experiments on two modalities (chest X-ray and fundoscopy) demonstrate the efficacy of SEViT architecture to defend against various adversarial attacks in the gray-box (attacker has full knowledge of the target model, but not the defense mechanism) setting.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has been recognized as one of the most promising solutions for distributed machine learning (ML). In most of the current literature, FL has been studied for supervised ML tasks, in which edge devices collect labeled data. Nevertheless, in many applications, it is impractical to assume existence of labeled data across devices. To this end, we develop a novel methodology, Cooperative Federated unsupervised Contrastive Learning (CF-CL), for FL across edge devices with unlabeled datasets. CF-CL employs local device cooperation where data are exchanged among devices through device-to-device (D2D) communications to avoid local model bias resulting from non-independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) local datasets. CF-CL introduces a push-pull smart data sharing mechanism tailored to unsupervised FL settings, in which, each device pushes a subset of its local datapoints to its neighbors as reserved data points, and pulls a set of datapoints from its neighbors, sampled through a probabilistic importance sampling technique. We demonstrate that CF-CL leads to (i) alignment of unsupervised learned latent spaces across devices, (ii) faster global convergence, allowing for less frequent global model aggregations; and (iii) is effective in extreme non-i.i.d. data settings across the devices.

    "abstract": "Process variations and device aging impose profound challenges for circuit designers. Without a precise understanding of the impact of variations on the delay of circuit paths, guardbands, which keep timing violations at bay, cannot be correctly estimated. This problem is exacerbated for advanced technology nodes, where transistor dimensions reach atomic levels and established margins are severely constrained. Hence, traditional worst-case analysis becomes impractical, resulting in intolerable performance overheads. Contrarily, process-variation/aging-aware static timing analysis (STA) equips designers with accurate statistical delay distributions. Timing guardbands that are small, yet sufficient, can then be effectively estimated. However, such analysis is costly as it requires intensive Monte-Carlo simulations. Further, it necessitates access to confidential physics-based aging models to generate the standard-cell libraries required for STA. In this work, we employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to accurately estimate the impact of process variations and device aging on the delay of any path within a circuit. Our proposed GNN4REL framework empowers designers to perform rapid and accurate reliability estimations without accessing transistor models, standard-cell libraries, or even STA; these components are all incorporated into the GNN model via training by the foundry. Specifically, GNN4REL is trained on a FinFET technology model that is calibrated against industrial 14nm measurement data. Through our extensive experiments on EPFL and ITC-99 benchmarks, as well as RISC-V processors, we successfully estimate delay degradations of all paths -- notably within seconds -- with a mean absolute error down to 0.01 percentage points.

The Map-matching method is employed as a preprocessing technique, which matches a moving object point on a corresponding road. However, most of the GPS trajectory datasets include stay-points irregularity, which makes map-matching algorithms mismatch trajectories to irrelevant streets. Therefore, determining the stay-point region in GPS trajectory datasets results in better accurate matching and more rapid approaches. In this work, we cluster stay-points in a trajectory dataset with DBSCAN and eliminate redundant data to improve the efficiency of the map-matching algorithm by lowering processing time. We reckoned our proposed method's performance and exactness with a ground truth dataset compared to a fuzzy-logic based map-matching algorithm. Fortunately, our approach yields 27.39% data size reduction and 8.9% processing time reduction with the same accurate results as the previous fuzzy-logic based map-matching approach. ",

    "abstract": "Perspective distortions and crowd variations make crowd counting a challenging task in computer vision. To tackle it, many previous works have used multi-scale architecture in deep neural networks (DNNs). Multi-scale branches can be either directly merged (e.g. by concatenation) or merged through the guidance of proxies (e.g. attentions) in the DNNs. Despite their prevalence, these combination methods are not sophisticated enough to deal with the per-pixel performance discrepancy over multi-scale density maps. In this work, we redesign the multi-scale neural network by introducing a hierarchical mixture of density experts, which hierarchically merges multi-scale density maps for crowd counting. Within the hierarchical structure, an expert competition and collaboration scheme is presented to encourage contributions from all scales; pixel-wise soft gating nets are introduced to provide pixel-wise soft weights for scale combinations in different hierarchies. The network is optimized using both the crowd density map and the local counting map, where the latter is obtained by local integration on the former. Optimizing both can be problematic because of their potential conflicts. We introduce a new relative local counting loss based on relative count differences among hard-predicted local regions in an image, which proves to be complementary to the conventional absolute error loss on the density map. Experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on five public datasets, i.e. ShanghaiTech, UCF_CC_50, JHU-CROWD++, NWPU-Crowd and Trancos. ",

Once calibrated, the stochastic model can be used to predict the roughness and porosity at part scale at a significantly reduced computational cost compared to detailed powder-scale deterministic simulations.

If we were to train a classifier directly on imbalanced data, it is more likely for the classifier to predict a new sample as one of the majority classes. In the extreme case, the classifier could completely ignore the minority classes. This could have serious sociological implications in healthcare, as the minority classes are usually the disease classes (e.g., death or positive clinical test result). In this paper, we introduce a software that uses Generative Adversarial Networks to oversample the minority classes so as to improve downstream classification.

Face and facial emotional recognition are areas where machine learning is excelling. Facial Emotion Recognition in an unconstrained environment is an open challenge for digital image processing due to different environments, such as lighting conditions, pose variation, yaw motion, and occlusions. Deep learning approaches have shown significant improvements in image recognition. However, accuracy and time still need improvements. This research aims to improve facial emotion recognition accuracy during the training session and reduce processing time using a modified Convolution Neural Network Enhanced with Extreme Learning Machine (CNNEELM). The system entails (CNNEELM) improving the accuracy in image registration during the training session. Furthermore, the system recognizes six facial emotions happy, sad, disgust, fear, surprise, and neutral with the proposed CNNEELM model. The study shows that the overall facial emotion recognition accuracy is improved by 2% than the state of art solutions with a modified Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) technique. With the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier, the processing time is brought down to 65ms from 113ms, which can smoothly classify each frame from a video clip at 20fps. With the pre-trained InceptionV3 model, the proposed CNNEELM model is trained with JAFFE, CK+, and FER2013 expression datasets. The simulation results show significant improvements in accuracy and processing time, making the model suitable for the video analysis process. Besides, the study solves the issue of the large processing time required to process the facial images. ",

Our focus here lies on natural parameter as well as parameters that measure the structural properties of the input instance. We enhance our understanding of the problem from the viewpoint of parameterized complexity by showing that (1) the problem is W[1]-hard parameterized by a wide range of fairly restrictive structural parameters such as the feedback vertex set number, treewidth, pathwidth, and treedepth of the input graph; we thereby resolve an open question stated by Bernhard Bliem and Stefan Woltran (2018) concerning the complexity of Offensive Alliance parameterized by treewidth, (2) unless ETH fails, Offensive Alliance problem cannot be solved in time $\\mathcal{O}^{*}(2^{o(k \\log k)})$ where $k$ is the solution size, (3) Offensive Alliance problem does not admit a polynomial kernel parameterized by solution size and vertex cover of the input graph.

Multiagent tasks with sparse reward feedback are especially challenging not only because of the credit distribution problem, but also due to the low probability of obtaining positive reward feedback. In this paper, we design a graph network called Cooperation Graph (CG). The Cooperation Graph is the combination of two simple bipartite graphs, namely, the Agent Clustering subgraph (ACG) and the Cluster Designating subgraph (CDG). Next, based on this novel graph structure, we propose a Cooperation Graph Multiagent Reinforcement Learning (CG-MARL) algorithm, which can efficiently deal with the sparse reward problem in multiagent tasks. In CG-MARL, agents are directly controlled by the Cooperation Graph. And a policy neural network is trained to manipulate this Cooperation Graph, guiding agents to achieve cooperation in an implicit way. This hierarchical feature of CG-MARL provides space for customized cluster-actions, an extensible interface for introducing fundamental cooperation knowledge. In experiments, CG-MARL shows state-of-the-art performance in sparse reward multiagent benchmarks, including the anti-invasion interception task and the multi-cargo delivery task. ",

This classic design paradigm inevitably leads to inconsistent spatial distributions between classification score and localization quality (IOU). Therefore, this paper alleviates this misalignment in the view of knowledge distillation. First, we observe that the massive teacher achieves a higher proportion of harmonious predictions than the lightweight student. Based on this intriguing observation, a novel Harmony Score (HS) is devised to estimate the alignment of classification and regression qualities. HS models the relationship between two sub-tasks and is seen as prior knowledge to promote harmonious predictions for the student. Second, this spatial misalignment will result in inharmonious region selection when distilling features. To alleviate this problem, a novel Task-decoupled Feature Distillation (TFD) is proposed by flexibly balancing the contributions of classification and regression tasks. Eventually, HD and TFD constitute the proposed method, named Task-Balanced Distillation (TBD). Extensive experiments demonstrate the considerable potential and generalization of the proposed method.

    "abstract": "Many commodity sensors that measure the robot and dynamic obstacle's state have non-Gaussian noise characteristics. Yet, many current approaches treat the underlying-uncertainty in motion and perception as Gaussian, primarily to ensure computational tractability. On the other hand, existing planners working with non-Gaussian uncertainty do not shed light on leveraging distributional characteristics of motion and perception noise, such as bias for efficient collision avoidance. This paper fills this gap by interpreting reactive collision avoidance as a distribution matching problem between the collision constraint violations and Dirac Delta distribution. To ensure fast reactivity in the planner, we embed each distribution in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space and reformulate the distribution matching as minimizing the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the two distributions. We show that evaluating the MMD for a given control input boils down to just matrix-matrix products. We leverage this insight to develop a simple control sampling approach for reactive collision avoidance with dynamic and uncertain obstacles. We advance the state-of-the-art in two respects. First, we conduct an extensive empirical study to show that our planner can infer distributional bias from sample-level information. Consequently, it uses this insight to guide the robot to good homotopy. We also highlight how a Gaussian approximation of the underlying uncertainty can lose the bias estimate and guide the robot to unfavorable states with a high collision probability. Second, we show tangible comparative advantages of the proposed distribution matching approach for collision avoidance with previous non-parametric and Gaussian approximated methods of reactive collision avoidance.

We propose a 3D-CNN-based action recognition model, called the blockwise temporal-spatial path-way network (BTSNet), which can adjust the temporal and spatial receptive fields by multiple pathways. We designed a novel model inspired by an adaptive kernel selection-based model, which is an architecture for effective feature encoding that adaptively chooses spatial receptive fields for image recognition. Expanding this approach to the temporal domain, our model extracts temporal and channel-wise attention and fuses information on various candidate operations. For evaluation, we tested our proposed model on UCF-101, HMDB-51, SVW, and Epic-Kitchen datasets and showed that it generalized well without pretraining. BTSNet also provides interpretable visualization based on spatiotemporal channel-wise attention. We confirm that the blockwise temporal-spatial pathway supports a better representation for 3D convolutional blocks based on this visualization. ",

The MuSe 2022 focuses on humor detection, emotional reactions and multimodal emotional stress utilising different modalities and data sets. In our work, different kinds of multimodal features are extracted, including acoustic, visual, text and biological features. These features are fused by TEMMA and GRU with self-attention mechanism frameworks. In this paper, 1) several new audio features, facial expression features and paragraph-level text embeddings are extracted for accuracy improvement. 2) we substantially improve the accuracy and reliability for multimodal sentiment prediction by mining and blending the multimodal features. 3) effective data augmentation strategies are applied in model training to alleviate the problem of sample imbalance and prevent the model form learning biased subject characters. For the MuSe-Humor sub-challenge, our model obtains the AUC score of 0.8932. For the MuSe-Reaction sub-challenge, the Pearson's Correlations Coefficient of our approach on the test set is 0.3879, which outperforms all other participants. For the MuSe-Stress sub-challenge, our approach outperforms the baseline in both arousal and valence on the test dataset, reaching a final combined result of 0.5151. ",

    "abstract": "Image restoration algorithms such as super resolution (SR) are indispensable pre-processing modules for object detection in low quality images. Most of these algorithms assume the degradation is fixed and known a priori. However, in practical, either the real degradation or optimal up-sampling ratio rate is unknown or differs from assumption, leading to a deteriorating performance for both the pre-processing module and the consequent high-level task such as object detection. Here, we propose a novel self-supervised framework to detect objects in degraded low resolution images. We utilizes the downsampling degradation as a kind of transformation for self-supervised signals to explore the equivariant representation against various resolutions and other degradation conditions. The Auto Encoding Resolution in Self-supervision (AERIS) framework could further take the advantage of advanced SR architectures with an arbitrary resolution restoring decoder to reconstruct the original correspondence from the degraded input image. Both the representation learning and object detection are optimized jointly in an end-to-end training fashion. The generic AERIS framework could be implemented on various mainstream object detection architectures with different backbones. The extensive experiments show that our methods has achieved superior performance compared with existing methods when facing variant degradation situations.

    "abstract": "Traffic forecasting is challenging due to dynamic and complicated spatial-temporal dependencies. However, existing methods still suffer from two critical limitations. Firstly, many approaches typically utilize static pre-defined or adaptively learned spatial graphs to capture dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies in the traffic system, which limits the flexibility and only captures shared patterns for the whole time, thus leading to sub-optimal performance. In addition, most approaches individually and independently consider the absolute error between ground truth and predictions at each time step, which fails to maintain the global properties and statistics of time series as a whole and results in trend discrepancy between ground truth and predictions. To this end, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Adaptive and Adversarial Graph Convolutional Network (DAAGCN), which combines Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, DAAGCN leverages a universal paradigm with a gate module to integrate time-varying embeddings with node embeddings to generate dynamic adaptive graphs for inferring spatial-temporal dependencies at each time step. Then, two discriminators are designed to maintain the consistency of the global properties and statistics of predicted time series with ground truth at the sequence and graph levels. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets manifest that DAAGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art by average 5.05%, 3.80%, and 5.27%, in terms of MAE, RMSE, and MAPE, meanwhile, speeds up convergence up to 9 times.

Even though GNN explanation is crucial to increase user trust in the systems, it is challenging due to the complexity of GNN execution. Lately, many works have been proposed to address some of the issues in GNN explanation. However, they lack generalization capability or suffer from computational burden when the size of graphs is enormous. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-level GNN explanation framework based on an observation that GNN is a multimodal learning process of multiple components in graph data. The complexity of the original problem is relaxed by breaking into multiple sub-parts represented as a hierarchical structure. The top-level explanation aims at specifying the contribution of each component to the model execution and predictions, while fine-grained levels focus on feature attribution and graph structure attribution analysis based on knowledge distillation. Student models are trained in standalone modes and are responsible for capturing different teacher behaviors, later used for particular component interpretation. Besides, we also aim for personalized explanations as the framework can generate different results based on user preferences. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and fidelity of our proposed approach. ",

In recent years, numerous sound and complete verification methods have been proposed towards that end, but these typically suffer from severe scalability limitations. Recent work has proposed enhancing such verification techniques with abstraction-refinement capabilities, which have been shown to boost scalability: instead of verifying a large and complex network, the verifier constructs and then verifies a much smaller network, whose correctness implies the correctness of the original network. A shortcoming of such a scheme is that if verifying the smaller network fails, the verifier needs to perform a refinement step that increases the size of the network being verified, and then start verifying the new network from scratch -- effectively ``wasting'' its earlier work on verifying the smaller network. In this paper, we present an enhancement to abstraction-based verification of neural networks, by using \\emph{residual reasoning}: the process of utilizing information acquired when verifying an abstract network, in order to expedite the verification of a refined network. In essence, the method allows the verifier to store information about parts of the search space in which the refined network is guaranteed to behave correctly, and allows it to focus on areas where bugs might be discovered. We implemented our approach as an extension to the Marabou verifier, and obtained promising results. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks share with Logic Programming several key relational inference mechanisms. The datasets on which they are trained and evaluated can be seen as database facts containing ground terms. This makes possible modeling their inference mechanisms with equivalent logic programs, to better understand not just how they propagate information between the entities involved in the machine learning process but also to infer limits on what can be learned from a given dataset and how well that might generalize to unseen test data. This leads us to the key idea of this paper: modeling with the help of a logic program the information flows involved in learning to infer from the link structure of a graph and the information content of its nodes properties of new nodes, given their known connections to nodes with possibly similar properties. The problem is known as graph node property prediction and our approach will consist in emulating with help of a Prolog program the key information propagation steps of a Graph Neural Network's training and inference stages. We test our a approach on the ogbn-arxiv node property inference benchmark. To infer class labels for nodes representing papers in a citation network, we distill the dependency trees of the text associated to each node into directed acyclic graphs that we encode as ground Prolog terms. Together with the set of their references to other papers, they become facts in a database on which we reason with help of a Prolog program that mimics the information propagation in graph neural networks predicting node properties. In the process, we invent ground term similarity relations that help infer labels in the test set by propagating node properties from similar nodes in the training set and we evaluate their effectiveness in comparison with that of the graph's link structure. Finally, we implement explanation generators that unveil performance upper bounds inherent to the dataset. As a practical outcome, we obtain a logic program, that, when seen as machine learning algorithm, performs close to the state of the art on the node property prediction benchmark. ",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to the backdoor attacks, which leads to malicious behaviors of DNNs when specific triggers are attached to the input images. It was further demonstrated that the infected DNNs possess a collection of channels, which are more sensitive to the backdoor triggers compared with normal channels. Pruning these channels was then shown to be effective in mitigating the backdoor behaviors. To locate those channels, it is natural to consider their Lipschitzness, which measures their sensitivity against worst-case perturbations on the inputs. In this work, we introduce a novel concept called Channel Lipschitz Constant (CLC), which is defined as the Lipschitz constant of the mapping from the input images to the output of each channel. Then we provide empirical evidences to show the strong correlation between an Upper bound of the CLC (UCLC) and the trigger-activated change on the channel activation. Since UCLC can be directly calculated from the weight matrices, we can detect the potential backdoor channels in a data-free manner, and do simple pruning on the infected DNN to repair the model. The proposed Channel Lipschitzness based Pruning (CLP) method is super fast, simple, data-free and robust to the choice of the pruning threshold. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of CLP, which achieves state-of-the-art results among the mainstream defense methods even without any data.

Especially for parametrized, time dependent problems in engineering computations, it is often the case that acceptable computational budgets limit the availability of high-fidelity, accurate simulation data.

Its key idea is to leverage many low-fidelity simulation data, less accurate but much faster to compute, to improve the approximations with limited high-fidelity data. In this work, we introduce a novel data-driven framework of multi-fidelity surrogate modeling for parametrized, time-dependent problems using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, to enhance output predictions both for unseen parameter values and forward in time simultaneously - a task known to be particularly challenging for data-driven models. We demonstrate the wide applicability of the proposed approaches in a variety of engineering problems with high- and low-fidelity data generated through fine versus coarse meshes, small versus large time steps, or finite element full-order versus deep learning reduced-order models. Numerical results show that the proposed multi-fidelity LSTM networks not only improve single-fidelity regression significantly, but also outperform the multi-fidelity models based on feed-forward neural networks.

In Bayesian networks a diagnosis or classification is typically formalized as the computation of the most probable joint value assignment to the hypothesis variables, given the observed values of the evidence variables (generally known as the MAP problem). While solving the MAP problem gives the most probable explanation of the evidence, the computation is a black box as far as the human user is concerned and it does not give additional insights that allow the user to appreciate and accept the decision. For example, a user might want to know to whether an unobserved variable could potentially (upon observation) impact the explanation, or whether it is irrelevant in this aspect. In this paper we introduce a new concept, MAP- independence, which tries to capture this notion of relevance, and explore its role towards a potential justification of an inference to the best explanation.

As human evaluation of every new model version is unfeasible, the community adopted automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU to approximate the results of human judgement. These metrics originate from the machine translation domain and it is unclear whether they are applicable for the code generation tasks and how well do they agree with the human evaluation on this task. There also are two metrics, CodeBLEU and RUBY, that were developed to estimate the similarity of code and take into account the code properties. However, for these metrics there are hardly any studies on their agreement with the human evaluation. Despite all that, minimal differences in the metric scores are used to claim superiority of some code generation models over the others. In this paper, we present a study on applicability of six metrics -- BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR, ChrF, CodeBLEU, RUBY -- for evaluation of the code generation models. We conduct a study on two different code generation datasets and use human annotators to assess the quality of all models run on these datasets. The results indicate that for the CoNaLa dataset of Python one-liners none of the metrics can correctly emulate human judgement on which model is better with $>95\\%$ certainty if the difference in model scores is less than 5 points. For the HearthStone dataset, which consists of classes of particular structure, the difference in model scores of at least 2 points is enough to claim the superiority of one model over the other. Using our findings, we derive several recommendations on using metrics to estimate the model performance on the code generation task. ",

TransPillars aggregates spatial-temporal point cloud features from two perspectives. First, it fuses voxel-level features directly from multi-frame feature maps instead of pooled instance features to preserve instance details with contextual information that are essential to accurate object localization. Second, it introduces a hierarchical coarse-to-fine strategy to fuse multi-scale features progressively to effectively capture the motion of moving objects and guide the aggregation of fine features. Besides, a variant of deformable transformer is introduced to improve the effectiveness of cross-frame feature matching. Extensive experiments show that our proposed TransPillars achieves state-of-art performance as compared to existing multi-frame detection approaches. Code will be released. ",

We then examine the relationship between our measure and the accessibility to knowledge stored in memory. To do so, we show that words that occur in several different and distinct contexts are significantly more effective in facilitating the retrieval of subsequent words than are words that lack this contextual diversity.

One popular way to achieve this property is by designing networks with a small Lipschitz constant. In this work, we propose a new technique for constructing such Lipschitz networks that has a number of desirable properties: it can be applied to any linear network layer (fully-connected or convolutional), it provides formal guarantees on the Lipschitz constant, it is easy to implement and efficient to run, and it can be combined with any training objective and optimization method. In fact, our technique is the first one in the literature that achieves all of these properties simultaneously. Our main contribution is a rescaling-based weight matrix parametrization that guarantees each network layer to have a Lipschitz constant of at most 1 and results in the learned weight matrices to be close to orthogonal. Hence we call such layers almost-orthogonal Lipschitz (AOL). Experiments and ablation studies in the context of image classification with certified robust accuracy confirm that AOL layers achieve results that are on par with most existing methods. Yet, they are simpler to implement and more broadly applicable, because they do not require computationally expensive matrix orthogonalization or inversion steps as part of the network architecture.

    "abstract": "Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a novel minimally invasive treatment that is used to ablate intracranial structures to treat mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Region of interest (ROI) segmentation before and after LITT would enable automated lesion quantification to objectively assess treatment efficacy. Deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are state-of-the-art solutions for ROI segmentation, but require large amounts of annotated data during the training. However, collecting large datasets from emerging treatments such as LITT is impractical. In this paper, we propose a progressive brain lesion synthesis framework (PAVAE) to expand both the quantity and diversity of the training dataset. Concretely, our framework consists of two sequential networks: a mask synthesis network and a mask-guided lesion synthesis network. To better employ extrinsic information to provide additional supervision during network training, we design a condition embedding block (CEB) and a mask embedding block (MEB) to encode inherent conditions of masks to the feature space. Finally, a segmentation network is trained using raw and synthetic lesion images to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Experimental results show that our method can achieve realistic synthetic results and boost the performance of down-stream segmentation tasks above traditional data augmentation techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Inter-patient abdominal registration has various applications, from pharmakinematic studies to anatomy modeling. Yet, it remains a challenging application due to the morphological heterogeneity and variability of the human abdomen. Among the various registration methods proposed for this task, probabilistic displacement registration models estimate displacement distribution for a subset of points by comparing feature vectors of points from the two images. These probabilistic models are informative and robust while allowing large displacements by design. As the displacement distributions are typically estimated on a subset of points (which we refer to as driving points), due to computational requirements, we propose in this work to learn a driving points predictor. Compared to previously proposed methods, the driving points predictor is optimized in an end-to-end fashion to infer driving points tailored for a specific registration pipeline. We evaluate the impact of our contribution on two different datasets corresponding to different modalities. Specifically, we compared the performances of 6 different probabilistic displacement registration models when using a driving points predictor or one of 2 other standard driving points selection methods. The proposed method improved performances in 11 out of 12 experiments. ",

In this work, we introduce a novel method based on parameter averaging for robust explainability in tabular data setting, referred as XTab. We first initialize and train multiple instances of a shallow network (referred as local masks) with different random seeds for a downstream task. We then obtain a global mask model by \"averaging the parameters\" of local masks and show that the global model uses the majority rule to rank features based on their relative importance across all local models. We conduct extensive experiments on a variety of real and synthetic datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method can be used for feature selection as well as to obtain the global feature importance that are not sensitive to sub-optimal model initialisation.

We propose and analyze several mitigating learning algorithms that identify trolls either at the example or at the user level.

    "abstract": "Context: In the Requirements Engineering (RE) process of an Open Source Software (OSS) community, an involved firm is a stakeholder among many. Conflicting agendas may create miss-alignment with the firm's internal requirements strategy. In communities with meritocratic governance or with aspects thereof, a firm has the opportunity to affect the RE process in line with their own agenda by gaining influence through active and symbiotic engagements. Objective: The focus of this study has been to identify what aspects that firms should consider when they assess their need of influencing the RE process in an OSS community, as well as what engagement practices that should be considered in order to gain this influence. Method: Using a design science approach, 21 interviews with 18 industry professionals from 12 different software-intensive firms were conducted to explore, design and validate an artifact for the problem context. Results: A Community Strategy Framework (CSF) is presented to help firms create community strategies that describe if and why they need influence on the RE process in a specific (meritocratic) OSS community, and how the firm could gain it. The framework consists of aspects and engagement practices. The aspects help determine how important an OSS project and its community is from business and technical perspectives. A community perspective is used when considering the feasibility and potential in gaining influence. The engagement practices are intended as a tool-box for how a firm can engage with a community in order to build influence needed. Conclusion: It is concluded from interview-based validation that the proposed CSF may provide support for firms in creating and tailoring community strategies and help them to focus resources on communities that matter and gain the influence needed on their respective RE processes.

In this work, we bring to light one conjecture regarding the fundamentals of data poisoning, which we call the Lethal Dose Conjecture. The conjecture states: If $n$ clean training samples are needed for accurate predictions, then in a size-$N$ training set, only $\\Theta(N/n)$ poisoned samples can be tolerated while ensuring accuracy. Theoretically, we verify this conjecture in multiple cases. We also offer a more general perspective of this conjecture through distribution discrimination. Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA) and its extension, Finite Aggregation (FA) are recent approaches for provable defenses against data poisoning, where they predict through the majority vote of many base models trained from different subsets of training set using a given learner. The conjecture implies that both DPA and FA are (asymptotically) optimal -- if we have the most data-efficient learner, they can turn it into one of the most robust defenses against data poisoning. This outlines a practical approach to developing stronger defenses against poisoning via finding data-efficient learners. Empirically, as a proof of concept, we show that by simply using different data augmentations for base learners, we can respectively double and triple the certified robustness of DPA on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB without sacrificing accuracy.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) applied to a device's radio-frequency fingerprint~(RFF) has attracted significant attention in physical-layer authentications due to its extraordinary classification performance. Conventional DL-RFF techniques, trained by adopting maximum likelihood estimation~(MLE), tend to overfit the channel statistics embedded in the training dataset. This restricts their practical applications as it is challenging to collect sufficient training data capturing the characteristics of all possible wireless channel environments. To address this challenge, we propose a DL framework of disentangled representation learning~(DRL) that first learns to factor the input signals into a device-relevant component and a device-irrelevant component via adversarial learning. Then, it synthesizes a set of augmented signals by shuffling these two parts within a given training dataset for training of subsequent RFF extractor. The implicit data augmentation in the proposed framework imposes a regularization on the RFF extractor to avoid the possible overfitting of device-irrelevant channel statistics, without collecting additional data from unknown channels. Experiments validate that the proposed approach, referred to as DR-RFF, outperforms conventional methods in terms of generalizability to unknown complicated propagation environments, e.g., dispersive multipath fading channels, even though all the training data are collected in a simple environment with dominated direct line-of-sight~(LoS) propagation paths.

    "abstract": "Human decision making behavior is observed with choice-response time data during psychological experiments. Drift-diffusion models of this data consist of a Wiener first-passage time (WFPT) distribution and are described by cognitive parameters: drift rate, boundary separation, and starting point. These estimated parameters are of interest to neuroscientists as they can be mapped to features of cognitive processes of decision making (such as speed, caution, and bias) and related to brain activity. The observed patterns of RT also reflect the variability of cognitive processes from trial to trial mediated by neural dynamics. We adapted a SincNet-based shallow neural network architecture to fit the Drift-Diffusion model using EEG signals on every experimental trial. The model consists of a SincNet layer, a depthwise spatial convolution layer, and two separate FC layers that predict drift rate and boundary for each trial in-parallel. The SincNet layer parametrized the kernels in order to directly learn the low and high cutoff frequencies of bandpass filters that are applied to the EEG data to predict drift and boundary parameters. During training, model parameters were updated by minimizing the negative log likelihood function of WFPT distribution given trial RT. We developed separate decision SincNet models for each participant performing a two-alternative forced-choice task. Our results showed that single-trial estimates of drift and boundary performed better at predicting RTs than the median estimates in both training and test data sets, suggesting that our model can successfully use EEG features to estimate meaningful single-trial Diffusion model parameters. Furthermore, the shallow SincNet architecture identified time windows of information processing related to evidence accumulation and caution and the EEG frequency bands that reflect these processes within each participant.

    "abstract": "Tissue segmentation is the mainstay of pathological examination, whereas the manual delineation is unduly burdensome. To assist this time-consuming and subjective manual step, researchers have devised methods to automatically segment structures in pathological images. Recently, automated machine and deep learning based methods dominate tissue segmentation research studies. However, most machine and deep learning based approaches are supervised and developed using a large number of training samples, in which the pixelwise annotations are expensive and sometimes can be impossible to obtain. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised learning paradigm by integrating an end-to-end deep mixture model with a constrained indicator to acquire accurate semantic tissue segmentation. This constraint aims to centralise the components of deep mixture models during the calculation of the optimisation function. In so doing, the redundant or empty class issues, which are common in current unsupervised learning methods, can be greatly reduced. By validation on both public and in-house datasets, the proposed deep constrained Gaussian network achieves significantly (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) better performance (with the average Dice scores of 0.737 and 0.735, respectively) on tissue segmentation with improved stability and robustness, compared to other existing unsupervised segmentation approaches. Furthermore, the proposed method presents a similar performance (p-value > 0.05) compared to the fully supervised U-Net. ",

However, despite the frequent use of TFDs in signal analysis, no study comprehensively compared their performances on deep learning for automatic diagnosis. Furthermore, the combination of signal processing methods as inputs for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has been proved as a practical approach to increasing signal classification performance. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the optimal use of TFD/ combined TFDs as input for CNNs. The presented results revealed that: 1) The transformation of the heart sound signal into the TF domain achieves higher classification performance than using of raw signals. Among the TFDs, the difference in the performance was slight for all the CNN models (within $1.3\\%$ in average accuracy). However, Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and Chirplet transform (CT) outperformed the rest. 2) The appropriate increase of the CNN capacity and architecture optimisation can improve the performance, while the network architecture should not be overly complicated. Based on the ResNet or SEResNet family results, the increase in the number of parameters and the depth of the structure do not improve the performance apparently. 3) Combining TFDs as CNN inputs did not significantly improve the classification results. The findings of this study provided the knowledge for selecting TFDs as CNN input and designing CNN architecture for heart sound classification. ",

However, these approaches currently have no guarantees for reconstruction quality and the reliability of such algorithms is only poorly understood. Adversarial attacks offer a valuable tool to understand possible failure modes and worst case performance of DL-based reconstruction algorithms. In this paper we describe adversarial attacks on multi-coil $k$-space measurements and evaluate them on the recently proposed E2E-VarNet and a simpler UNet-based model. In contrast to prior work, the attacks are targeted to specifically alter diagnostically relevant regions. Using two realistic attack models (adversarial $k$-space noise and adversarial rotations) we are able to show that current state-of-the-art DL-based reconstruction algorithms are indeed sensitive to such perturbations to a degree where relevant diagnostic information may be lost. Surprisingly, in our experiments the UNet and the more sophisticated E2E-VarNet were similarly sensitive to such attacks. Our findings add further to the evidence that caution must be exercised as DL-based methods move closer to clinical practice. ",

    "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of ground glass opacities and consolidations in chest computer tomography (CT) scans can potentially ease the burden of radiologists during times of high resource utilisation. However, deep learning models are not trusted in the clinical routine due to failing silently on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We propose a lightweight OOD detection method that leverages the Mahalanobis distance in the feature space and seamlessly integrates into state-of-the-art segmentation pipelines. The simple approach can even augment pre-trained models with clinically relevant uncertainty quantification. We validate our method across four chest CT distribution shifts and two magnetic resonance imaging applications, namely segmentation of the hippocampus and the prostate. Our results show that the proposed method effectively detects far- and near-OOD samples across all explored scenarios. ",

    "title": "Improving the visibility of minorities through network growth  interventions",
    "abstract": "Improving the position of minorities in networks via interventions is a challenge of high theoretical and societal importance. In this work, we examine how different network growth interventions impact the position of minority nodes in degree rankings over time. We distinguish between two kinds of interventions: (i) group size interventions, such as introducing quotas, that regulate the ratio of incoming minority and majority nodes; and (ii) behavioural interventions, such as homophily, i.e. varying how groups interact and connect to each other. We find that even extreme group size interventions do not have a strong effect on the position of minorities in rankings if certain behavioural changes do not manifest at the same time. For example, minority representation in rankings is not increased by high quotas if the actors in the network do not adopt homophilic behaviour. As a result, a key finding of our research is that in order for the visibility of minorities to improve, group size and behavioural interventions need to be coordinated. Moreover, their potential benefit is highly dependent on pre-intervention conditions in social networks. In a real-world case study, we explore the effectiveness of interventions to reach gender parity in academia. Our work lays a theoretical and computational foundation for further studies aiming to explore the effectiveness of interventions in growing networks. ",

    "abstract": "Discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) is a widely employed computational method to study plasticity at the mesoscale that connects the motion of dislocation lines to the macroscopic response of crystalline materials. However, the computational cost of DDD simulations remains a bottleneck that limits its range of applicability. Here, we introduce a new DDD-GNN framework in which the expensive time-integration of dislocation motion is entirely substituted by a graph neural network (GNN) model trained on DDD trajectories. As a first application, we demonstrate the feasibility and potential of our method on a simple yet relevant model of a dislocation line gliding through a forest of obstacles. We show that the DDD-GNN model is stable and reproduces very well unseen ground-truth DDD simulation responses for a range of straining rates and obstacle densities, without the need to explicitly compute nodal forces or dislocation mobilities during time-integration. Our approach opens new promising avenues to accelerate DDD simulations and to incorporate more complex dislocation motion behaviors. ",
