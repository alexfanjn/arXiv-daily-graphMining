    "abstract": "In second-order uncertain Bayesian networks, the conditional probabilities are only known within distributions, i.e., probabilities over probabilities. The delta-method has been applied to extend exact first-order inference methods to propagate both means and variances through sum-product networks derived from Bayesian networks, thereby characterizing epistemic uncertainty, or the uncertainty in the model itself. Alternatively, second-order belief propagation has been demonstrated for polytrees but not for general directed acyclic graph structures. In this work, we extend Loopy Belief Propagation to the setting of second-order Bayesian networks, giving rise to Second-Order Loopy Belief Propagation (SOLBP). For second-order Bayesian networks, SOLBP generates inferences consistent with those generated by sum-product networks, while being more computationally efficient and scalable. ",

    "abstract": "Maintaining anonymity while communicating using natural language remains a challenge. Standard authorship attribution techniques that analyze candidate authors' writing styles achieve uncomfortably high accuracy even when the number of candidate authors is high. Adversarial stylometry defends against authorship attribution with the goal of preventing unwanted deanonymization. This paper reproduces and replicates experiments in a seminal study of defenses against authorship attribution (Brennan et al., 2012). We are able to successfully reproduce and replicate the original results, although we conclude that the effectiveness of the defenses studied is overstated due to a lack of a control group in the original study. In our replication, we find new evidence suggesting that an entirely automatic method, round-trip translation, merits re-examination as it appears to reduce the effectiveness of established authorship attribution methods.

    "abstract": "Data augmentation is an essential technique in improving the generalization of deep neural networks. The majority of existing image-domain augmentations either rely on geometric and structural transformations, or apply different kinds of photometric distortions. In this paper, we propose an effective technique for image augmentation by injecting contextually meaningful knowledge into the scenes. Our method of semantically meaningful image augmentation for object detection via language grounding, SemAug, starts by calculating semantically appropriate new objects that can be placed into relevant locations in the image (the what and where problems). Then it embeds these objects into their relevant target locations, thereby promoting diversity of object instance distribution. Our method allows for introducing new object instances and categories that may not even exist in the training set. Furthermore, it does not require the additional overhead of training a context network, so it can be easily added to existing architectures. Our comprehensive set of evaluations showed that the proposed method is very effective in improving the generalization, while the overhead is negligible. In particular, for a wide range of model architectures, our method achieved ~2-4% and ~1-2% mAP improvements for the task of object detection on the Pascal VOC and COCO datasets, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "The pedestrian intention prediction problem is to estimate whether or not the target pedestrian will cross the street. State-of-the-art approaches heavily rely on visual information collected with the front camera of the ego-vehicle to make a prediction of the pedestrian's intention. As such, the performance of existing methods significantly degrades when the visual information is not accurate, e.g., when the distance between the pedestrian and ego-vehicle is far, or the lighting conditions are not good enough. In this paper, we design, implement, and evaluate the first pedestrian intention prediction model based on integration of motion sensor data gathered with the smartwatch (or smartphone) of the pedestrian. A novel machine learning architecture is proposed to effectively incorporate the motion sensor data to reinforce the visual information to significantly improve the performance in adverse situations where the visual information may be unreliable. We also conduct a large-scale data collection and present the first pedestrian intention prediction dataset integrated with time-synchronized motion sensor data. The dataset consists of a total of 128 video clips with different distances and varying levels of lighting conditions. We trained our model using the widely-used JAAD and our own datasets and compare the performance with a state-of-the-art model. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art method particularly when the distance to the pedestrian is far (over 70m), and the lighting conditions are not sufficient. ",

However, all existing machine learning-based algorithms for seizure analysis require access to the labeled seizure data while acquiring labeled data is very labor intensive, expensive, as well as clinicians dependent given the subjective nature of the visual qualitative interpretation of EEG signals. In this paper, we propose to detect seizure channels and clips in a self-supervised manner where no access to the seizure data is needed. The proposed method considers local structural and contextual information embedded in EEG graphs by employing positive and negative sub-graphs. We train our method through minimizing contrastive and generative losses. The employ of local EEG sub-graphs makes the algorithm an appropriate choice when accessing to the all EEG channels is impossible due to complications such as skull fractures. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on the largest seizure dataset and demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in the EEG-based seizure study. The proposed method is the only study that requires no access to the seizure data in its training phase, yet establishes a new state-of-the-art to the field, and outperforms all related supervised methods.

Previous work has traditionally employed source code reuse metrics for prediction purposes, e.g., in the context of defect prediction. Objective. However, our research identifies two noticeable limitations of current literature. First, still little is known on the extent to which developers actually employ code reuse mechanisms over time. Second, it is still unclear how these mechanisms may contribute to explain defect-proneness and maintenance effort during software evolution. We aim at bridging this gap of knowledge, as an improved understanding of these aspects might provide insights into the actual support provided by these mechanisms, e.g., by suggesting whether and how to use them for prediction purposes. Method. We propose an exploratory study aiming at (1) assessing how developers use inheritance and delegation during software evolution; and (2) statistically analyze the impact of inheritance and delegation on fault proneness and maintenance effort.

The case with a single fin as well as multiple morphable fins are studied. A comparison of Xception network and regular CNN is presented for the case with a single fin design. Results show that high accuracy in prediction is observed for single fin design particularly using Xception network. Increasing design freedom to multiple fins increases the error in prediction.

To deep-layer networks, we present a general result called sparse-matrix principle, which could describe some basic behavior of deep layers and explain the phenomenon of the sparse-activation mode that appears in engineering applications associated with brain science; an advantage of deep layers compared to shallower ones is manifested in this principle. As applications, a general solution of deep neural networks for classification is constructed by that principle; and we also use the principle to study the data-disentangling property of encoders. Analogous to the three-layer case, the solution of deep layers is also explored through several dimensions. The mechanism of multi-output neural networks is explained from the perspective of interpolation matrices. ",

Identifying these experts helps to improve software maintenance and evolution activities, such as developing new features, code reviews, and bug fixes. Although some studies have proposed repository mining techniques to automatically identify source code experts, there are still gaps in this area that can be explored. For example, investigating new variables related to source code knowledge and applying machine learning aiming to improve the performance of techniques to identify source code experts. The goal of this study is to investigate opportunities to improve the performance of existing techniques to recommend source code files experts. We built an oracle by collecting data from the development history and surveying developers of 113 software projects. Then, we use this oracle to: (i) analyze the correlation between measures extracted from the development history and the developers source code knowledge and (ii) investigate the use of machine learning classifiers by evaluating their performance in identifying source code files experts. First Authorship and Recency of Modification are the variables with the highest positive and negative correlations with source code knowledge, respectively. Machine learning classifiers outperformed the linear techniques (F-Measure = 71% to 73%) in the public dataset, but this advantage is not clear in the private dataset, with F-Measure ranging from 55% to 68% for the linear techniques and 58% to 67% for ML techniques. Overall, the linear techniques and the machine learning classifiers achieved similar performance, particularly if we analyze F-Measure. However, machine learning classifiers usually get higher precision while linear techniques obtained the highest recall values. ",

Second, a set of Gabor filters are used to smooth the input images and the color edge strength maps are extracted, which are fused into a new ESM with the noise robustness and accurate edge extraction. Third, Embedding the fused ESM in the route of the Canny detector yields a noise-robust color edge detector. The results show that the proposed detector has the better experience in detection accuracy and noise-robustness. ",

We introduce a new technique, polymorphic lenses, that improves exploratory search over a KG by obtaining new leverage from the existing preference models that KG-based systems maintain for recommending content. The approach is based on a simple but powerful observation: in a KG, preference models can be re-targeted to recommend not only entities of a single base entity type (e.g., papers in the scientific literature KG, products in an e-commerce KG), but also all other types (e.g., authors, conferences, institutions; sellers, buyers). We implement our technique in a novel system, FeedLens, which is built over Semantic Scholar, a production system for navigating the scientific literature KG. FeedLens reuses the existing preference models on Semantic Scholar -- people's curated research feeds -- as lenses for exploratory search. Semantic Scholar users can curate multiple feeds/lenses for different topics of interest, e.g., one for human-centered AI and another for document embeddings. Although these lenses are defined in terms of papers, FeedLens re-purposes them to also guide search over authors, institutions, venues, etc. Our system design is based on feedback from intended users via two pilot surveys (n=17 and n=13, respectively). We compare FeedLens and Semantic Scholar via a third (within-subjects) user study (n=15) and find that FeedLens increases user engagement while reducing the cognitive effort required to complete a short literature review task. Our qualitative results also highlight people's preference for this more effective exploratory search experience enabled by FeedLens. ",

In this paper, we propose to relieve this challenging problem by introducing the segmentation technology into HAR, yielding joint activity segmentation and recognition. Especially, we introduce the Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network (MS-TCN) architecture for sample-level activity prediction to joint segment and recognize the activity sequence. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of HAR against the inter-class similarity and intra-class heterogeneity, a multi-level contrastive loss, containing the sample-level and segment-level contrast, has been proposed to learn a well-structured embedding space for better activity segmentation and recognition performance. Finally, with comprehensive experiments, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on two public HAR datasets, achieving significant improvements in the various evaluation metrics. ",

Proper authentication can protect the network from unauthorized adversaries.

Trust and Reputation Management (TRM) is an effective approach to continuously evaluate the trustworthiness of each participant by collecting and processing evidence of their interactions with other nodes and the infrastructure. In this article, we argue that blockchain-based TRM is critical to build trustworthy 6G networks, where blockchain acts as a decentralized platform for collaboratively managing and processing interaction evidence with the end goal of quantifying trust. We present a case study of resource management in 6G networks, where blockchain-based TRM quantifies and maintains reputation scores by evaluating fulfillment of resource owner's obligations and facilitating resource consumers to provide feedback.

Prior work has shown strong conditional lower bounds for general dynamic graphs, yet graph families that arise in practice often exhibit structural properties that the existing lower bound constructions do not possess. We study three specific graph families that are ubiquitous, namely constant-degree graphs, power-law graphs, and expander graphs, and give the first conditional lower bounds for them. Our results show that even when restricting our attention to one of these graph classes, any algorithm for fundamental graph problems such as distance computation or approximation or maximum matching, cannot simultaneously achieve a sub-polynomial update time and query time. For example, we show that the same lower bounds as for general graphs hold for maximum matching and ($s,t$)-distance in constant-degree graphs, power-law graphs or expanders. Namely, in an $m$-edge graph, there exists no dynamic algorithms with both $O(m^{1/2 - \\epsilon})$ update time and $ O(m^{1 -\\epsilon})$ query time, for any small $\\epsilon > 0$. Note that for ($s,t$)-distance the trivial dynamic algorithm achieves an almost matching upper bound of constant update time and $O(m)$ query time. We prove similar bounds for the other graph families and for other fundamental problems such as densest subgraph detection and perfect matching. ",

    "abstract": "Context: Test smells are symptoms of sub-optimal design choices adopted when developing test cases. Previous studies have proved their harmfulness for test code maintainability and effectiveness. Therefore, researchers have been proposing automated, heuristic-based techniques to detect them. However, the performance of such detectors is still limited and dependent on thresholds to be tuned. Objective: We propose the design and experimentation of a novel test smell detection approach based on machine learning to detect four test smells. Method: We plan to develop the largest dataset of manually-validated test smells. This dataset will be leveraged to train six machine learners and assess their capabilities in within- and cross-project scenarios. Finally, we plan to compare our approach with state-of-the-art heuristic-based techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Weakly Supervised Object Detection (WSOD) is a task that detects objects in an image using a model trained only on image-level annotations. Current state-of-the-art models benefit from self-supervised instance-level supervision, but since weak supervision does not include count or location information, the most common ``argmax'' labeling method often ignores many instances of objects. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel multiple instance labeling method called object discovery. We further introduce a new contrastive loss under weak supervision where no instance-level information is available for sampling, called weakly supervised contrastive loss (WSCL). WSCL aims to construct a credible similarity threshold for object discovery by leveraging consistent features for embedding vectors in the same class. As a result, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on MS-COCO 2014 and 2017 as well as PASCAL VOC 2012, and competitive results on PASCAL VOC 2007. ",

    "abstract": "Significant improvement has been made on just noticeable difference (JND) modelling due to the development of deep neural networks, especially for the recently developed unsupervised-JND generation models. However, they have a major drawback that the generated JND is assessed in the real-world signal domain instead of in the perceptual domain in the human brain. There is an obvious difference when JND is assessed in such two domains since the visual signal in the real world is encoded before it is delivered into the brain with the human visual system (HVS). Hence, we propose an HVS-inspired signal degradation network for JND estimation. To achieve this, we carefully analyze the HVS perceptual process in JND subjective viewing to obtain relevant insights, and then design an HVS-inspired signal degradation (HVS-SD) network to represent the signal degradation in the HVS. On the one hand, the well learnt HVS-SD enables us to assess the JND in the perceptual domain. On the other hand, it provides more accurate prior information for better guiding JND generation. Additionally, considering the requirement that reasonable JND should not lead to visual attention shifting, a visual attention loss is proposed to control JND generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the SOTA performance for accurately estimating the redundancy of the HVS.

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of user-generated online videos, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has attracted increasing attention recently. Despite significant progress, there are still two major challenges on the way towards robust MSA: 1) inefficiency when modeling cross-modal interactions in unaligned multimodal data; and 2) vulnerability to random modality feature missing which typically occurs in realistic settings. In this paper, we propose a generic and unified framework to address them, named Efficient Multimodal Transformer with Dual-Level Feature Restoration (EMT-DLFR). Concretely, EMT employs utterance-level representations from each modality as the global multimodal context to interact with local unimodal features and mutually promote each other. It not only avoids the quadratic scaling cost of previous local-local cross-modal interaction methods but also leads to better performance. To improve model robustness in the incomplete modality setting, on the one hand, DLFR performs low-level feature reconstruction to implicitly encourage the model to learn semantic information from incomplete data. On the other hand, it innovatively regards complete and incomplete data as two different views of one sample and utilizes siamese representation learning to explicitly attract their high-level representations. Comprehensive experiments on three popular datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both complete and incomplete modality settings. ",

Most existing KGE methods suffer from the sparsity challenge, where it is harder to predict entities that appear less frequently in knowledge graphs. In this work, we propose a novel framework KRACL to alleviate the widespread sparsity in KGs with graph context and contrastive learning. Firstly, we propose the Knowledge Relational Attention Network (KRAT) to leverage the graph context by simultaneously projecting neighboring triples to different latent spaces and jointly aggregating messages with the attention mechanism. KRAT is capable of capturing the subtle semantic information and importance of different context triples as well as leveraging multi-hop information in knowledge graphs. Secondly, we propose the knowledge contrastive loss by combining the contrastive loss with cross entropy loss, which introduces more negative samples and thus enriches the feedback to sparse entities. Our experiments demonstrate that KRACL achieves superior results across various standard knowledge graph benchmarks, especially on WN18RR and NELL-995 which have large numbers of low in-degree entities. Extensive experiments also bear out KRACL's effectiveness in handling sparse knowledge graphs and robustness against noisy triples. ",

Symbolic approaches can guarantee sound and complete semantic entailment but are sensitive to inconsistency and missing information. To this end, we propose FALCON, a Fuzzy ALC Ontology Neural reasoner. FALCON uses fuzzy logic operators to generate single model structures for arbitrary ALC ontologies, and uses multiple model structures to compute semantic entailments. Theoretical results demonstrate that FALCON is guaranteed to be a sound and complete algorithm for computing semantic entailments over ALC ontologies. Experimental results show that FALCON enables not only approximate reasoning (reasoning over incomplete ontologies) and paraconsistent reasoning (reasoning over inconsistent ontologies), but also improves machine learning in the biomedical domain by incorporating background knowledge from ALC ontologies.

We design a KG triple transformation method to enable Transformer to handle KGs, which is further strengthened by the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) sparse activation. We then formulate the complex logical queries as masked prediction and introduce a two-stage masked pre-training strategy to improve transferability and generalizability. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that kgTransformer can consistently outperform both KG embedding-based baselines and advanced encoders on nine in-domain and out-of-domain reasoning tasks.

Knowledge of how humans organize and relate their ideas and behavior within a society helps to understand their actions and attitudes towards different issues. However, the selection of common traits that shape a cultural area is somewhat arbitrary. What is needed is a method that can leverage the massive amounts of data coming online, especially through social media, to identify cultural regions without ad-hoc assumptions, biases or prejudices. In this work, we take a crucial step towards this direction by introducing a method to infer cultural regions based on the automatic analysis of large datasets from microblogging posts. Our approach is based on the principle that cultural affiliation can be inferred from the topics that people discuss among themselves. Specifically, we measure regional variations in written discourse generated in American social media. From the frequency distributions of content words in geotagged Tweets, we find the words' usage regional hotspots, and from there we derive principal components of regional variation. Through a hierarchical clustering of the data in this lower-dimensional space, our method yields clear cultural areas and the topics of discussion that define them. We obtain a manifest North-South separation, which is primarily influenced by the African American culture, and further contiguous (East-West) and non-contiguous (urban-rural) divisions that provide a comprehensive picture of today's cultural areas in the US.

Viewing an object from multiple perspectives aids holistic understanding of an object which is particularly important in situations where data annotations are limited. In this paper, we present an approach that combines self-supervised learning with a multi-perspective matching technique and demonstrate its effectiveness on learning higher quality representations on data captured by a robotic vacuum with an embedded camera.

Indeed, many approaches for verifying neural networks have been recently proposed, but these generally struggle with limited scalability or insufficient accuracy. A key component in many state-of-the-art verification schemes is computing lower and upper bounds on the values that neurons in the network can obtain for a specific input domain -- and the tighter these bounds, the more likely the verification is to succeed. Many common algorithms for computing these bounds are variations of the symbolic-bound propagation method; and among these, approaches that utilize a process called back-substitution are particularly successful. In this paper, we present an approach for making back-substitution produce tighter bounds. To achieve this, we formulate and then minimize the imprecision errors incurred during back-substitution. Our technique is general, in the sense that it can be integrated into numerous existing symbolic-bound propagation techniques, with only minor modifications. We implement our approach as a proof-of-concept tool, and present favorable results compared to state-of-the-art verifiers that perform back-substitution. ",

Prior art mainly learns a relevance judgment model with semantic features of the query and document and ignores directly counterfactual relevance evaluation from the clicking log. Though the learned semantic matching models can provide relevance signals for tail queries as long as the semantic feature is available. However, such a paradigm lacks the capability to introspectively adjust the biased relevance estimation whenever it conflicts with massive implicit user feedback. The counterfactual evaluation methods, on the contrary, ensure unbiased relevance estimation with sufficient click information. However, they suffer from the sparse or even missing clicks caused by the long-tailed query distribution. In this paper, we propose to unify the counterfactual evaluating and learning approaches for unbiased relevance estimation on search queries with various popularities. Specifically, we theoretically develop a doubly robust estimator with low bias and variance, which intentionally combines the benefits of existing relevance evaluating and learning approaches. We further instantiate the proposed unbiased relevance estimation framework in Baidu search, with comprehensive practical solutions designed regarding the data pipeline for click behavior tracking and online relevance estimation with an approximated deep neural network. Finally, we present extensive empirical evaluations to verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework, finding that it is robust in practice and manages to improve online ranking performance substantially.

A large catalog of augmentation functions have been used for SSL-based AD (SSAD), and recent works have observed that the type of augmentation has a significant impact on performance. Motivated by those, this work sets out to put SSAD under a larger lens and carefully investigate the role of data augmentation in AD through extensive experiments on many testbeds. Our main finding is that self-supervision acts as a yet-another model hyperparameter, and should be chosen carefully in regards to the nature of true anomalies in the data. That is, the alignment between the augmentation and the underlying anomaly-generating mechanism is the key for the success of SSAD, and in the lack thereof, SSL can even impair (!) detection performance. Moving beyond proposing another SSAD method, our study contributes to the better understanding of this growing area and lays out new directions for future research. ",

We extended the current state-of-the-art frameworks by adding various quality dimensions (QDs) and quality metrics (QMs) that are specific to KGs. Furthermore, we propose a general-purpose, customizable to a domain or task, and practical quality assessment framework for assessing the quality of KGs. ",

    "abstract": "Can we employ one neural model to efficiently dismantle many complex yet unique networks? This article provides an affirmative answer. Diverse real-world systems can be abstracted as complex networks each consisting of many functional nodes and edges. Percolation theory has indicated that removing only a few vital nodes can cause the collapse of whole network. However, finding the least number of such vital nodes is a rather challenging task for large networks due to its NP-hardness. Previous studies have proposed many centrality measures and heuristic algorithms to tackle this network dismantling (ND) problem. Different from theirs, this article tries to approach the ND task by designing a neural model which can be trained from tiny synthetic networks but will be applied for various real-world networks. It seems a discouraging mission at first sight, as network sizes and topologies are quite different across distinct real-world networks. Nonetheless, this article initiates insightful efforts of designing and training a neural influence ranking model (NIRM). Experiments on fifteen real-world networks validate its effectiveness for its mostly requiring fewer vital nodes to dismantle a network, compared with the state-of-the-art competitors. The key to its success lies in that our NIRM can efficiently encode both local structural and global topological signals for ranking nodes, in addition to our innovative labelling method in training dataset construction.

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks consist of randomly distributed sensor nodes for monitoring targets or areas of interest. Maintaining the network for continuous surveillance is a challenge due to the limited battery capacity in each sensor. Wireless power transfer technology is emerging as a reliable solution for energizing the sensors by deploying a mobile charger (MC) to recharge the sensor. However, designing an optimal charging path for the MC is challenging because of uncertainties arising in the networks. The energy consumption rate of the sensors may fluctuate significantly due to unpredictable changes in the network topology, such as node failures. These changes also lead to shifts in the importance of each sensor, which are often assumed to be the same in existing works. We address these challenges in this paper by proposing a novel adaptive charging scheme using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. Specifically, we endow the MC with a charging policy that determines the next sensor to charge conditioning on the current state of the network. We then use a deep neural network to parametrize this charging policy, which will be trained by reinforcement learning techniques. Our model can adapt to spontaneous changes in the network topology. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing on-demand algorithms by a significant margin. ",

    "abstract": "Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims at distinguishing face spoof attacks from the authentic ones, which is typically approached by learning proper models for performing the associated classification task. In practice, one would expect such models to be generalized to FAS in different image domains. Moreover, it is not practical to assume that the type of spoof attacks would be known in advance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model for addressing the aforementioned domain-generalized face anti-spoofing task. In particular, our proposed network is able to disentangle facial liveness representation from the irrelevant ones (i.e., facial content and image domain features). The resulting liveness representation exhibits sufficient domain invariant properties, and thus it can be applied for performing domain-generalized FAS. In our experiments, we conduct experiments on five benchmark datasets with various settings, and we verify that our model performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches in identifying novel types of spoof attacks in unseen image domains.

    "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of organs-at-risks (OARs) is a precursor for optimizing radiation therapy planning. Existing deep learning-based multi-scale fusion architectures have demonstrated a tremendous capacity for 2D medical image segmentation. The key to their success is aggregating global context and maintaining high resolution representations. However, when translated into 3D segmentation problems, existing multi-scale fusion architectures might underperform due to their heavy computation overhead and substantial data diet. To address this issue, we propose a new OAR segmentation framework, called OARFocalFuseNet, which fuses multi-scale features and employs focal modulation for capturing global-local context across multiple scales. Each resolution stream is enriched with features from different resolution scales, and multi-scale information is aggregated to model diverse contextual ranges. As a result, feature representations are further boosted. The comprehensive comparisons in our experimental setup with OAR segmentation as well as multi-organ segmentation show that our proposed OARFocalFuseNet outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on publicly available OpenKBP datasets and Synapse multi-organ segmentation. Both of the proposed methods (3D-MSF and OARFocalFuseNet) showed promising performance in terms of standard evaluation metrics. Our best performing method (OARFocalFuseNet) obtained a dice coefficient of 0.7995 and hausdorff distance of 5.1435 on OpenKBP datasets and dice coefficient of 0.8137 on Synapse multi-organ segmentation dataset.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has drawn an increased attention in the field of speech processing. Recent studies have demonstrated that contrastive learning is able to learn discriminative speaker embeddings in a self-supervised manner. However, base contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) assumes that the pairs generated from a view of anchor instance and any view of other instances are all negative, which introduces many false negative pairs in constructing the loss function. The problem is referred as $class$-$collision$, which remains as one major issue that impedes the CSSL based speaker verification (SV) systems from achieving better performances. In the meanwhile, studies reveal that negative sample free SSL frameworks perform well in learning speaker or image representations. In this study, we investigate SSL techniques that lead to an improved SV performance. We first analyse the impact of false negative pairs in the CSSL systems. Then, a multi-stage Class-Collision Correction (C3) method is proposed, which leads to the state-of-the-art CSSL based speaker embedding system. On the basis of the pretrained CSSL model, we further propose to employ a negative sample free SSL objective (i.e., DINO) to fine-tune the speaker embedding network. The resulting speaker embedding system (C3-DINO) achieves 2.5% EER with a simple Cosine Distance Scoring method on Voxceleb1 test set, which outperforms the previous SOTA SSL system (4.86%) by a significant +45% relative improvement. With speaker clustering and pseudo labeling on Voxceleb2 training set, a LDA/CDS back-end applying on the C3-DINO speaker embeddings is able to further push the EER to 2.2%. Comprehensive experimental investigations of the Voxceleb benchmarks and our internal dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, and the performance gap between the SSL SV and the supervised counterpart narrows further.

    "abstract": "Denoising of magnetic resonance images is beneficial in improving the quality of low signal-to-noise ratio images. Recently, denoising using deep neural networks has demonstrated promising results. Most of these networks, however, utilize supervised learning, which requires large training images of noise-corrupted and clean image pairs. Obtaining training images, particularly clean images, is expensive and time-consuming. Hence, methods such as Noise2Noise (N2N) that require only pairs of noise-corrupted images have been developed to reduce the burden of obtaining training datasets. In this study, we propose a new self-supervised denoising method, Coil2Coil (C2C), that does not require the acquisition of clean images or paired noise-corrupted images for training. Instead, the method utilizes multichannel data from phased-array coils to generate training images. First, it divides and combines multichannel coil images into two images, one for input and the other for label. Then, they are processed to impose noise independence and sensitivity normalization such that they can be used for the training images of N2N. For inference, the method inputs a coil-combined image (e.g., DICOM image), enabling a wide application of the method. When evaluated using synthetic noise-added images, C2C shows the best performance against several self-supervised methods, reporting comparable outcomes to supervised methods. When testing the DICOM images, C2C successfully denoised real noise without showing structure-dependent residuals in the error maps. Because of the significant advantage of not requiring additional scans for clean or paired images, the method can be easily utilized for various clinical applications. ",

    "abstract": "Risk management in many environmental settings requires an understanding of the mechanisms that drive extreme events. Useful metrics for quantifying such risk are extreme quantiles of response variables conditioned on predictor variables that describe e.g., climate, biosphere and environmental states. Typically these quantiles lie outside the range of observable data and so, for estimation, require specification of parametric extreme value models within a regression framework. Classical approaches in this context utilise linear or additive relationships between predictor and response variables and suffer in either their predictive capabilities or computational efficiency; moreover, their simplicity is unlikely to capture the truly complex structures that lead to the creation of extreme wildfires. In this paper, we propose a new methodological framework for performing extreme quantile regression using artificial neutral networks, which are able to capture complex non-linear relationships and scale well to high-dimensional data. The \"black box\" nature of neural networks means that they lack the desirable trait of interpretability often favoured by practitioners; thus, we combine aspects of linear, and additive, models with deep learning to create partially interpretable neural networks that can be used for statistical inference but retain high prediction accuracy. To complement this methodology, we further propose a novel point process model for extreme values which overcomes the finite lower-endpoint problem associated with the generalised extreme value class of distributions. Efficacy of our unified framework is illustrated on U.S. wildfire data with a high-dimensional predictor set and we illustrate vast improvements in predictive performance over linear and spline-based regression techniques.

The uncertainty due to renewables is modeled using joint chance-constraint and the mismatch caused by contingencies and renewables are handled using reserves. We consider a distributionally robust approach to solve the chance-constrained program. We assume that samples of the uncertainty are available. Using them, we construct a set of distributions, termed ambiguity set, containing all distributions that are close to the empirical distribution under the Wasserstein metric. The chance constraint is imposed for all distributions in the ambiguity set to form the distributionally robust optimization problem. This problem is nonconvex and computationally heavy to solve exactly. We adopt a two-step approach to find an approximate solution. In the first step, we construct a polyhedral set in the space of uncertainty that contains enough mass under all distributions in the ambiguity set. This set is constructed by solving several two-dimensional distributionally robust problems. In the second step, we solve a linear robust optimization problem where the uncertain constraint is imposed for all uncertainty values lying in the polyhedral set. We demonstrate the scalability and robustness of our method using numerical experiments. ",

    "abstract": "Many recent machine learning tasks resort to quantum computing to improve classification accuracy and training efficiency by taking advantage of quantum mechanics, known as quantum machine learning (QML). The variational quantum circuit (VQC) is frequently utilized to build a quantum neural network (QNN), which is a counterpart to the conventional neural network. Due to hardware limitations, however, current quantum devices only allow one to use few qubits to represent data and perform simple quantum computations. The limited quantum resource on a single quantum device degrades the data usage and limits the scale of the quantum circuits, preventing quantum advantage to some extent. To alleviate this constraint, we propose an approach to implementing a scalable quantum neural network (SQNN) by utilizing the quantum resource of multiple small-size quantum devices cooperatively. In an SQNN system, several quantum devices are used as quantum feature extractors, extracting local features from an input instance in parallel, and a quantum device works as a quantum predictor, performing prediction over the local features collected through classical communication channels. The quantum feature extractors in the SQNN system are independent of each other, so one can flexibly use quantum devices of varying sizes, with larger quantum devices extracting more local features. Especially, the SQNN can be performed on a single quantum device in a modular fashion. Our work is exploratory and carried out on a quantum system simulator using the TensorFlow Quantum library. The evaluation conducts a binary classification on the MNIST dataset. It shows that the SQNN model achieves a comparable classification accuracy to a regular QNN model of the same scale. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the SQNN model with more quantum resources can significantly improve classification accuracy. ",
