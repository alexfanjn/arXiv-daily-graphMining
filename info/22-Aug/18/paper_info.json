    "title": "Reshi: Recommending Resources for Scientific Workflow Tasks on  Heterogeneous Infrastructures",
    "abstract": "Scientific workflows typically comprise a multitude of different processing steps which often are executed in parallel on different partitions of the input data. These executions, in turn, must be scheduled on the compute nodes of the computational infrastructure at hand. This assignment is complicated by the facts that (a) tasks typically have highly heterogeneous resource requirements and (b) in many infrastructures, compute nodes offer highly heterogeneous resources. In consequence, predictions of the runtime of a given task on a given node, as required by many scheduling algorithms, are often rather imprecise, which can lead to sub-optimal scheduling decisions. We propose Reshi, a method for recommending task-node assignments during workflow execution that can cope with heterogeneous tasks and heterogeneous nodes. Reshi approaches the problem as a regression task, where task-node pairs are modeled as feature vectors over the results of dedicated micro benchmarks and past task executions. Based on these features, Reshi trains a regression tree model to rank and recommend nodes for each ready-to-run task, which can be used as input to a scheduler. For our evaluation, we benchmarked 27 AWS machine types using three representative workflows. We compare Reshi's recommendations with three state-of-the-art schedulers. Our evaluation shows that Reshi outperforms HEFT by a mean makespan reduction of 7.18% and 18.01% assuming a mean task runtime prediction error of 15%. ",

Client data privacy is paramount in FL. At the same time, the model must be protected from poisoning attacks from adversarial clients. Existing solutions address these two problems in isolation. We present FedPerm, a new FL algorithm that addresses both these problems by combining a novel intra-model parameter shuffling technique that amplifies data privacy, with Private Information Retrieval (PIR) based techniques that permit cryptographic aggregation of clients' model updates. The combination of these techniques further helps the federation server constrain parameter updates from clients so as to curtail effects of model poisoning attacks by adversarial clients. We further present FedPerm's unique hyperparameters that can be used effectively to trade off computation overheads with model utility. Our empirical evaluation on the MNIST dataset demonstrates FedPerm's effectiveness over existing Differential Privacy (DP) enforcement solutions in FL. ",

The applications of this field ranges from generating highlight videos in sports, to intelligent surveillance and gesture recognition. Most activity recognition systems rely on a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform feature extraction from the data and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to determine the time dependent nature of the data. This paper proposes and designs two transformer neural networks for human activity recognition: a recurrent transformer (ReT), a specialized neural network used to make predictions on sequences of data, as well as a vision transformer (ViT), a transformer optimized for extracting salient features from images, to improve speed and scalability of activity recognition. We have provided an extensive comparison of the proposed transformer neural networks with the contemporary CNN and RNN-based human activity recognition models in terms of speed and accuracy. ",

In this paper, we propose an optimal sensors-based simulation method for spatiotemporal event detection using human activity signals derived from taxi trip data. A sensor here is an abstract concept such that only the true observation data at the sensor location will be treated as known data for the simulation. Specifically, we first identify the optimal number of sensors and their locations that have the strongest correlation with the whole dataset. The observation data points from these sensors are then used to simulate a regular, uneventful scenario using the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method. By comparing the simulated and observation scenarios, events are extracted both spatially and temporally. We apply this method in New York City with taxi trip records data. Results show that this method is effective in detecting when and where events occur. ",

As use case, we consider the research groups of a university faculty as elements, and the departments and joint research projects as sets. We aim at finding a suitable mapping between the research groups and the grid cells such that the department structure forms a base map layout. Our objectives are to optimize both the compactness of the entirety of all cells and of each set by itself. We show that computing the mapping is NP-hard. However, using integer linear programming we can solve real-world instances optimally within a few seconds. Moreover, we propose a relaxation of the contiguity requirement to visualize otherwise non-embeddable set systems. We present and discuss different rendering styles for the set overlays.

A virtualized network slice is a logical combination of multiple virtual network functions, which run on virtual machines (VMs) as software applications by virtualization techniques. As the performance of network slices hinges on the normal running of VMs, detecting and analyzing anomalies in VMs are critical. Based on the three-tier management framework of virtualized network slicing, we first develop a federated learning (FL) based three-tier distributed VM anomaly detection framework, which enables distributed network slice managers to collaboratively train a global VM anomaly detection model while keeping metrics data locally. The high-dimensional, imbalanced, and distributed data features in virtualized network slicing scenarios invalidate the existing anomaly detection models. Considering the powerful ability of generative adversarial network (GAN) in capturing the distribution from complex data, we design a new multi-discriminator Bidirectional Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (BiWGAN-GP) model to learn the normal data distribution from high-dimensional resource metrics datasets that are spread on multiple VM monitors. The multi-discriminator BiWGAN-GP model can be trained over distributed data sources, which avoids high communication and computation overhead caused by the centralized collection and processing of local data. We define an anomaly score as the discriminant criterion to quantify the deviation of new metrics data from the learned normal distribution to detect abnormal behaviors arising in VMs. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed collaborative anomaly detection algorithm are validated through extensive experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset.

    "abstract": "Rapid progress in machine learning for natural language processing has the potential to transform debates about how humans learn language. However, the learning environments and biases of current artificial learners and humans diverge in ways that weaken the impact of the evidence obtained from learning simulations. For example, today's most effective neural language models are trained on roughly one thousand times the amount of linguistic data available to a typical child. To increase the relevance of learnability results from computational models, we need to train model learners without significant advantages over humans. If an appropriate model successfully acquires some target linguistic knowledge, it can provide a proof of concept that the target is learnable in a hypothesized human learning scenario. Plausible model learners will enable us to carry out experimental manipulations to make causal inferences about variables in the learning environment, and to rigorously test poverty-of-the-stimulus-style claims arguing for innate linguistic knowledge in humans on the basis of speculations about learnability. Comparable experiments will never be possible with human subjects due to practical and ethical considerations, making model learners an indispensable resource. So far, attempts to deprive current models of unfair advantages obtain sub-human results for key grammatical behaviors such as acceptability judgments. But before we can justifiably conclude that language learning requires more prior domain-specific knowledge than current models possess, we must first explore non-linguistic inputs in the form of multimodal stimuli and multi-agent interaction as ways to make our learners more efficient at learning from limited linguistic input.

    "abstract": "Feature embeddings are one of the most essential steps when training deep learning based Click-Through Rate prediction models, which map high-dimensional sparse features to dense embedding vectors. Classic human-crafted embedding size selection methods are shown to be \"sub-optimal\" in terms of the trade-off between memory usage and model capacity. The trending methods in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) have demonstrated their efficiency to search for embedding sizes. However, most existing NAS-based works suffer from expensive computational costs, the curse of dimensionality of the search space, and the discrepancy between continuous search space and discrete candidate space. Other works that prune embeddings in an unstructured manner fail to reduce the computational costs explicitly. In this paper, to address those limitations, we propose a novel strategy that searches for the optimal mixed-dimension embedding scheme by structurally pruning a super-net via Hard Auxiliary Mask. Our method aims to directly search candidate models in the discrete space using a simple and efficient gradient-based method. Furthermore, we introduce orthogonal regularity on embedding tables to reduce correlations within embedding columns and enhance representation capacity. Extensive experiments demonstrate it can effectively remove redundant embedding dimensions without great performance loss. ",

To minimize the QKD deployment cost in SAGIN with heterogeneous nodes, in this paper, we propose a resource allocation scheme for QKD over SAGIN using stochastic programming. The proposed scheme is formulated via two-stage stochastic programming (SP), while considering uncertainties such as security requirements and weather conditions. Under extensive experiments, the results clearly show that the proposed scheme can achieve the optimal deployment cost under various security requirements and unpredictable weather conditions. ",

For example, the timing-based attacks in processor caches are shown to be successful in stealing secret keys or causing privilege escalation. So far, finding cache-timing vulnerabilities is mostly performed by human experts, which is inefficient and laborious. There is a need for automatic tools that can explore vulnerabilities because unreported vulnerabilities leave the systems at risk. In this paper, we propose AutoCAT, an automated exploration framework that finds cache timing-channel attacks using reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, AutoCAT formulates the cache timing-channel attack as a guessing game between the attacker program and the victim program holding a secret, which can thus be solved via modern deep RL techniques. AutoCAT can explore attacks in various cache configurations without knowing design details and under different attacker and victim configurations, and also find attacks to bypass known detection and defense mechanisms. In particular, AutoCAT discovered StealthyStreamline, a new attack that is able to bypass detection based on performance counters and has up to a 71% higher information leakage rate than the state-of-the-art LRU-based attacks on real processors. AutoCAT is the first of its kind using RL for crafting microarchitectural timing-channel attack sequences and can accelerate cache timing-channel exploration for secure microprocessor designs. ",

PDRF further uses an efficient importance sampling scheme, which results in fast scene optimization. Specifically, PDRF proposes a Coarse Ray Renderer to quickly estimate voxel density and feature; a Fine Voxel Renderer is then used to achieve high quality ray tracing.

    "abstract": "With the thriving of deep learning in processing point cloud data, recent works show that backdoor attacks pose a severe security threat to 3D vision applications. The attacker injects the backdoor into the 3D model by poisoning a few training samples with trigger, such that the backdoored model performs well on clean samples but behaves maliciously when the trigger pattern appears. Existing attacks often insert some additional points into the point cloud as the trigger, or utilize a linear transformation (e.g., rotation) to construct the poisoned point cloud. However, the effects of these poisoned samples are likely to be weakened or even eliminated by some commonly used pre-processing techniques for 3D point cloud, e.g., outlier removal or rotation augmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel imperceptible and robust backdoor attack (IRBA) to tackle this challenge. We utilize a nonlinear and local transformation, called weighted local transformation (WLT), to construct poisoned samples with unique transformations. As there are several hyper-parameters and randomness in WLT, it is difficult to produce two similar transformations. Consequently, poisoned samples with unique transformations are likely to be resistant to aforementioned pre-processing techniques. Besides, as the controllability and smoothness of the distortion caused by a fixed WLT, the generated poisoned samples are also imperceptible to human inspection. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four models show that IRBA achieves 80%+ ASR in most cases even with pre-processing techniques, which is significantly higher than previous state-of-the-art attacks.

To practice our design idea of integrating multiple orthogonal solution spaces, we leverage a simple and straightforward multi-branch neural network that eclipses adversarial attacks with no increase in inference time. We heuristically propose a corresponding loss function, branch-orthogonal loss, to make each solution space of the multi-branch model orthogonal. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN against \\ell_{\\infty} norm-bounded perturbations of size \\epsilon = 8/255, respectively. Exhaustive experiments are conducted to show that our method goes beyond all state-of-the-art methods without any tricks. Compared to all methods that do not use additional data for training, our models achieve 67.3% and 41.5% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (improving upon the state-of-the-art by +7.23% and +9.07%). We also outperform methods using a training set with a far larger scale than ours. All our models and codes are available online at https://github.com/huangd1999/BORT. ",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) in which weights and activations are both binarized into 1-bit values, thus greatly reducing the memory usage and computational complexity. Since the modern deep neural networks are of sophisticated design with complex architecture for the accuracy reason, the diversity on distributions of weights and activations is very high. Therefore, the conventional sign function cannot be well used for effectively binarizing full-precision values in BNNs. To this end, we present a simple yet effective approach called AdaBin to adaptively obtain the optimal binary sets $\\{b_1, b_2\\}$ ($b_1, b_2\\in \\mathbb{R}$) of weights and activations for each layer instead of a fixed set (i.e., $\\{-1, +1\\}$). In this way, the proposed method can better fit different distributions and increase the representation ability of binarized features. In practice, we use the center position and distance of 1-bit values to define a new binary quantization function. For the weights, we propose an equalization method to align the symmetrical center of binary distribution to real-valued distribution, and minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence of them. Meanwhile, we introduce a gradient-based optimization method to get these two parameters for activations, which are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results on benchmark models and datasets demonstrate that the proposed AdaBin is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance. For instance, we obtain a 66.4\\% Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet using ResNet-18 architecture, and a 69.4 mAP on PASCAL VOC using SSD300. ",

    "abstract": "A plethora of modern machine learning tasks require the utilization of large-scale distributed clusters as a critical component of the training pipeline. However, abnormal Byzantine behavior of the worker nodes can derail the training and compromise the quality of the inference. Such behavior can be attributed to unintentional system malfunctions or orchestrated attacks; as a result, some nodes may return arbitrary results to the parameter server (PS) that coordinates the training. Recent work considers a wide range of attack models and has explored robust aggregation and/or computational redundancy to correct the distorted gradients. In this work, we consider attack models ranging from strong ones: $q$ omniscient adversaries with full knowledge of the defense protocol that can change from iteration to iteration to weak ones: $q$ randomly chosen adversaries with limited collusion abilities which only change every few iterations at a time. Our algorithms rely on redundant task assignments coupled with detection of adversarial behavior. For strong attacks, we demonstrate a reduction in the fraction of distorted gradients ranging from 16\\%-99\\% as compared to the prior state-of-the-art. Our top-1 classification accuracy results on the CIFAR-10 data set demonstrate 25\\% advantage in accuracy (averaged over strong and weak scenarios) under the most sophisticated attacks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

During this procedure, modeling users' satisfaction status plays an essential part in improving their experiences with the systems. In this paper, we aim to explore the benefits of using Electroencephalography (EEG) signals for satisfaction modeling in interactive information access system design. Different from existing EEG classification tasks, the arisen of satisfaction involves multiple brain functions, such as arousal, prototypicality, and appraisals, which are related to different brain topographical areas. Thus modeling user satisfaction raises great challenges to existing solutions. To address this challenge, we propose BTA, a Brain Topography Adaptive network with a multi-centrality encoding module and a spatial attention mechanism module to capture cognitive connectivities in different spatial distances. We explore the effectiveness of BTA for satisfaction modeling in two popular information access scenarios, i.e., search and recommendation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of introducing brain topography adaptive strategy in satisfaction modeling. Furthermore, we also conduct search result re-ranking task and video rating prediction task based on the satisfaction inferred from brain signals on search and recommendation scenarios, respectively. Experimental results show that brain signals extracted with BTA help improve the performance of interactive information access systems significantly. ",

A fully differential framework, SuperMixer, is developed to search for an optimized activation workload assignment, adaptive to various activation energy constraints. The effectiveness of our proposed methods is evaluated on a silicon photonic accelerator.

Although several methods (e.g., differential privacy and k-anonymity) have been proposed to prevent information leakage, in recent years, tabular data synthesis models have become popular because they can well trade-off between data utility and privacy. However, recent research has shown that generative models for image data are susceptible to the membership inference attack, which can determine whether a given record was used to train a victim synthesis model. In this paper, we investigate the membership inference attack in the context of tabular data synthesis. We conduct experiments on 4 state-of-the-art tabular data synthesis models under two attack scenarios (i.e., one black-box and one white-box attack), and find that the membership inference attack can seriously jeopardize these models. We next conduct experiments to evaluate how well two popular differentially-private deep learning training algorithms, DP-SGD and DP-GAN, can protect the models against the attack. Our key finding is that both algorithms can largely alleviate this threat by sacrificing the generation quality. Code and data available at: https://github.com/JayoungKim408/MIA ",

The performances of the mainstream road detection methods are mainly determined by their extracted features, whose richness and robustness can be enhanced by fusing features of different types and cross-layer connections. However, the features in the existing mainstream model frameworks are often similar in the same layer by the single-task training, and the traditional cross-layer fusion ways are too simple to obtain an efficient effect, so more complex fusion ways besides concatenation and addition deserve to be explored. Aiming at the above defects, we propose a dual-task network (DTnet) for road detection and cross-layer graph fusion module (CGM): the DTnet consists of two parallel branches for road area and edge detection, respectively, while enhancing the feature diversity by fusing features between two branches through our designed feature bridge modules (FBM). The CGM improves the cross-layer fusion effect by a complex feature stream graph, and four graph patterns are evaluated. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our method effectively improves the final detection result. ",

The autoencoder for the joint design can be trained only in a given environment, but in an actual situation where the operating environment is constantly changing, it is difficult to optimize the preamble set for every possible environment. Therefore, a conventional, yet general approach may implement the data-aided AUD while relying on the preamble set that is designed independently rather than the joint design. In this paper, the activity detection error rate (ADER) performance of the data-aided AUD subject to the two preamble designs, i.e., independently designed preamble and jointly designed preamble, were directly compared. Fortunately, it was found that the performance loss in the data-aided AUD induced by the independent preamble design is limited to only 1dB. Furthermore, such performance characteristics of jointly designed preamble set is interpreted through average cross-correlation among the preambles associated with the same codebook (CB) (average intra-CB cross-correlation) and average cross-correlation among preambles associated with the different CBs (average inter-CB cross-correlation).

In a previous work, several semi-supervised learning strategies were designed to boost the performance of a mean-teacher model. Namely, these strategies include shift consistency training (SCT), interpolation consistency training (ICT), and pseudo-labeling. However, adversarial domain adaptation (ADA) did not seem to improve the event detection accuracy further when we attempt to compensate for the domain gap between synthetic and real data. In this research, we empirically found that ICT tends to pull apart the distributions of synthetic and real data in t-SNE plots. Therefore, ICT is abandoned while SCT, in contrast, is applied to train both the student and the teacher models. With these modifications, the system successfully integrates with an ADA network, and we achieve 47.2% in the F1 score on the DCASE 2020 task 4 dataset, which is 2.1% higher than what was reported in the previous work.

While several methods have been proposed to improve the sample efficiency of GCRL, one relatively under-studied approach is the design of neural architectures to support sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce a novel neural architecture for GCRL that achieves significantly better sample efficiency than the commonly-used monolithic network architecture. They key insight is that the optimal action value function Q^*(s, a, g) must satisfy the triangle inequality in a specific sense. Furthermore, we introduce the metric residual network (MRN) that deliberately decomposes the action-value function Q(s,a,g) into the negated summation of a metric plus a residual asymmetric component. MRN provably approximates any optimal action-value function Q^*(s,a,g), thus making it a fitting neural architecture for GCRL. We conduct comprehensive experiments across 12 standard benchmark environments in GCRL. The empirical results demonstrate that MRN uniformly outperforms other state-of-the-art GCRL neural architectures in terms of sample efficiency. ",

Existing superpixel segmentation algorithms mostly utilize color and spatial features as input, which may impose strong constraints on spatial information while utilizing the disparity information in terms of stereo image pairs. To alleviate this issue, we propose a stereo superpixel segmentation method with a decoupling mechanism of spatial information in this work. To decouple stereo disparity information and spatial information, the spatial information is temporarily removed before fusing the features of stereo image pairs, and a decoupled stereo fusion module (DSFM) is proposed to handle the stereo features alignment as well as occlusion problems. Moreover, since the spatial information is vital to superpixel segmentation, we further design a dynamic spatiality embedding module (DSEM) to re-add spatial information, and the weights of spatial information will be adaptively adjusted through the dynamic fusion (DF) mechanism in DSEM for achieving a finer segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI2015 and Cityscapes datasets, and also verify the efficiency when applied in salient object detection on NJU2K dataset.

Especially in the medical domain, where it is critical to predict the survival of a single patient, both discrimination and calibration are important performance metrics. Here we present Discrete Calibrated Survival (DCS), a novel deep neural network for discriminated and calibrated survival prediction that outperforms competing survival models in discrimination on three medical datasets, while achieving best calibration among all discrete time models. The enhanced performance of DCS can be attributed to two novel features, the variable temporal output node spacing and the novel loss term that optimizes the use of uncensored and censored patient data. We believe that DCS is an important step towards clinical application of deep-learning-based survival prediction with state-of-the-art discrimination and good calibration. ",

    "abstract": "The security and privacy of smart home systems, particularly from a home user's perspective, have been a very active research area in recent years. However, via a meta-review of 52 review papers covering related topics (published between 2000 and 2021), this paper shows a lack of a more recent literature review on user perspectives of smart home security and privacy since the 2010s. This identified gap motivated us to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) covering 126 relevant research papers published from 2010 to 2021. Our SLR led to the discovery of a number of important areas where further research is needed; these include holistic methods that consider a more diverse and heterogeneous range of home devices, interactions between multiple home users, complicated data flow between multiple home devices and home users, some less-studied demographic factors, and advanced conceptual frameworks. Based on these findings, we recommended key future research directions, e.g., research for a better understanding of security and privacy aspects in different multi-device and multi-user contexts, and a more comprehensive ontology on the security and privacy of the smart home covering varying types of home devices and behaviors of different types of home users.

    "abstract": "Graph anomaly detection on attributed networks has become a prevalent research topic due to its broad applications in many influential domains. In real-world scenarios, nodes and edges in attributed networks usually display distinct heterogeneity, i.e. attributes of different types of nodes show great variety, different types of relations represent diverse meanings. Anomalies usually perform differently from the majority in various perspectives of heterogeneity in these networks. However, existing graph anomaly detection approaches do not leverage heterogeneity in attributed networks, which is highly related to anomaly detection. In light of this problem, we propose AHEAD: a heterogeneity-aware unsupervised graph anomaly detection approach based on the encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, for the encoder, we design three levels of attention, i.e. attribute level, node type level, and edge level attentions to capture the heterogeneity of network structure, node properties and information of a single node, respectively. In the decoder, we exploit structure, attribute, and node type reconstruction terms to obtain an anomaly score for each node. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AHEAD on several real-world heterogeneous information networks compared with the state-of-arts in the unsupervised setting. Further experiments verify the effectiveness and robustness of our triple attention, model backbone, and decoder in general. ",

    "abstract": "The node-averaged complexity of a distributed algorithm running on a graph $G=(V,E)$ is the average over the times at which the nodes $V$ of $G$ finish their computation and commit to their outputs. We study the node-averaged complexity for some distributed symmetry breaking problems and provide the following results (among others): - The randomized node-averaged complexity of computing a maximal independent set (MIS) in $n$-node graphs of maximum degree $\\Delta$ is at least $\\Omega\\big(\\min\\big\\{\\frac{\\log\\Delta}{\\log\\log\\Delta},\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}}\\big\\}\\big)$. This bound is obtained by a novel adaptation of the well-known KMW lower bound [JACM'16]. As a side result, we obtain the same lower bound for the worst-case randomized round complexity for computing an MIS in trees -- this essentially answers open problem 11.15 in the book of Barenboim and Elkin and resolves the complexity of MIS on trees up to an $O(\\sqrt{\\log\\log n})$ factor. We also show that, $(2,2)$-ruling sets, which are a minimal relaxation of MIS, have $O(1)$ randomized node-averaged complexity. - For maximal matching, we show that while the randomized node-averaged complexity is $\\Omega\\big(\\min\\big\\{\\frac{\\log\\Delta}{\\log\\log\\Delta},\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n}}\\big\\}\\big)$, the randomized edge-averaged complexity is $O(1)$. Further, we show that the deterministic edge-averaged complexity of maximal matching is $O(\\log^2\\Delta + \\log^* n)$ and the deterministic node-averaged complexity of maximal matching is $O(\\log^3\\Delta + \\log^* n)$. - Finally, we consider the problem of computing a sinkless orientation of a graph. The deterministic worst-case complexity of the problem is known to be $\\Theta(\\log n)$, even on bounded-degree graphs. We show that the problem can be solved deterministically with node-averaged complexity $O(\\log^* n)$, while keeping the worst-case complexity in $O(\\log n)$. ",

    "abstract": "Supervised representation learning with deep networks tends to overfit the training classes and the generalization to novel classes is a challenging question. It is common to evaluate a learned embedding on held-out images of the same training classes. In real applications however, data comes from new sources and novel classes are likely to arise. We hypothesize that incorporating unlabelled images of novel classes in the training set in a semi-supervised fashion would be beneficial for the efficient retrieval of novel-class images compared to a vanilla supervised representation. To verify this hypothesis in a comprehensive way, we propose an original evaluation methodology that varies the degree of novelty of novel classes by partitioning the dataset category-wise either randomly, or semantically, i.e. by minimizing the shared semantics between base and novel classes. This evaluation procedure allows to train a representation blindly to any novel-class labels and evaluate the frozen representation on the retrieval of base or novel classes. We find that a vanilla supervised representation falls short on the retrieval of novel classes even more so when the semantics gap is higher. Semi-supervised algorithms allow to partially bridge this performance gap but there is still much room for improvement. ",

Therefore, accidents caused by these heavy vehicles are more fatal and result in severe injuries to other road users. These possible blind-spot collisions can be identified early using vision-based object detection approaches. Yet, the existing state-of-the-art vision-based object detection models rely heavily on a single feature descriptor for making decisions. In this research, the design of two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on high-level feature descriptors and their integration with faster R-CNN is proposed to detect blind-spot collisions for heavy vehicles. Moreover, a fusion approach is proposed to integrate two pre-trained networks (i.e., Resnet 50 and Resnet 101) for extracting high level features for blind-spot vehicle detection. The fusion of features significantly improves the performance of faster R-CNN and outperformed the existing state-of-the-art methods. Both approaches are validated on a self-recorded blind-spot vehicle detection dataset for buses and an online LISA dataset for vehicle detection. For both proposed approaches, a false detection rate (FDR) of 3.05% and 3.49% are obtained for the self recorded dataset, making these approaches suitable for real time applications. ",

It either expands its scope, in which case it sets positive precedent, or it narrows it down, in which case it sets negative precedent. While legal outcome prediction, which is nothing other than the prediction of positive precedents, is an increasingly popular task in AI, we are the first to investigate negative precedent prediction by focusing on negative outcomes. We discover an asymmetry in existing models' ability to predict positive and negative outcomes. Where state-of-the-art outcome prediction models predicts positive outcomes at 75.06 F1, they predicts negative outcomes at only 10.09 F1, worse than a random baseline. To address this performance gap, we develop two new models inspired by the dynamics of a court process. Our first model significantly improves positive outcome prediction score to 77.15 F1 and our second model more than doubles the negative outcome prediction performance to 24.01 F1. Despite this improvement, shifting focus to negative outcomes reveals that there is still plenty of room to grow when it comes to modelling law. ",

However, patients are hesitant to undergo OFCs, and for those that do, there is limited access to allergists in rural/community healthcare settings. The prediction of OFC outcomes through machine learning methods can facilitate the de-labeling of food allergens at home, improve patient and physician comfort during OFCs, and economize medical resources by minimizing the number of OFCs performed. Clinical data was gathered from 1,112 patients who collectively underwent a total of 1,284 OFCs, and consisted of clinical factors including serum specific IgE, total IgE, skin prick tests (SPTs), symptoms, sex, and age. Using these clinical features, machine learning models were constructed to predict outcomes for peanut, egg, and milk challenge. The best performing model for each allergen was created using the Learning Using Concave and Convex Kernels (LUCCK) method, which achieved an Area under the Curve (AUC) for peanut, egg, and milk OFC prediction of 0.76, 0.68, and 0.70, respectively. Model interpretation via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) indicate that specific IgE, along with wheal and flare values from SPTs, are highly predictive of OFC outcomes. The results of this analysis suggest that machine learning has the potential to predict OFC outcomes and reveal relevant clinical factors for further study. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning poses severe privacy concerns as it is shown that the learned models can reveal sensitive information about their training data. Many works have investigated the effect of widely-adopted data augmentation (DA) and adversarial training (AT) techniques, termed data enhancement in the paper, on the privacy leakage of machine learning models. Such privacy effects are often measured by membership inference attacks (MIAs), which aim to identify whether a particular example belongs to the training set or not. We propose to investigate privacy from a new perspective called memorization. Through the lens of memorization, we find that previously deployed MIAs produce misleading results as they are less likely to identify samples with higher privacy risks as members compared to samples with low privacy risks. To solve this problem, we deploy a recent attack that can capture the memorization degrees of individual samples for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we unveil non-trivial findings about the connections between three important properties of machine learning models, including privacy, generalization gap, and adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that, unlike existing results, the generalization gap is shown not highly correlated with privacy leakage. Moreover, stronger adversarial robustness does not necessarily imply that the model is more susceptible to privacy attacks. ",

To date, visible LLM-based code completion frameworks like GitHub Copilot and GPT are trained using deep learning over vast quantities of unstructured text and open source codes. As the paramount component and the cornerstone in daily programming tasks, code completion has largely boosted professionals' efficiency in building real-world software systems. In contrast to this flourishing market, we find that code completion models often output suspicious results, and to date, an automated testing and enhancement framework for code completion models is not available. This research proposes CCTEST, a framework to test and repair code completion systems in blackbox settings. CCTEST features a novel mutation strategy, namely program structure-consistency (PSC) mutations, to generate mutated code completion inputs. Then, it detects inconsistent outputs, representing likely erroneous cases, from all the completed code cases. Moreover, CCTEST repairs the code completion outputs by selecting the output that mostly reflects the \"average\" appearance of all output cases, as the final output of the code completion systems. We detected a total of 33,540 inputs that can trigger likely erroneous cases from eight popular LLM-based code completion systems. With repairing, we show that the performance of code completion models notably increased by 53.51% on average. ",

    "abstract": "Remote sensing image change detection is of great importance in disaster assessment and urban planning. The mainstream method is to use encoder-decoder models to detect the change region of two input images. Since the change content of remote sensing images has the characteristics of wide scale range and variety, it is necessary to improve the detection accuracy of the network by increasing the attention mechanism, which commonly includes: Squeeze-and-Excitation block, Non-local and Convolutional Block Attention Module, among others. These methods consider the importance of different location features between channels or within channels, but fail to perceive the differences between input images. In this paper, we propose a novel image difference attention network (IDAN). In the image preprocessing stage, we use a pre-training model to extract the feature differences between two input images to obtain the feature difference map (FD-map), and Canny for edge detection to obtain the edge difference map (ED-map). In the image feature extracting stage, the FD-map and ED-map are input to the feature difference attention module and edge compensation module, respectively, to optimize the features extracted by IDAN. Finally, the change detection result is obtained through the feature difference operation. IDAN comprehensively considers the differences in regional and edge features of images and thus optimizes the extracted image features. The experimental results demonstrate that the F1-score of IDAN improves 1.62% and 1.98% compared to the baseline model on WHU dataset and LEVIR-CD dataset, respectively. ",

The inherently ill-posed nature of the problem makes it even more challenging since the outputs could be multi-modal. The learning-based methods currently in use produce acceptable results for straightforward cases but usually fail to restore the contextual information in the absence of clear figure-ground separation. Also, the images suffer from color bleeding and desaturated backgrounds since a single model trained on full image features is insufficient for learning the diverse data modes. To address these issues, we present a parallel GAN-based colorization framework. In our approach, each separately tailored GAN pipeline colorizes the foreground (using object-level features) or the background (using full-image features). The foreground pipeline employs a Residual-UNet with self-attention as its generator trained using the full-image features and the corresponding object-level features from the COCO dataset. The background pipeline relies on full-image features and additional training examples from the Places dataset. We design a DenseFuse-based fusion network to obtain the final colorized image by feature-based fusion of the parallelly generated outputs. We show the shortcomings of the non-perceptual evaluation metrics commonly used to assess multi-modal problems like image colorization and perform extensive performance evaluation of our framework using multiple perceptual metrics. Our approach outperforms most of the existing learning-based methods and produces results comparable to the state-of-the-art. Further, we performed a runtime analysis and obtained an average inference time of 24ms per image. ",

In light of our analysis, we propose a novel position-aware graph structure learning framework named PASTEL, which directly optimizes the information propagation path and solves the topology-imbalance issue in essence. Our key insight is to enhance the connectivity of nodes within the same class for more supervision information, thereby relieving the under-reaching and over-squashing phenomena. Specifically, we design an anchor-based position encoding mechanism, which better incorporates relative topology position and enhances the intra-class inductive bias by maximizing the label influence. We further propose a class-wise conflict measure as the edge weights, which benefits the separation of different node classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior potential and adaptability of PASTEL in enhancing GNNs' power in different data annotation scenarios. ",

However, hardly a method has made text and graph modality deeply fused and interacted to leverage both advantages and learn the relative importance of the two modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel model named BIC that makes the text and graph modalities deeply interactive and detects tweet semantic inconsistency. Specifically, BIC contains a text propagation module, a graph propagation module to conduct bot detection respectively on text and graph structure, and a proven effective text-graph interactive module to make the two interact. Besides, BIC contains a semantic consistency detection module to learn semantic consistency information from tweets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms competitive baselines on a comprehensive Twitter bot benchmark.

    "abstract": "We propose a new kind of embedding for natural language text that deeply represents semantic meaning. Standard text embeddings use the vector output of a pretrained language model. In our method, we let a language model learn from the text and then literally pick its brain, taking the actual weights of the model's neurons to generate a vector. We call this representation of the text a neural embedding. The technique may generalize beyond text and language models, but we first explore its properties for natural language processing. We compare neural embeddings with GPT sentence (SGPT) embeddings on several datasets. We observe that neural embeddings achieve comparable performance with a far smaller model, and the errors are different. ",

And Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction is at the heart of any PHM system. Most recent data-driven research demand substantial volumes of labelled training data before a performant model can be trained under the supervised learning paradigm. This is where Transfer Learning (TL) and Domain Adaptation (DA) methods step in and make it possible for us to generalize a supervised model to other domains with different data distributions with no labelled data. In this paper, we propose \\textit{LAMA-Net}, an encoder-decoder based model (Transformer) with an induced bottleneck, Latent Alignment using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and manifold learning is proposed to tackle the problem of Unsupervised Homogeneous Domain Adaptation for RUL prediction. \\textit{LAMA-Net} is validated using the C-MAPSS Turbofan Engine dataset by NASA and compared against other state-of-the-art techniques for DA. The results suggest that the proposed method offers a promising approach to perform domain adaptation in RUL prediction. Code will be made available once the paper comes out of review. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we address sorting networks that are constructed from comparators of arity $k > 2$. That is, in our setting the arity of the comparators -- or, in other words, the number of inputs that can be sorted at the unit cost -- is a parameter. We study its relationship with two other parameters -- $n$, the number of inputs, and $d$, the depth. This model received considerable attention. Partly, its motivation is to better understand the structure of sorting networks. In particular, sorting networks with large arity are related to recursive constructions of ordinary sorting networks. Additionally, studies of this model have natural correspondence with a recent line of work on constructing circuits for majority functions from majority gates of lower fan-in. Motivated by these questions, we obtain the first lower bounds on the arity of constant-depth sorting networks. More precisely, we consider sorting networks of depth $d$ up to 4, and determine the minimal $k$ for which there is such a network with comparators of arity $k$. For depths $d=1,2$ we observe that $k=n$. For $d=3$ we show that $k = \\lceil \\frac n2 \\rceil$. For $d=4$ the minimal arity becomes sublinear: $k = \\Theta(n^{2/3})$. This contrasts with the case of majority circuits, in which $k = O(n^{2/3})$ is achievable already for depth $d=3$. ",

    "abstract": "Depth estimation is a crucial step for image-guided intervention in robotic surgery and laparoscopic imaging system. Since per-pixel depth ground truth is difficult to acquire for laparoscopic image data, it is rarely possible to apply supervised depth estimation to surgical applications. As an alternative, self-supervised methods have been introduced to train depth estimators using only synchronized stereo image pairs. However, most recent work focused on the left-right consistency in 2D and ignored valuable inherent 3D information on the object in real world coordinates, meaning that the left-right 3D geometric structural consistency is not fully utilized. To overcome this limitation, we present M3Depth, a self-supervised depth estimator to leverage 3D geometric structural information hidden in stereo pairs while keeping monocular inference. The method also removes the influence of border regions unseen in at least one of the stereo images via masking, to enhance the correspondences between left and right images in overlapping areas. Intensive experiments show that our method outperforms previous self-supervised approaches on both a public dataset and a newly acquired dataset by a large margin, indicating a good generalization across different samples and laparoscopes.

    "abstract": "Certain new ascendant data center workloads can absorb some degradation in network service, not needing fully reliable data transport and/or their fair-share of network bandwidth. This opens up opportunities for superior network and infrastructure multiplexing by having this flexible traffic cede capacity under congestion to regular traffic with stricter needs. We posit there is opportunity in network service primitives which permit degradation within certain bounds, such that flexible traffic still receives an acceptable level of service, while benefiting from its weaker requirements. We propose two primitives, namely guaranteed partial delivery and bounded deprioritization. We design a budgeting algorithm to provide guarantees relative to their fair share, which is measured via probing. The requirement of budgeting and probing limits the algorithm's applicability to large flexible flows. We evaluate our algorithm with large flexible flows and for three workloads of regular flows of small size, large size and a distribution of sizes. Across the workloads, our algorithm achieves less speed-up of regular flows than fixed prioritization, especially for the small flows workload (1.25x vs. 6.82 in the 99th %-tile). Our algorithm provides better guarantees in the workload with large regular flows (with 14.5% vs. 32.5% of flexible flows being slowed down beyond their guarantee). However, it provides not much better or even slightly worse guarantees for the other two workloads. The ability to enforce guarantees is influenced by flow fair share interdependence, measurement inaccuracies and dependency on convergence. We observe that priority changes to probe or to deprioritize causes queue shifts which deteriorate guarantees and limit possible speed-up, especially of small flows. We find that mechanisms to both prioritize traffic and track guarantees should be as non-disruptive as possible. ",

Typically, the constrained RMPC problem with state-feedback parameterizations is nonlinear (and nonconvex) with a prohibitively high computational burden for online implementation. To remedy this, a novel approach is proposed to linearize the state-feedback RMPC problem, with minimal conservatism, through the use of semidefinite relaxation techniques. The proposed algorithm computes the state-feedback gain and perturbation online by solving a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization that, in comparison to other schemes in the literature is shown to have a substantially reduced computational burden without adversely affecting the tracking performance of the controller. Additionally, an offline strategy that provides initial feasibility on the RMPC problem is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through numerical examples from the literature. ",

    "abstract": "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a problem of interpreting sensor data to human movement using an efficient machine learning (ML) approach. The HAR systems rely on data from untrusted users, making them susceptible to data poisoning attacks. In a poisoning attack, attackers manipulate the sensor readings to contaminate the training set, misleading the HAR to produce erroneous outcomes. This paper presents the design of a label flipping data poisoning attack for a HAR system, where the label of a sensor reading is maliciously changed in the data collection phase. Due to high noise and uncertainty in the sensing environment, such an attack poses a severe threat to the recognition system. Besides, vulnerability to label flipping attacks is dangerous when activity recognition models are deployed in safety-critical applications. This paper shades light on how to carry out the attack in practice through smartphone-based sensor data collection applications. This is an earlier research work, to our knowledge, that explores attacking the HAR models via label flipping poisoning. We implement the proposed attack and test it on activity recognition models based on the following machine learning algorithms: multi-layer perceptron, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of K-nearest neighbors (KNN)-based defense mechanism against the proposed attack. ",

Moreover, our method can reduce both random errors and biases, whereas existing methods can only reduce random errors in the estimation of treatment effects. Through numerical experiments on both artificial and real-world data, we confirmed that our method can lead to better estimation results than individual analyses.

Furthermore, when the COVID-19 pandemic started, conversations related to working from home, switching jobs, work-related distress, and mental health increased. We distinguish between general work-related and specific quit-related discourse changes using a difference-in-differences method. Our main finding is that mental health and work-related distress topics disproportionally increased among quit-related posts since the onset of the pandemic, likely contributing to the Great Resignation. Along with better labor market conditions, some relief came beginning-to-mid-2021 when these concerns decreased.

In addition, a hybrid classical-quantum approach is explored by using an ensemble model that combines classical and quantum algorithms to better improve the fraud prevention decision. We found, as expected, that the results highly depend on feature selections and algorithms that are used to select them. The QSVM provides a complementary exploration of the feature space which led to an improved accuracy of the mixed quantum-classical method for fraud detection, on a drastically reduced data set to fit current state of Quantum Hardware.

In this paper, we propose an explicit disentanglement framework to unravel speaker-relevant features from speaker-unrelated features via mutual information (MI) minimization. To achieve our goal of minimizing MI between speaker-related and speaker-unrelated features, we adopt a contrastive log-ratio upper bound (CLUB), which exploits the upper bound of MI. Our framework is constructed in a 3-stage structure. First, in the front-end encoder, input speech is encoded into shared initial embedding. Next, in the decoupling block, shared initial embedding is split into separate speaker-related and speaker-unrelated embeddings. Finally, disentanglement is conducted by MI minimization in the last stage. Experiments on Far-Field Speaker Verification Challenge 2022 (FFSVC2022) demonstrate that our proposed framework is effective for disentanglement. Also, to utilize domain-unknown datasets containing numerous speakers, we pre-trained the front-end encoder with VoxCeleb datasets. We then fine-tuned the speaker embedding model in the disentanglement framework with FFSVC 2022 dataset. The experimental results show that fine-tuning with a disentanglement framework on a existing pre-trained model is valid and can further improve performance. ",

However, due to the directional nature and the line-of-sight demand of THz links, as well as the ultra-dense deployment of THz networks, a number of challenges that the medium access control (MAC) layer needs to face are created. In more detail, the need of rethinking user association and resource allocation strategies by incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) capable of providing \"real-time\" solutions in complex and frequently changing environments becomes evident. Moreover, to satisfy the ultra-reliability and low-latency demands of several B5G applications, novel mobility management approaches are required. Motivated by this, this article presents a holistic MAC layer approach that enables intelligent user association and resource allocation, as well as flexible and adaptive mobility management, while maximizing systems' reliability through blockage minimization. In more detail, a fast and centralized joint user association, radio resource allocation, and blockage avoidance by means of a novel metaheuristic-machine learning framework is documented, that maximizes the THz networks performance, while minimizing the association latency by approximately three orders of magnitude. To support, within the access point (AP) coverage area, mobility management and blockage avoidance, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for beam-selection is discussed. Finally, to support user mobility between coverage areas of neighbor APs, a proactive hand-over mechanism based on AI-assisted fast channel prediction is~reported. ",

In the first stage, known as model selection, relevant predictors are locally selected by applying robust Lasso estimators to the distinct subsets of data. The variable selections from each computation node are then fused by a voting scheme to find the sparse basis for the complete data set. It identifies the relevant variables in a robust manner. In the second stage, the developed statistically robust and computationally efficient bootstrap methods are employed. The actual inference constructs confidence intervals, finds parameter estimates and quantifies standard deviation. Similar to stage 1, the results of local inference are communicated to the fusion center and combined there. By using analytical methods, we establish the favorable statistical properties of the robust and computationally efficient bootstrap methods including consistency for a fixed number of predictors, and robustness. The proposed two-stage robust and distributed inference procedures demonstrate reliable performance and robustness in variable selection, finding confidence intervals and bootstrap approximations of standard deviations even when data is high-dimensional and contaminated by outliers.

Further, it guarantees the convergence of the underlying algorithms. Some preliminary analysis based on distance geometry seems to support that the optimal step size parameter has a high probability of 1 when graphs are fully connected. Secondly, it is observed that a popular projection method, softassign, is sensitive to graphs' cardinality(size). We proposed a dynamical softassign algorithm that is robust to graphs' cardinality. Combining the adaptive step size and the dynamical softassign, we propose a novel graph matching algorithm: the adaptive projected fixed-point method with dynamical softassign.

While most previous approaches to causal discovery have implicitly assumed that no expert domain knowledge is available, practitioners can often provide such domain knowledge from prior experience. Recent work has incorporated domain knowledge into constraint-based causal discovery. The majority of such constraint-based methods, however, assume causal faithfulness, which has been shown to be frequently violated in practice. Consequently, there has been renewed attention towards exact-search score-based causal discovery methods, which do not assume causal faithfulness, such as A*-based methods. However, there has been no consideration of these methods in the context of domain knowledge. In this work, we focus on efficiently integrating several types of domain knowledge into A*-based causal discovery. In doing so, we discuss and explain how domain knowledge can reduce the graph search space and then provide an analysis of the potential computational gains. We support these findings with experiments on synthetic and real data, showing that even small amounts of domain knowledge can dramatically speed up A*-based causal discovery and improve its performance and practicality.

QMS22 tackles SSAD by solving a multi-class classification problem involving both the training set and the test set of the original problem. The classification problem intentionally includes classes with overlapping samples. One of the classes contains mixture of normal samples and outliers, and all other classes contain only normal samples. An outlier score is then calculated for every sample in the test set using the outcome of the classification problem. We also include performance evaluation of QMS22 against top performing classifiers using ninety-five benchmark imbalanced datasets from the KEEL repository. These classifiers are BRM (Bagging-Random Miner), OCKRA (One-Class K-means with Randomly-projected features Algorithm), ISOF (Isolation Forest), and ocSVM (One-Class Support Vector Machine). It is shown by using the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve as the performance measure, QMS22 significantly outperforms ISOF and ocSVM.

    "abstract": "Frequency-domain simulation of seismic waves plays an important role in seismic inversion, but it remains challenging in large models. The recently proposed physics-informed neural network (PINN), as an effective deep learning method, has achieved successful applications in solving a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs), and there is still room for improvement on this front. For example, PINN can lead to inaccurate solutions when PDE coefficients are non-smooth and describe structurally-complex media. In this paper, we solve the acoustic and visco-acoustic scattered-field wave equation in the frequency domain with PINN instead of the wave equation to remove source singularity. We first illustrate that non-smooth velocity models lead to inaccurate wavefields when no boundary conditions are implemented in the loss function. Then, we add the perfectly matched layer (PML) conditions in the loss function of PINN and design a quadratic neural network to overcome the detrimental effects of non-smooth models in PINN. We show that PML and quadratic neurons improve the results as well as attenuation and discuss the reason for this improvement. We also illustrate that a network trained during a wavefield simulation can be used to pre-train the neural network of another wavefield simulation after PDE-coefficient alteration and improve the convergence speed accordingly. This pre-training strategy should find application in iterative full waveform inversion (FWI) and time-lag target-oriented imaging when the model perturbation between two consecutive iterations or two consecutive experiments can be small.

    "title": "Conformal Inference for Online Prediction with Arbitrary Distribution  Shifts",
    "abstract": "Conformal inference is a flexible methodology for transforming the predictions made by any black-box model (e.g. neural nets, random forests) into valid prediction sets. The only necessary assumption is that the training and test data be exchangeable (e.g. i.i.d.). Unfortunately, this assumption is usually unrealistic in online environments in which the processing generating the data may vary in time and consecutive data-points are often temporally correlated. In this article, we develop an online algorithm for producing prediction intervals that are robust to these deviations. Our methods build upon conformal inference and thus can be combined with any black-box predictor. We show that the coverage error of our algorithm is controlled by the size of the underlying change in the environment and thus directly connect the size of the distribution shift with the difficulty of the prediction problem. Finally, we apply our procedure in two real-world settings and find that our method produces robust prediction intervals under real-world dynamics. ",
