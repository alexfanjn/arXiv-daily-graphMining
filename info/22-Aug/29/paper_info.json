    "title": "Augmenting Reinforcement Learning with Transformer-based Scene  Representation Learning for Decision-making of Autonomous Driving",
    "abstract": "Decision-making for urban autonomous driving is challenging due to the stochastic nature of interactive traffic participants and the complexity of road structures. Although reinforcement learning (RL)-based decision-making scheme is promising to handle urban driving scenarios, it suffers from low sample efficiency and poor adaptability. In this paper, we propose Scene-Rep Transformer to improve the RL decision-making capabilities with better scene representation encoding and sequential predictive latent distillation. Specifically, a multi-stage Transformer (MST) encoder is constructed to model not only the interaction awareness between the ego vehicle and its neighbors but also intention awareness between the agents and their candidate routes. A sequential latent Transformer (SLT) with self-supervised learning objectives is employed to distill the future predictive information into the latent scene representation, in order to reduce the exploration space and speed up training. The final decision-making module based on soft actor-critic (SAC) takes as input the refined latent scene representation from the Scene-Rep Transformer and outputs driving actions. The framework is validated in five challenging simulated urban scenarios with dense traffic, and its performance is manifested quantitatively by the substantial improvements in data efficiency and performance in terms of success rate, safety, and efficiency. The qualitative results reveal that our framework is able to extract the intentions of neighbor agents to help make decisions and deliver more diversified driving behaviors. ",

    "title": "Learning Continuous Implicit Representation for Near-Periodic Patterns",
    "abstract": "Near-Periodic Patterns (NPP) are ubiquitous in man-made scenes and are composed of tiled motifs with appearance differences caused by lighting, defects, or design elements. A good NPP representation is useful for many applications including image completion, segmentation, and geometric remapping. But representing NPP is challenging because it needs to maintain global consistency (tiled motifs layout) while preserving local variations (appearance differences). Methods trained on general scenes using a large dataset or single-image optimization struggle to satisfy these constraints, while methods that explicitly model periodicity are not robust to periodicity detection errors. To address these challenges, we learn a neural implicit representation using a coordinate-based MLP with single image optimization. We design an input feature warping module and a periodicity-guided patch loss to handle both global consistency and local variations. To further improve the robustness, we introduce a periodicity proposal module to search and use multiple candidate periodicities in our pipeline. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on more than 500 images of building facades, friezes, wallpapers, ground, and Mondrian patterns on single and multi-planar scenes. ",

Unlike in DSLR cameras, this effect can not be captured directly in mobile cameras due to the physical constraints of the mobile aperture. We thus propose a network-based approach that is capable of rendering realistic monocular bokeh from single image inputs. To do this, we introduce three new edge-aware Bokeh Losses based on a predicted monocular depth map, that sharpens the foreground edges while blurring the background. This model is then finetuned using an adversarial loss to generate a realistic Bokeh effect. Experimental results show that our approach is capable of generating a pleasing, natural Bokeh effect with sharp edges while handling complicated scenes. ",

    "abstract": "Property inference attacks allow an adversary to extract global properties of the training dataset from a machine learning model. Such attacks have privacy implications for data owners who share their datasets to train machine learning models. Several existing approaches for property inference attacks against deep neural networks have been proposed, but they all rely on the attacker training a large number of shadow models, which induces large computational overhead. In this paper, we consider the setting of property inference attacks in which the attacker can poison a subset of the training dataset and query the trained target model. Motivated by our theoretical analysis of model confidences under poisoning, we design an efficient property inference attack, SNAP, which obtains higher attack success and requires lower amounts of poisoning than the state-of-the-art poisoning-based property inference attack by Mahloujifar et al. For example, on the Census dataset, SNAP achieves 34% higher success rate than Mahloujifar et al. while being 56.5x faster. We also extend our attack to determine if a certain property is present at all in training, and estimate the exact proportion of a property of interest efficiently. We evaluate our attack on several properties of varying proportions from four datasets, and demonstrate SNAP's generality and effectiveness. ",

Existing technological defenses, such as unlock authentication or account switching, have proven to be unpopular. We conducted interviews to uncover practices users currently engage in to cope with the threat, and found that it is common for users to try to keep their devices under close supervision at all times. One obstacle to this strategy is that displaying such protective behavior can be detrimental to social relationships. To address these concerns, we built a software tool that gathers activity logs in the background. Logs can later be reviewed as a timeline of opened apps and the actions performed within each, with events decorated with pictures captured inconspicuously with the front-facing camera. We evaluated this approach in a user study, and found participants to be generally eager to adopt the technology, although in different ways. Most users foresaw using it as a deterrent, or to check if they were snooped on, if that suspicion were ever to arise. Yet, some voiced the intention of creating \"honey traps\". The results highlight both the opportunities and the potential dangers of the logging approach. ",

    "abstract": "Achieving high performance for GPU codes requires developers to have significant knowledge in parallel programming and GPU architectures, and in-depth understanding of the application. This combination makes it challenging to find performance optimizations for GPU-based applications, especially in scientific computing. This paper shows that significant speedups can be achieved on two quite different scientific workloads using the tool, GEVO, to improve performance over human-optimized GPU code. GEVO uses evolutionary computation to find code edits that improve the runtime of a multiple sequence alignment kernel and a SARS-CoV-2 simulation by 28.9% and 29% respectively. Further, when GEVO begins with an early, unoptimized version of the sequence alignment program, it finds an impressive 30 times speedup -- a performance improvement similar to that of the hand-tuned version. This work presents an in-depth analysis of the discovered optimizations, revealing that the primary sources of improvement vary across applications; that most of the optimizations generalize across GPU architectures; and that several of the most important optimizations involve significant code interdependencies. The results showcase the potential of automated program optimization tools to help reduce the optimization burden for scientific computing developers and enhance performance portability for domain-specific accelerators.

While many OOD algorithms perform well in various scenarios, these systems are evaluated as ``black-boxes''. Instead, we propose a flexible framework that evaluates OOD systems with finer granularity using a probing module that predicts the originating domain from intermediate representations. We find that representations always encode some information about the domain. While the layerwise encoding patterns remain largely stable across different OOD algorithms, they vary across the datasets. For example, the information about rotation (on RotatedMNIST) is the most visible on the lower layers, while the information about style (on VLCS and PACS) is the most visible on the middle layers. In addition, the high probing results correlate to the domain generalization performances, leading to further directions in developing OOD generalization systems. ",

Writing a correct transformation program requires to be proficient with the source and target modeling languages, to have a clear understanding of the mapping between the elements of the two, as well as to master the transformation language to properly describe the transformation. Transformation programs are thus complex and error-prone, and finding and fixing errors in such programs typically involve a tedious and time-consuming effort by developers. In this paper, we propose a novel search-based approach to automatically repair transformation programs containing many semantic errors. To prevent the fitness plateaus and the single fitness peak limitations, we leverage the notion of social diversity to promote repair patches tackling errors that are less covered by the other patches of the population. We evaluate our approach on 71 semantically incorrect transformation programs written in ATL, and containing up to five semantic errors simultaneously. The evaluation shows that integrating social diversity when searching for repair patches allows to improve the quality of those patches and to speed up the convergence even when up to five semantic errors are involved.

We construct these compact subsets from the unstructured data using a combination of abstractive summaries and extractive keywords. In particular, we rely on BART to generate abstractive summaries, and KeyBERT to extract keywords from these summaries (or the original unstructured text directly). We evaluate our approach using six different settings: three datasets combined with two distinct NLMs. Our results reveal that the task-specific classifiers trained on top of NLMs pretrained using our method outperform methods based on traditional pretraining, i.e., random masking on the entire data, as well as methods without pretraining. Further, we show that our strategy reduces pretraining time by up to five times compared to vanilla pretraining.

For example, the recommender systems can recommend a battery charger to a user after buying a phone, in which the latter can serve as the cause of the former, and such a causal relation cannot be reversed. Recently, to address it, researchers in recommender systems have begun to utilize causal inference to extract causality, enhancing the recommender system. In this survey, we comprehensively review the literature on causal inference-based recommendation. At first, we present the fundamental concepts of both recommendation and causal inference as the basis of later content. We raise the typical issues that the non-causality recommendation is faced. Afterward, we comprehensively review the existing work of causal inference-based recommendation, based on a taxonomy of what kind of problem causal inference addresses.

Contrary to the previous signal processing-based methods, which require high-quality singing templates or phoneme synchronization, we explore a data-driven approach for the problem of converting natural speech to singing voice. We develop a novel neural network architecture, called SymNet, which models the alignment of the input speech with the target melody while preserving the speaker identity and naturalness. The proposed SymNet model is comprised of symmetrical stack of three types of layers - convolutional, transformer, and self-attention layers. The paper also explores novel data augmentation and generative loss annealing methods to facilitate the model training. Experiments are performed on the NUS and NHSS datasets which consist of parallel data of speech and singing voice. In these experiments, we show that the proposed SymNet model improves the objective reconstruction quality significantly over the previously published methods and baseline architectures. Further, a subjective listening test confirms the improved quality of the audio obtained using the proposed approach (absolute improvement of 0.37 in mean opinion score measure over the baseline system).

    "abstract": "Arbitrary shape text detection is a challenging task due to the significantly varied sizes and aspect ratios, arbitrary orientations or shapes, inaccurate annotations, etc. Due to the scalability of pixel-level prediction, segmentation-based methods can adapt to various shape texts and hence attracted considerable attention recently. However, accurate pixel-level annotations of texts are formidable, and the existing datasets for scene text detection only provide coarse-grained boundary annotations. Consequently, numerous misclassified text pixels or background pixels inside annotations always exist, degrading the performance of segmentation-based text detection methods. Generally speaking, whether a pixel belongs to text or not is highly related to the distance with the adjacent annotation boundary. With this observation, in this paper, we propose an innovative and robust segmentation-based detection method via probability maps for accurately detecting text instances. To be concrete, we adopt a Sigmoid Alpha Function (SAF) to transfer the distances between boundaries and their inside pixels to a probability map. However, one probability map can not cover complex probability distributions well because of the uncertainty of coarse-grained text boundary annotations. Therefore, we adopt a group of probability maps computed by a series of Sigmoid Alpha Functions to describe the possible probability distributions. In addition, we propose an iterative model to learn to predict and assimilate probability maps for providing enough information to reconstruct text instances. Finally, simple region growth algorithms are adopted to aggregate probability maps to complete text instances. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of detection accuracy on several benchmarks. ",

When only few labeled nodes are available, how to develop highly effective GNNs remains understudied. Though self-training has been shown to be powerful for semi-supervised learning, its application on graph-structured data may fail because (1) larger receptive fields are not leveraged to capture long-range node interactions, which exacerbates the difficulty of propagating feature-label patterns from labeled nodes to unlabeled nodes; and (2) limited labeled data makes it challenging to learn well-separated decision boundaries for different node classes without explicitly capturing the underlying semantic structure. To address the challenges of capturing informative structural and semantic knowledge, we propose a new graph data augmentation framework, AGST (Augmented Graph Self-Training), which is built with two new (i.e., structural and semantic) augmentation modules on top of a decoupled GST backbone. In this work, we investigate whether this novel framework can learn an effective graph predictive model with extremely limited labeled nodes. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on semi-supervised node classification under different scenarios of limited labeled-node data. The experimental results demonstrate the unique contributions of the novel data augmentation framework for node classification with few labeled data. ",

This is especially seen in medical domains where dense pixel-level annotations are expensive to obtain. In this paper, we propose Regularized Prototypical Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (R-PNODE), a method that leverages intrinsic properties of Neural-ODEs, assisted and enhanced by additional cluster and consistency losses to perform Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) of organs. R-PNODE constrains support and query features from the same classes to lie closer in the representation space thereby improving the performance over the existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based FSS methods. We further demonstrate that while many existing Deep CNN based methods tend to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks, R-PNODE exhibits increased adversarial robustness for a wide array of these attacks. We experiment with three publicly available multi-organ segmentation datasets in both in-domain and cross-domain FSS settings to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. In addition, we perform experiments with seven commonly used adversarial attacks in various settings to demonstrate R-PNODE's robustness. R-PNODE outperforms the baselines for FSS by significant margins and also shows superior performance for a wide array of attacks varying in intensity and design. ",

Nevertheless, how to model and utilize this information remains a challenging problem for self-supervised 3D action representation learning. In this work, we formulate the cross-modal interaction as a bidirectional knowledge distillation problem. Different from classic distillation solutions that transfer the knowledge of a fixed and pre-trained teacher to the student, in this work, the knowledge is continuously updated and bidirectionally distilled between modalities. To this end, we propose a new Cross-modal Mutual Distillation (CMD) framework with the following designs. On the one hand, the neighboring similarity distribution is introduced to model the knowledge learned in each modality, where the relational information is naturally suitable for the contrastive frameworks. On the other hand, asymmetrical configurations are used for teacher and student to stabilize the distillation process and to transfer high-confidence information between modalities. By derivation, we find that the cross-modal positive mining in previous works can be regarded as a degenerated version of our CMD. We perform extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and PKU-MMD II datasets. Our approach outperforms existing self-supervised methods and sets a series of new records.

    "abstract": "Network alignment task, which aims to identify corresponding nodes in different networks, is of great significance for many subsequent applications. Without the need for labeled anchor links, unsupervised alignment methods have been attracting more and more attention. However, the topological consistency assumptions defined by existing methods are generally low-order and less accurate because only the edge-indiscriminative topological pattern is considered, which is especially risky in an unsupervised setting. To reposition the focus of the alignment process from low-order to higher-order topological consistency, in this paper, we propose a fully unsupervised network alignment framework named HTC. The proposed higher-order topological consistency is formulated based on edge orbits, which is merged into the information aggregation process of a graph convolutional network so that the alignment consistencies are transformed into the similarity of node embeddings. Furthermore, the encoder is trained to be multi-orbit-aware and then be refined to identify more trusted anchor links. Node correspondence is comprehensively evaluated by integrating all different orders of consistency. {In addition to sound theoretical analysis, the superiority of the proposed method is also empirically demonstrated through extensive experimental evaluation. On three pairs of real-world datasets and two pairs of synthetic datasets, our HTC consistently outperforms a wide variety of unsupervised and supervised methods with the least or comparable time consumption. It also exhibits robustness to structural noise as a result of our multi-orbit-aware training mechanism. ",

Here, the multiple vehicle-to-vehicle(V2V) links reuse the spectrum of other vehicle-to-interface(V2I) and also those of other networks. The fast-changing environment in vehicular networks limits the idea of centralizing the CSI and allocate the channels. So, the idea of implementing ML-based methods is used here so that it can be implemented in a distributed manner in all vehicles. Here each On-Board Unit(OBU) can sense the signals in the channel and based on that information runs the RL to decide which channel to autonomously take up. Here, each V2V link will be an agent in MARL. The idea is to train the RL model in such a way that these agents will collaborate rather than compete. ",

    "abstract": "Deep convolutional neural network (CNN) training via iterative optimization has had incredible success in finding optimal parameters. However, modern CNN architectures often contain millions of parameters. Thus, any given model for a single architecture resides in a massive parameter space. Models with similar loss could have drastically different characteristics such as adversarial robustness, generalizability, and quantization robustness. For deep learning on the edge, quantization robustness is often crucial. Finding a model that is quantization-robust can sometimes require significant efforts. Recent works using Graph Hypernetworks (GHN) have shown remarkable performance predicting high-performant parameters of varying CNN architectures. Inspired by these successes, we wonder if the graph representations of GHN-2 can be leveraged to predict quantization-robust parameters as well, which we call GHN-Q. We conduct the first-ever study exploring the use of graph hypernetworks for predicting parameters of unseen quantized CNN architectures. We focus on a reduced CNN search space and find that GHN-Q can in fact predict quantization-robust parameters for various 8-bit quantized CNNs. Decent quantized accuracies are observed even with 4-bit quantization despite GHN-Q not being trained on it. Quantized finetuning of GHN-Q at lower bitwidths may bring further improvements and is currently being explored. ",

    "abstract": "The standard diagnostic procedures for targeted therapies in lung cancer treatment involve histological subtyping and subsequent detection of key driver mutations, such as EGFR. Even though molecular profiling can uncover the driver mutation, the process is often expensive and time-consuming. Deep learning-oriented image analysis offers a more economical alternative for discovering driver mutations directly from whole slide images (WSIs). In this work, we used customized deep learning pipelines with weak supervision to identify the morphological correlates of EGFR mutation from hematoxylin and eosin-stained WSIs, in addition to detecting tumor and histologically subtyping it. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline by conducting rigorous experiments and ablation studies on two lung cancer datasets - TCGA and a private dataset from India. With our pipeline, we achieved an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.964 for tumor detection, and 0.942 for histological subtyping between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma on the TCGA dataset. For EGFR detection, we achieved an average AUC of 0.864 on the TCGA dataset and 0.783 on the dataset from India. Our key learning points include the following. Firstly, there is no particular advantage of using a feature extractor layers trained on histology, if one is going to fine-tune the feature extractor on the target dataset. Secondly, selecting patches with high cellularity, presumably capturing tumor regions, is not always helpful, as the sign of a disease class may be present in the tumor-adjacent stroma. ",

To better study this problem, we build a novel Bregman divergence perspective for AT, in which AT can be viewed as the sliding process of the training data points on the negative entropy curve. Based on this perspective, we analyze the learning objectives of two typical AT methods, i.e., PGD-AT and TRADES, and we find that the optimization process of TRADES is easier than PGD-AT for that TRADES separates PGD-AT. In addition, we discuss the function of entropy in TRADES, and we find that models with high entropy can be better robustness learners. Inspired by the above findings, we propose two methods, i.e., FAIT and MER, which can both not only reduce the difficulty of optimization under the 10-step PGD adversaries, but also provide better robustness. Our work suggests that reducing the difficulty of optimization under the 10-step PGD adversaries is a promising approach for enhancing the adversarial robustness in AT. ",

To this end, in this paper, we proposed a hybrid contrastive fusion algorithm to extract robust view-common representation from unlabeled data. Specifically, we found that introducing an additional representation space and aligning representations on this space enables the model to learn robust view-common representations. At the same time, we designed an asymmetric contrastive strategy to ensure that the model does not obtain trivial solutions. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms 12 competitive multi-view methods on four real-world datasets in terms of clustering and classification.

The most notable achievements are made in the face generation domain.

To this end, we introduce a conditional GNeRF model that uses specific attribute labels as input in order to improve the controllabilities and disentangling abilities of 3D-aware generative models. We utilize the pre-trained 3D-aware model as the basis and integrate a dual-branches attribute-editing module (DAEM), that utilize attribute labels to provide control over generation. Moreover, we propose a TRIOT (TRaining as Init, and Optimizing for Tuning) method to optimize the latent vector to improve the precision of the attribute-editing further. Extensive experiments on the widely used FFHQ show that our model yields high-quality editing with better view consistency while preserving the non-target regions.

    "abstract": "The source code of a program not only defines its semantics but also contains subtle clues that can identify its author. Several studies have shown that these clues can be automatically extracted using machine learning and allow for determining a program's author among hundreds of programmers. This attribution poses a significant threat to developers of anti-censorship and privacy-enhancing technologies, as they become identifiable and may be prosecuted. An ideal protection from this threat would be the anonymization of source code. However, neither theoretical nor practical principles of such an anonymization have been explored so far. In this paper, we tackle this problem and develop a framework for reasoning about code anonymization. We prove that the task of generating a $k$-anonymous program -- a program that cannot be attributed to one of $k$ authors -- is not computable and thus a dead end for research. As a remedy, we introduce a relaxed concept called $k$-uncertainty, which enables us to measure the protection of developers. Based on this concept, we empirically study candidate techniques for anonymization, such as code normalization, coding style imitation, and code obfuscation. We find that none of the techniques provides sufficient protection when the attacker is aware of the anonymization. While we introduce an approach for removing remaining clues from the code, the main result of our work is negative: Anonymization of source code is a hard and open problem. ",

Nevertheless, many interesting problems involving linear PDEs may benefit from PINNs; these include parametric studies, multi-query problems, and parabolic (transient) PDEs. The purpose of this paper is to explore PINNs for linear PDEs whose solutions may present one or more boundary layers. More specifically, we analyze the steady-state reaction-advection-diffusion equation in regimes in which the diffusive coefficient is small in comparison with the reactive or advective coefficients. We show that adding information about these coefficients as predictor variables in a PINN results in better prediction models than in a PINN that only uses spatial information as predictor variables. This finding may be instrumental in multiscale problems where the coefficients of the PDEs present high variability in small spatiotemporal regions of the domain, and therefore PINNs may be employed together with domain decomposition techniques to efficiently approximate the PDEs locally at each partition of the spatiotemporal domain, without resorting to different learned PINN models at each of these partitions.

We make three contributions. First, we expose the complexity of causal inference in the context of adaptive bit rate video streaming, a challenging domain where the network conditions during the session act as a sequence of latent and confounding variables, and a change at any point in the session has a cascading impact on the rest of the session. Second, we present Veritas, a novel framework that tackles causal reasoning for video streaming without resorting to randomised trials. Integral to Veritas is an easy to interpret domain-specific ML model (an embedded Hidden Markov Model) that relates the latent stochastic process (intrinsic bandwidth that the video session can achieve) to actual observations (download times) while exploiting control variables such as the TCP state (e.g., congestion window) observed at the start of the download of video chunks. We show through experiments on an emulation testbed that Veritas can answer both counterfactual queries (e.g., the performance of a completed video session had it used a different buffer size) and interventional queries (e.g., estimating the download time for every possible video quality choice for the next chunk in a session in progress). In doing so, Veritas achieves accuracy close to an ideal oracle, while significantly outperforming both a commonly used baseline approach, and Fugu (an off-the-shelf neural network) neither of which account for causal effects.

In this competition, we focus on two fundamental challenges of causal machine learning in the context of education using time-series data. The first is to identify the causal relationships between different constructs, where a construct is defined as the smallest element of learning. The second challenge is to predict the impact of learning one construct on the ability to answer questions on other constructs. Addressing these challenges will not only impact the causal ML community but also enable optimisation of students' knowledge acquisition, which can be deployed in a real edtech solution impacting millions of students. Participants will run these tasks in an idealised environment with synthetic data and a real-world scenario with evaluation data collected from a series of A/B tests. We expect participants to develop novel machine learning methodologies for causal discovery between different constructs and the impact estimation of learning one construct on other constructs, which should bring fundamental advances to causal ML.

    "abstract": "With the world population projected to near 10 billion by 2050, minimizing crop damage and guaranteeing food security has never been more important. Machine learning has been proposed as a solution to quickly and efficiently identify diseases in crops. Convolutional Neural Networks typically require large datasets of annotated data which are not available on demand. Collecting this data is a long and arduous process which involves manually picking, imaging, and annotating each individual leaf. I tackle the problem of plant image data scarcity by exploring the efficacy of various data augmentation techniques when used in conjunction with transfer learning. I evaluate the impact of various data augmentation techniques both individually and combined on the performance of a ResNet. I propose an augmentation scheme utilizing a sequence of different augmentations which consistently improves accuracy through many trials. Using only 10 total seed images, I demonstrate that my augmentation framework can increase model accuracy by upwards of 25\\%. ",

    "abstract": "Accurately and quickly binuclear cell (BC) detection plays a significant role in predicting the risk of leukemia and other malignant tumors. However, manual microscopy counting is time-consuming and lacks objectivity. Moreover, with the limitation of staining quality and diversity of morphology features in BC microscopy whole slide images (WSIs), traditional image processing approaches are helpless. To overcome this challenge, we propose a two-stage detection method inspired by the structure prior of BC based on deep learning, which cascades to implement BCs coarse detection at the WSI-level and fine-grained classification in patch-level. The coarse detection network is a multi-task detection framework based on circular bounding boxes for cells detection, and central key points for nucleus detection. The circle representation reduces the degrees of freedom, mitigates the effect of surrounding impurities compared to usual rectangular boxes and can be rotation invariant in WSI. Detecting key points in the nucleus can assist network perception and be used for unsupervised color layer segmentation in later fine-grained classification. The fine classification network consists of a background region suppression module based on color layer mask supervision and a key region selection module based on a transformer due to its global modeling capability. Additionally, an unsupervised and unpaired cytoplasm generator network is firstly proposed to expand the long-tailed distribution dataset. Finally, experiments are performed on BC multicenter datasets. The proposed BC fine detection method outperforms other benchmarks in almost all the evaluation criteria, providing clarification and support for tasks such as cancer screenings. ",

    "abstract": "Nano-size drones hold enormous potential to explore unknown and complex environments. Their small size makes them agile and safe for operation close to humans and allows them to navigate through narrow spaces. However, their tiny size and payload restrict the possibilities for on-board computation and sensing, making fully autonomous flight extremely challenging. The first step towards full autonomy is reliable obstacle avoidance, which has proven to be technically challenging by itself in a generic indoor environment. Current approaches utilize vision-based or 1-dimensional sensors to support nano-drone perception algorithms. This work presents a lightweight obstacle avoidance system based on a novel millimeter form factor 64 pixels multi-zone Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor and a generalized model-free control policy. Reported in-field tests are based on the Crazyflie 2.1, extended by a custom multi-zone ToF deck, featuring a total flight mass of 35g. The algorithm only uses 0.3% of the on-board processing power (210uS execution time) with a frame rate of 15fps, providing an excellent foundation for many future applications. Less than 10% of the total drone power is needed to operate the proposed perception system, including both lifting and operating the sensor. The presented autonomous nano-size drone reaches 100% reliability at 0.5m/s in a generic and previously unexplored indoor environment. The proposed system is released open-source with an extensive dataset including ToF and gray-scale camera data, coupled with UAV position ground truth from motion capture. ",

    "abstract": "Predictive performance of machine learning models trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) can degrade considerably under distribution shifts. The presence of spurious correlations in training datasets leads ERM-trained models to display high loss when evaluated on minority groups not presenting such correlations. Extensive attempts have been made to develop methods improving worst-group robustness. However, they require group information for each training input or at least, a validation set with group labels to tune their hyperparameters, which may be expensive to get or unknown a priori. In this paper, we address the challenge of improving group robustness without group annotation during training or validation. To this end, we propose to partition the training dataset into groups based on Gram matrices of features extracted by an ``identification'' model and to apply robust optimization based on these pseudo-groups. In the realistic context where no group labels are available, our experiments show that our approach not only improves group robustness over ERM but also outperforms all recent baselines ",

Hence, ensuring objectivity and fairness while judging is important. To address this issue, some studies have attempted to use sensors and machine learning to automatically detect faults. However, there are problems associated with sensor attachments and equipment such as a high-speed camera, which conflict with the visual judgement of referees, and the interpretability of the fault detection models. In this study, we proposed a fault detection system for non-contact measurement. We used pose estimation and machine learning models trained based on the judgements of multiple qualified referees to realize fair fault judgement. We verified them using smartphone videos of normal race walking and walking with intentional faults in several athletes including the medalist of the Tokyo Olympics. The validation results show that the proposed system detected faults with an average accuracy of over 90%. We also revealed that the machine learning model detects faults according to the rules of race walking. In addition, the intentional faulty walking movement of the medalist was different from that of university walkers. This finding informs realization of a more general fault detection model.

The majority of existing seeding algorithms focus solely on maximizing the total number of reached nodes, overlooking the issue of group fairness, in particular, gender imbalance. To tackle the challenge of maximizing information spread on certain target groups, e.g., females, we introduce the concept of the community and gender-aware potential of users. We first show that the network's community structure is closely related to the gender distribution. Then, we propose an algorithm that leverages the information about community structure and its gender potential to iteratively modify a seed set such that the information spread on the target group meets the target ratio. Finally, we validate the algorithm by performing experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show that the proposed seeding algorithm achieves not only the target ratio but also the highest information spread, compared to the state-of-the-art gender-aware seeding algorithm. ",

Consequently, graduating students may feel inadequately prepared for research-focused careers, contributing to an attrition of talent.

These preconceptions can become obstacles for students in their own professional growth. Unfortunately, existing curricular and extracurricular programming in many doctoral programs do not include mechanisms to systematically address students' misconceptions of their profession. In this work, we describe a new initiative at our institution that aims to address Ph.D. mental health via a mandatory seminar for entering doctoral students. The seminar is designed to build professional resilience in students by (1) increasing self-regulatory competence, and (2) teaching students to proactively examine academic cultural values, and to participate in shaping them.

However, most public drone-based vision datasets focus on detection and tracking. On the other hand, the performance of most existing image super-resolution methods is sensitive to the dataset, specifically, the degradation model between high-resolution and low-resolution images. In this thesis, we propose the first image super-resolution dataset for drone vision. Image pairs are captured by two cameras on the drone with different focal lengths. We collect data at different altitudes and then propose pre-processing steps to align image pairs. Extensive empirical studies show domain gaps exist among images captured at different altitudes. Meanwhile, the performance of pretrained image super-resolution networks also suffers a drop on our dataset and varies among altitudes. Finally, we propose two methods to build a robust image super-resolution network at different altitudes. The first feeds altitude information into the network through altitude-aware layers. The second uses one-shot learning to quickly adapt the super-resolution model to unknown altitudes. Our results reveal that the proposed methods can efficiently improve the performance of super-resolution networks at varying altitudes. ",

    "abstract": "End-to-end (E2E) models have become the default choice for state-of-the-art speech recognition systems. Such models are trained on large amounts of labelled data, which are often not available for low-resource languages. Techniques such as self-supervised learning and transfer learning hold promise, but have not yet been effective in training accurate models. On the other hand, collecting labelled datasets on a diverse set of domains and speakers is very expensive. In this work, we demonstrate an inexpensive and effective alternative to these approaches by ``mining'' text and audio pairs for Indian languages from public sources, specifically from the public archives of All India Radio. As a key component, we adapt the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to align sentences with corresponding audio segments given a long audio and a PDF of its transcript, while being robust to errors due to OCR, extraneous text, and non-transcribed speech. We thus create Shrutilipi, a dataset which contains over 6,400 hours of labelled audio across 12 Indian languages totalling to 4.95M sentences. On average, Shrutilipi results in a 2.3x increase over publicly available labelled data. We establish the quality of Shrutilipi with 21 human evaluators across the 12 languages. We also establish the diversity of Shrutilipi in terms of represented regions, speakers, and mentioned named entities. Significantly, we show that adding Shrutilipi to the training set of Wav2Vec models leads to an average decrease in WER of 5.8\\% for 7 languages on the IndicSUPERB benchmark. For Hindi, which has the most benchmarks (7), the average WER falls from 18.8% to 13.5%. This improvement extends to efficient models: We show a 2.3% drop in WER for a Conformer model (10x smaller than Wav2Vec). Finally, we demonstrate the diversity of Shrutilipi by showing that the model trained with it is more robust to noisy input. ",

The parties are heterogeneous in nature: the parties' operating speeds, local model architectures, and optimizers may be different from one another and, further, they may change over time. To train a global model in such a system, Flex-VFL utilizes a form of parallel block coordinate descent, where parties train a partition of the global model via stochastic coordinate descent. We provide theoretical convergence analysis for Flex-VFL and show that the convergence rate is constrained by the party speeds and local optimizer parameters. We apply this analysis and extend our algorithm to adapt party learning rates in response to changing speeds and local optimizer parameters.

To tackle this, we introduce knowledge distillation to the few-shot object detection learning paradigm. We further run a motivating experiment, which demonstrates that in the process of knowledge distillation the empirical error of the teacher model degenerates the prediction performance of the few-shot object detection model, as the student. To understand the reasons behind this phenomenon, we revisit the learning paradigm of knowledge distillation on the few-shot object detection task from the causal theoretic standpoint, and accordingly, develop a Structural Causal Model. Following the theoretical guidance, we propose a backdoor adjustment-based knowledge distillation method for the few-shot object detection task, namely Disentangle and Remerge (D&R), to perform conditional causal intervention toward the corresponding Structural Causal Model. Theoretically, we provide an extended definition, i.e., general backdoor path, for the backdoor criterion, which can expand the theoretical application boundary of the backdoor criterion in specific cases. Empirically, the experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that D&R can yield significant performance boosts in few-shot object detection. ",

However, most GCN-based methods rigorously stick to a common GCN learning paradigm and suffer from two limitations: (1) the limited scalability due to the high computational cost and slow training convergence; (2) the notorious over-smoothing issue which reduces performance as stacking graph convolution layers. We argue that the above limitations are due to the lack of a deep understanding of GCN-based methods. To this end, we first investigate what design makes GCN effective for recommendation. By simplifying LightGCN, we show the close connection between GCN-based and low-rank methods such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Matrix Factorization (MF), where stacking graph convolution layers is to learn a low-rank representation by emphasizing (suppressing) components with larger (smaller) singular values. Based on this observation, we replace the core design of GCN-based methods with a flexible truncated SVD and propose a simplified GCN learning paradigm dubbed SVD-GCN, which only exploits $K$-largest singular vectors for recommendation. To alleviate the over-smoothing issue, we propose a renormalization trick to adjust the singular value gap, resulting in significant improvement. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our proposed SVD-GCN not only significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts but also achieves over 100x and 10x speedups over LightGCN and MF, respectively.

Previous methods based on neural volume rendering mostly train a fully implicit model, and they require hours of training for a single scene. Recent efforts explore the explicit volumetric representation, which substantially accelerates the optimization process by memorizing significant information in learnable voxel grids. However, these voxel-based methods often struggle in reconstructing fine-grained geometry. Through empirical studies, we found that high-quality surface reconstruction hinges on two key factors: the capability of constructing a coherent shape and the precise modeling of color-geometry dependency. In particular, the latter is the key to the accurate reconstruction of fine details. Inspired by these findings, we develop Voxurf, a voxel-based approach for efficient and accurate neural surface reconstruction, which consists of two stages: 1) leverage a learnable feature grid to construct the color field and obtain a coherent coarse shape, and 2) refine detailed geometry with a dual color network that captures precise color-geometry dependency. We further introduce a hierarchical geometry feature to enable information sharing across voxels. Our experiments show that Voxurf achieves high efficiency and high quality at the same time. On the DTU benchmark, Voxurf achieves higher reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, with 20x speedup in training. ",

Utility is typically measured as the error on representative proxy tasks, such as descriptive statistics, multivariate correlations, or classification accuracy. In this paper, we propose an alternative evaluation methodology for measuring the utility of differentially private synthetic data in scientific research, a measure we term \"epistemic parity.\" Our methodology consists of reproducing empirical conclusions of peer-reviewed papers that use publicly available datasets, and comparing these conclusions to those based on differentially private versions of the datasets. We instantiate our methodology over a benchmark of recent peer-reviewed papers that analyze public datasets in the ICPSR social science repository. We reproduce visualizations (qualitative results) and statistical measures (quantitative results) from each paper. We then generate differentially private synthetic datasets using state-of-the-art mechanisms and assess whether the conclusions stated in the paper hold. We find that, across reasonable epsilon values, epistemic parity only partially holds for each synthesizer we evaluated. Therefore, we advocate for both improving existing synthesizers and creating new data release mechanisms that offer strong guarantees for epistemic parity while achieving risk-aware, best effort protection from privacy attacks.

In the feature extraction part, based on the analysis of time-series representation of recording source signals, we extract sequential Gaussian mean matrix with long-term and short-term representation ability by using the sensitivity of Gaussian mixture model to data distribution. In the model construction part, we design a structured spatio-temporal representation learning network C3D-BiLSTM to fully characterize the spatio-temporal information, combine 3D convolutional network and bidirectional long short-term memory network for short-term spectral information and long-time fluctuation information representation learning, and achieve accurate recognition of cell-phones by fusing spatio-temporal feature information of recording source signals. The method achieves an average accuracy of 99.03% for the closed-set recognition of 45 cell-phones under the CCNU\\_Mobile dataset, and 98.18% in small sample size experiments, with recognition performance better than the existing state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the method exhibits excellent recognition performance in multi-class cell-phones recognition. ",

    "abstract": "The number of internet-connected devices has been exponentially growing with the massive volume of heterogeneous data generated from various devices, resulting in a highly intertwined cyber-physical system. Currently, the Edge Intelligence System (EIS) concept that leverages the merits of edge computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is utilized to provide smart cloud services with powerful computational processing and reduce decision-making delays. Thus, EIS offers a possible solution to realizing future Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), especially in a vehicular network framework. However, since the central aggregator server supervises the entire system orchestration, the existing EIS framework faces several challenges and is still potentially susceptible to numerous malicious attacks. Hence, to solve the issues mentioned earlier, this paper presents the notion of secure edge intelligence, merging the benefits of Federated Learning (FL), blockchain, and Local Differential Privacy (LDP). The blockchain-assisted FL approach efficiently improves traffic prediction accuracy and enhances user privacy and security by recording transactions in immutable distributed ledger networks and providing a decentralized reward mechanism system. Furthermore, LDP is empowered to strengthen the confidentiality of data sharing transactions, especially in protecting users' private data from various attacks. The proposed framework has been implemented in two scenarios, i.e., blockchain-based FL to efficiently develop the decentralized traffic management for vehicular networks and LDP-based FL to produce randomized privacy protection using the IBM Library for differential privacy.

    "abstract": "Addressing the need for explainable Machine Learning has emerged as one of the most important research directions in modern Artificial Intelligence (AI). While the current dominant paradigm in the field is based on black-box models, typically in the form of (deep) neural networks, these models lack direct interpretability for human users, i.e., their outcomes (and, even more so, their inner working) are opaque and hard to understand. This is hindering the adoption of AI in safety-critical applications, where high interests are at stake. In these applications, explainable by design models, such as decision trees, may be more suitable, as they provide interpretability. Recent works have proposed the hybridization of decision trees and Reinforcement Learning, to combine the advantages of the two approaches. So far, however, these works have focused on the optimization of those hybrid models. Here, we apply MAP-Elites for diversifying hybrid models over a feature space that captures both the model complexity and its behavioral variability. We apply our method on two well-known control problems from the OpenAI Gym library, on which we discuss the \"illumination\" patterns projected by MAP-Elites, comparing its results against existing similar approaches.

    "abstract": "Smart energy networks provide for an effective means to accommodate high penetrations of variable renewable energy sources like solar and wind, which are key for deep decarbonisation of energy production. However, given the variability of the renewables as well as the energy demand, it is imperative to develop effective control and energy storage schemes to manage the variable energy generation and achieve desired system economics and environmental goals. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid energy storage system composed of battery and hydrogen energy storage to handle the uncertainties related to electricity prices, renewable energy production and consumption. We aim to improve renewable energy utilisation and minimise energy costs and carbon emissions while ensuring energy reliability and stability within the network. To achieve this, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient approach, which is a deep reinforcement learning-based control strategy to optimise the scheduling of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand in real-time. The proposed approach is model-free and does not require explicit knowledge and rigorous mathematical models of the smart energy network environment. Simulation results based on real-world data show that: (i) integration and optimised operation of the hybrid energy storage system and energy demand reduces carbon emissions by 78.69%, improves cost savings by 23.5% and renewable energy utilisation by over 13.2% compared to other baseline models and (ii) the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art self-learning algorithms like deep-Q network.

To study this phenomenon, we introduce a model of interaction between agents in the network designed for reducing the inequality in the distribution of capital. To achieve the effect of inequality reduction, we interpret the outcome of the elementary game played in the network such that the wining of the game is translated into the reduction of the inequality. We study different interpretations of the introduced scheme and their impact on the behaviour of agents in the terms of the capital distribution, and we provide examples based on the capital dependent Parrondo's paradox. The results presented in this study provide insight into the mechanics of the inequality formation in the society. ",

MuLan takes the form of a two-tower, joint audio-text embedding model trained using 44 million music recordings (370K hours) and weakly-associated, free-form text annotations. Through its compatibility with a wide range of music genres and text styles (including conventional music tags), the resulting audio-text representation subsumes existing ontologies while graduating to true zero-shot functionalities. We demonstrate the versatility of the MuLan embeddings with a range of experiments including transfer learning, zero-shot music tagging, language understanding in the music domain, and cross-modal retrieval applications.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of designing an optimal sequence of interventions in a causal graphical model to minimize the cumulative regret with respect to the best intervention in hindsight. This is, naturally, posed as a causal bandit problem. The focus is on causal bandits for linear structural equation models (SEMs) and soft interventions. It is assumed that the graph's structure is known, and it has $N$ nodes. Two linear mechanisms, one soft intervention and one observational, are assumed for each node, giving rise to $2^N$ possible interventions. The existing causal bandit algorithms assume that at least the interventional distributions of the reward node's parents are fully specified. However, there are $2^N$ such distributions (one corresponding to each intervention), acquiring which becomes prohibitive even in moderate-sized graphs. This paper dispenses with the assumption of knowing these distributions. Two algorithms are proposed for the frequentist (UCB-based) and Bayesian (Thompson Sampling-based) settings. The key idea of these algorithms is to avoid directly estimating the $2^N$ reward distributions and instead estimate the parameters that fully specify the SEMs (linear in $N$) and use them to compute the rewards. In both algorithms, under boundedness assumptions on noise and the parameter space, the cumulative regrets scale as $\\tilde{\\cal O} ((2d)^L L \\sqrt{T})$, where $d$ is the graph's maximum degree, and $L$ is the length of its longest causal path.

    "abstract": "Traditional models of opinion dynamics, in which nodes in a network change their opinions based on their interactions with neighboring nodes, consider how opinions evolve either on time-independent networks or on temporal networks with edges that follow Poisson statistics. Most such models are Markovian. In many real-life networks, interactions between individuals (and hence the edges in a network) follow non-Poisson processes, which leads to dynamics on networks with memory-dependent effects. In this paper, we model opinion dynamics in which the entities of a network interact and change their opinions via a random-walk process. When the walkers have non-Poisson interevent statistics, the corresponding opinion models yield non-Markovian dynamics. We derive an opinion model that is governed by an arbitrary waiting-time distribution (WTD) and illustrate a variety of induced opinion models from common WTDs (including Dirac delta, exponential, and heavy-tailed distributions). We analyze the convergence to consensus of these models and prove that homogeneous history-dependent models of opinion dynamics in our framework always converge to the same steady state regardless of the WTD. We also conduct a numerical investigation of the effects of waiting-time distributions on both transient dynamics and steady states. We observe that models that are induced by heavy-tailed WTDs converge to a steady state more slowly than those with light tails (or with compact support) and that entities with larger waiting times exert a larger influence on the mean opinion at steady states.
