    "abstract": "In this study, we investigate how the central nervous system (CNS) organizes postural control synergies when individuals perform a complex catch-and-throw task in a virtual reality (VR) environment. A Robotic Upright Stand Trainer (RobUST) platform, including surface electromyography and kinematics, was used to investigate how the CNS fine-tunes postural synergies with perturbative and assist-as-needed force fields. A control group without assistive forces was recruited to elucidate the effect of force fields on motor performance and postural synergy organization after the perturbation and during the VR reaching task. We found that the application of assistive forces significantly improved reaching and balance control. The group receiving assistive forces displayed four postural control synergies characterized by higher complexity (i.e., greater number of muscles involved). However, control subjects displayed eight synergies that recruited less number of muscles. In conclusion, assistive forces reduce the number of postural synergies while increasing the complexity of muscle module composition. ",

    "title": "Verifiable Differential Privacy For When The Curious Become Dishonest",
    "abstract": "Many applications seek to produce differentially private statistics on sensitive data. Traditional approaches in the centralised model rely on a trusted aggregator to gather the raw data, aggregate statistics and introduce appropriate noise. Recent work has tried to relax the trust assumptions and reduce the need for trusted entities. However, such systems can trade off trust for increased noise and still require complete trust in some participants. Moreover, they do not prevent a malicious entity from introducing adversarial noise to skew the result or unmask some inputs. In this paper, we introduce the notion of ``verifiable differential privacy with covert security''. The purpose is to ensure both privacy of the client's data and assurance that the output is not subject to any form of adversarial manipulation. The result is that everyone is assured that the noise used for differential privacy has been generated correctly, but no one can determine what the noise was. In the event of a malicious entity attempting to pervert the protocol, their actions will be detected with a constant probability negligibly close to one. We show that such verifiable privacy is practical and can be implemented at scale. ",

    "abstract": "Current Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from the over-smoothing problem, which results in indistinguishable node representations and low model performance with more GNN layers. Many methods have been put forward to tackle this problem in recent years. However, existing tackling over-smoothing methods emphasize model performance and neglect the over-smoothness of node representations. Additional, different approaches are applied one at a time, while there lacks an overall framework to jointly leverage multiple solutions to the over-smoothing challenge. To solve these problems, we propose GraTO, a framework based on neural architecture search to automatically search for GNNs architecture. GraTO adopts a novel loss function to facilitate striking a balance between model performance and representation smoothness. In addition to existing methods, our search space also includes DropAttribute, a novel scheme for alleviating the over-smoothing challenge, to fully leverage diverse solutions. We conduct extensive experiments on six real-world datasets to evaluate GraTo, which demonstrates that GraTo outperforms baselines in the over-smoothing metrics and achieves competitive performance in accuracy. GraTO is especially effective and robust with increasing numbers of GNN layers. Further experiments bear out the quality of node representations learned with GraTO and the effectiveness of model architecture. We make cide of GraTo available at Github (\\url{https://github.com/fxsxjtu/GraTO}). ",

    "abstract": "This paper studies how to train machine-learning models that directly approximate the optimal solutions of constrained optimization problems. This is an empirical risk minimization under constraints, which is challenging as training must balance optimality and feasibility conditions. Supervised learning methods often approach this challenge by training the model on a large collection of pre-solved instances. This paper takes a different route and proposes the idea of Primal-Dual Learning (PDL), a self-supervised training method that does not require a set of pre-solved instances or an optimization solver for training and inference. Instead, PDL mimics the trajectory of an Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) and jointly trains primal and dual neural networks. Being a primal-dual method, PDL uses instance-specific penalties of the constraint terms in the loss function used to train the primal network. Experiments show that, on a set of nonlinear optimization benchmarks, PDL typically exhibits negligible constraint violations and minor optimality gaps, and is remarkably close to the ALM optimization. PDL also demonstrated improved or similar performance in terms of the optimality gaps, constraint violations, and training times compared to existing approaches. ",

Among the top 20 California wildfires, those in 2020-2021 burned more acres than the last century combined. California's 2018 wildfire season caused damages of $148.5 billion. Among millions of impacted people, those living with disabilities (around 15% of the world population) are disproportionately impacted due to inadequate means of alerts. In this project, a multi-modal wildfire prediction and personalized early warning system has been developed based on an advanced machine learning architecture. Sensor data from the Environmental Protection Agency and historical wildfire data from 2012 to 2018 have been compiled to establish a comprehensive wildfire database, the largest of its kind. Next, a novel U-Convolutional-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network was designed with a special architecture for extracting key spatial and temporal features from contiguous environmental parameters indicative of impending wildfires. Environmental and meteorological factors were incorporated into the database and classified as leading indicators and trailing indicators, correlated to risks of wildfire conception and propagation respectively. Additionally, geological data was used to provide better wildfire risk assessment. This novel spatio-temporal neural network achieved >97% accuracy vs. around 76% using traditional convolutional neural networks, successfully predicting 2018's five most devastating wildfires 5-14 days in advance. Finally, a personalized early warning system, tailored to individuals with sensory disabilities or respiratory exacerbation conditions, was proposed. This technique would enable fire departments to anticipate and prevent wildfires before they strike and provide early warnings for at-risk individuals for better preparation, thereby saving lives and reducing economic damages.

While much research attention has been placed on defining new test-time measures of OOD uncertainty, these methods do not fundamentally change how deep generative models are regularized and optimized in training. In particular, generative models are shown to overly rely on the background information to estimate the likelihood. To address the issue, we propose a novel frequency-regularized learning FRL framework for OOD detection, which incorporates high-frequency information into training and guides the model to focus on semantically relevant features. FRL effectively improves performance on a wide range of generative architectures, including variational auto-encoder, GLOW, and PixelCNN++. On a new large-scale evaluation task, FRL achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming a strong baseline Likelihood Regret by 10.7% (AUROC) while achieving 147$\\times$ faster inference speed. Extensive ablations show that FRL improves the OOD detection performance while preserving the image generation quality. Code is available at https://github.com/mu-cai/FRL. ",

To address these problems and overcome dataset-dependent limitations that inhibit the successful training of deep learning models, we pursue representation learning to train generalized embeddings that can be used for a wide variety of sound effects libraries and are a taxonomy-agnostic representation of sound. We show that a task-specific but dataset-independent representation can successfully address data issues such as class imbalance, inconsistent class labels, and insufficient dataset size, outperforming established representations such as OpenL3.

In the first, by exploiting historical data and for each DER, we learn a function representing the desirable equilibrium points for the power network.

In this paper, we present a novel test time adaptation strategy named Graph Adversarial Pseudo Group Contrast (GAPGC), for graph neural networks TTA, to better adapt to the Out Of Distribution (OOD) test data. Specifically, GAPGC employs a contrastive learning variant as a self-supervised task during TTA, equipped with Adversarial Learnable Augmenter and Group Pseudo-Positive Samples to enhance the relevance between the self-supervised task and the main task, boosting the performance of the main task. Furthermore, we provide theoretical evidence that GAPGC can extract minimal sufficient information for the main task from information theory perspective.

    "abstract": "In an era of information explosion, recommendation systems play an important role in people's daily life by facilitating content exploration. It is known that user activeness, i.e., number of behaviors, tends to follow a long-tail distribution, where the majority of users are with low activeness. In practice, we observe that tail users suffer from significantly lower-quality recommendation than the head users after joint training. We further identify that a model trained on tail users separately still achieve inferior results due to limited data. Though long-tail distributions are ubiquitous in recommendation systems, improving the recommendation performance on the tail users still remains challenge in both research and industry. Directly applying related methods on long-tail distribution might be at risk of hurting the experience of head users, which is less affordable since a small portion of head users with high activeness contribute a considerate portion of platform revenue. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that significantly improves the recommendation performance of the tail users while achieving at least comparable performance for the head users over the base model. The essence of this approach is a novel Gradient Aggregation technique that learns common knowledge shared by all users into a backbone model, followed by separate plugin prediction networks for the head users and the tail users personalization. As for common knowledge learning, we leverage the backward adjustment from the causality theory for deconfounding the gradient estimation and thus shielding off the backbone training from the confounder, i.e., user activeness. We conduct extensive experiments on two public recommendation benchmark datasets and a large-scale industrial datasets collected from the Alipay platform. Empirical studies validate the rationality and effectiveness of our approach. ",

Most prior KGC work focuses on learning representations for entities and relations. Yet, a higher-dimensional embedding space is usually required for a better reasoning capability, which leads to a larger model size and hinders applicability to real-world problems (e.g., large-scale KGs or mobile/edge computing). A lightweight modularized KGC solution, called GreenKGC, is proposed in this work to address this issue. GreenKGC consists of three modules: 1) representation learning, 2) feature pruning, and 3) decision learning. In Module 1, we leverage existing KG embedding models to learn high-dimensional representations for entities and relations. In Module 2, the KG is partitioned into several relation groups followed by a feature pruning process to find the most discriminant features for each relation group. Finally, a classifier is assigned to each relation group to cope with low-dimensional triple features for KGC tasks in Module 3. We evaluate the performance of GreenKGC on four widely used link prediction datasets and observe that GreenKGC can achieve comparable or even better performance against original high-dimensional embeddings with a much smaller model size. Furthermore, we experiment on two triple classification datasets to demonstrate that the same methodology can generalize to more tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Side-channel attacks (SCAs), which infer secret information (for example secret keys) by exploiting information that leaks from the implementation (such as power consumption), have been shown to be a non-negligible threat to modern cryptographic implementations and devices in recent years. Hence, how to prevent side-channel attacks on cryptographic devices has become an important problem. One of the widely used countermeasures to against power SCAs is the injection of random noise sequences into the raw leakage traces. However, the indiscriminate injection of random noise can lead to significant increases in energy consumption in device, and ways must be found to reduce the amount of energy in noise generation while keeping the side-channel invisible. In this paper, we propose an optimal energy-efficient design for artificial noise generation to prevent side-channel attacks. This approach exploits the sparsity among the leakage traces. We model the side-channel as a communication channel, which allows us to use channel capacity to measure the mutual information between the secret and the leakage traces. For a given energy budget in the noise generation, we obtain the optimal design of the artificial noise injection by solving the side-channel's channel capacity minimization problem. The experimental results also validate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme. ",

To overcome the above limitation, we propose a part-aware prototypical representation for one-shot skeleton-based action recognition. Our method captures skeleton motion patterns at two distinctive spatial levels, one for global contexts among all body joints, referred to as body level, and the other attends to local spatial regions of body parts, referred to as the part level. We also devise a class-agnostic attention mechanism to highlight important parts for each action class. Specifically, we develop a part-aware prototypical graph network consisting of three modules: a cascaded embedding module for our dual-level modelling, an attention-based part fusion module to fuse parts and generate part-aware prototypes, and a matching module to perform classification with the part-aware representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two public skeleton-based action recognition datasets: NTU RGB+D 120 and NW-UCLA. ",

As the size of real-world graphs continues to scale, the GNN training system faces a scalability challenge. Distributed training is a popular approach to address this challenge by scaling out CPU nodes. However, not much attention has been paid to disk-based GNN training, which can scale up the single-node system in a more cost-effective manner by leveraging high-performance storage devices like NVMe SSDs. We observe that the data movement between the main memory and the disk is the primary bottleneck in the SSD-based training system, and that the conventional GNN training pipeline is sub-optimal without taking this overhead into account. Thus, we propose Ginex, the first SSD-based GNN training system that can process billion-scale graph datasets on a single machine. Inspired by the inspector-executor execution model in compiler optimization, Ginex restructures the GNN training pipeline by separating sample and gather stages. This separation enables Ginex to realize a provably optimal replacement algorithm, known as Belady's algorithm, for caching feature vectors in memory, which account for the dominant portion of I/O accesses. According to our evaluation with four billion-scale graph datasets, Ginex achieves 2.11x higher training throughput on average (up to 2.67x at maximum) than the SSD-extended PyTorch Geometric. ",

In many practical usages, there is no reliable information or labels over the vertices or edges, leaving structural similarity as the only information available to match such a graph. In such cases, one often assumes a small amount of already aligned vertices -- called a seed. Current state-of-the-art scalable seeded alignment algorithms are based on percolation. Namely, aligned vertices are used to align their neighbors and gradually percolate in parallel in both graphs. However, percolation-based graph alignment algorithms are still limited in scale-free degree distributions. We here propose `IRMA' -- Iterative Repair for graph MAtching to show that the accuracy of percolation-based algorithms can be improved in real-world graphs with a limited additional computational cost, and with lower run time when used in a parallel version. IRMA starts by creating a primary alignment using an existing percolation algorithm, then it iteratively repairs the mistakes in the previous alignment steps. We prove that IRMA improves on single-iteration algorithms. We then numerically show that it is significantly better than all state-of-the-art seeded graph alignment algorithms on the graphs that they tested. In scale-free networks, many vertices have a very low degree. Such vertices have a high probability of erroneous alignments. We show that combining iterations with high recall but low precision in the alignment leads in the long run to higher recall and precision for the entire alignment. ",

    "abstract": "Self-supervised monocular methods can efficiently learn depth information of weakly textured surfaces or reflective objects. However, the depth accuracy is limited due to the inherent ambiguity in monocular geometric modeling. In contrast, multi-frame depth estimation methods improve the depth accuracy thanks to the success of Multi-View Stereo (MVS), which directly makes use of geometric constraints. Unfortunately, MVS often suffers from texture-less regions, non-Lambertian surfaces, and moving objects, especially in real-world video sequences without known camera motion and depth supervision. Therefore, we propose MOVEDepth, which exploits the MOnocular cues and VElocity guidance to improve multi-frame Depth learning. Unlike existing methods that enforce consistency between MVS depth and monocular depth, MOVEDepth boosts multi-frame depth learning by directly addressing the inherent problems of MVS. The key of our approach is to utilize monocular depth as a geometric priority to construct MVS cost volume, and adjust depth candidates of cost volume under the guidance of predicted camera velocity. We further fuse monocular depth and MVS depth by learning uncertainty in the cost volume, which results in a robust depth estimation against ambiguity in multi-view geometry. Extensive experiments show MOVEDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance: Compared with Monodepth2 and PackNet, our method relatively improves the depth accuracy by 20\\% and 19.8\\% on the KITTI benchmark. MOVEDepth also generalizes to the more challenging DDAD benchmark, relatively outperforming ManyDepth by 7.2\\%. The code is available at https://github.com/JeffWang987/MOVEDepth. ",

    "title": "Measuring Friendship Closeness: A Perspective of Social Identity Theory",
    "abstract": "Measuring the closeness of friendships is an important problem that finds numerous applications in practice. For example, online gaming platforms often host friendship-enhancing events in which a user (called the source) only invites his/her friend (called the target) to play together. In this scenario, the measure of friendship closeness is the backbone for understanding source invitation and target adoption behaviors, and underpins the recommendation of promising targets for the sources. However, most existing measures for friendship closeness only consider the information between the source and target but ignore the information of groups where they are located, which renders inferior results. To address this issue, we present new measures for friendship closeness based on the social identity theory (SIT), which describes the inclination that a target endorses behaviors of users inside the same group. The core of SIT is the process that a target assesses groups of users as them or us. Unfortunately, this process is difficult to be captured due to perceptual factors. To this end, we seamlessly reify the factors of SIT into quantitative measures, which consider local and global information of a target's group. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal against 8 state-of-the-art methods on 3 online gaming datasets. In particular, we demonstrate that our solution can outperform the best competitor on the behavior prediction (resp. online target recommendation) by up to 23.2% (resp. 34.2%) in the corresponding evaluation metric.

Recently, Capsule Networks were introduced to enhance explainability of a model, where each capsule is an explicit representation of an object or its parts.

To embed samples into informative features, previous works often use convolutional neural networks optimized for classification, which is criticized by recent studies. Therefore, various feature spaces have been explored to discover alternatives. Among them, a surprising approach is to use a randomly initialized neural network for feature embedding. However, the fundamental basis to employ the random features has not been sufficiently justified. In this paper, we rigorously investigate the feature space of models with random weights in comparison to that of trained models. Furthermore, we provide an empirical evidence to choose networks for random features to obtain consistent and reliable results. Our results indicate that the features from random networks can evaluate generative models well similarly to those from trained networks, and furthermore, the two types of features can be used together in a complementary way.

Specifically, SoMoFormer extracts motion features from sub-sequences in displacement trajectory space to effectively learn both local and global pose dynamics for each individual.

In practice, however, this is not always the case. This poses a great problem for scene text detection for which a consistent spatial response is crucial, irrespective of the position of the text in the scene. Using a simple synthetic experiment, we demonstrate the inherent shift variance of a state-of-the-art fully convolutional text detector. Furthermore, using the same experimental setting, we show how small architectural changes can lead to an improved shift equivariance and less variation of the detector output. We validate the synthetic results using a real-world training schedule on the text detection network. To quantify the amount of shift variability, we propose a metric based on well-established text detection benchmarks. While the proposed architectural changes are not able to fully recover shift equivariance, adding smoothing filters can substantially improve shift consistency on common text datasets. Considering the potentially large impact of small shifts, we propose to extend the commonly used text detection metrics by the metric described in this work, in order to be able to quantify the consistency of text detectors.

Adversarial attacks threaten the robustness of neural network classifiers, causing them to consistently and confidently misidentify road signs. One such class of attack, shadow-based attacks, causes misidentifications by applying a natural-looking shadow to input images, resulting in road signs that appear natural to a human observer but confusing for these classifiers. Current defenses against such attacks use a simple adversarial training procedure to achieve a rather low 25\\% and 40\\% robustness on the GTSRB and LISA test sets, respectively. In this paper, we propose a robust, fast, and generalizable method, designed to defend against shadow attacks in the context of road sign recognition, that augments source images with binary adaptive threshold and edge maps. We empirically show its robustness against shadow attacks, and reformulate the problem to show its similarity $\\varepsilon$ perturbation-based attacks. Experimental results show that our edge defense results in 78\\% robustness while maintaining 98\\% benign test accuracy on the GTSRB test set, with similar results from our threshold defense.

In multivariate time series forecasting, each variable depends on its historical values and there are inter-dependencies among variables as well.

To move towards this goal, we propose the Time Series Attention Transformer (TSAT) for multivariate time series representation learning. Using TSAT, we represent both temporal information and inter-dependencies of multivariate time series in terms of edge-enhanced dynamic graphs. The intra-series correlations are represented by nodes in a dynamic graph; a self-attention mechanism is modified to capture the inter-series correlations by using the super-empirical mode decomposition (SMD) module. We applied the embedded dynamic graphs to times series forecasting problems, including two real-world datasets and two benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments show that TSAT clearly outerperforms six state-of-the-art baseline methods in various forecasting horizons.

We propose to bridge this gap in understanding by studying the neural tangent kernel of sheaf convolutional networks--a topological generalization of graph convolutional networks. To this end, we derive a parameterization of the neural tangent kernel for sheaf convolutional networks which separates the function into two parts: one driven by a forward diffusion process determined by the graph, and the other determined by the composite effect of nodes' activations on the output layer.

However, such a result does not hold in an auction on a network, where the information of the auction is spread via the agents, and they need incentives to forward the information. In recent times, a few auctions (e.g., [10, 15]) were designed that appropriately incentivize the intermediate nodes on the network to promulgate the information to potentially more valuable bidders. In this paper, we provide a Myerson-like characterization of incentive-compatible auctions on a network and show that the currently known auctions fall within this larger class of randomized auctions.

Then, we introduce an instrumental variable to eliminate the confounding causal effects, thus extracting the pure causal effect between sentence and sentiment.

Dispersed throughout an image, the new trigger produces weak perturbation to individual pixels, but collectively holds a strong recognizable pattern to train and activate the backdoor of the DNN. We also analytically reveal that the trigger is increasingly effective with the improving resolution of the images.

    "abstract": "As post hoc explanations are increasingly used to understand the behavior of graph neural networks (GNNs), it becomes crucial to evaluate the quality and reliability of GNN explanations. However, assessing the quality of GNN explanations is challenging as existing graph datasets have no or unreliable ground-truth explanations for a given task. Here, we introduce a synthetic graph data generator, ShapeGGen, which can generate a variety of benchmark datasets (e.g., varying graph sizes, degree distributions, homophilic vs. heterophilic graphs) accompanied by ground-truth explanations. Further, the flexibility to generate diverse synthetic datasets and corresponding ground-truth explanations allows us to mimic the data generated by various real-world applications. We include ShapeGGen and several real-world graph datasets into an open-source graph explainability library, GraphXAI. In addition to synthetic and real-world graph datasets with ground-truth explanations, GraphXAI provides data loaders, data processing functions, visualizers, GNN model implementations, and evaluation metrics to benchmark the performance of GNN explainability methods.

The use of ArUco markers and their 2D orientation with respect to the camera of the robot and the distance to the markers from the camera is used to calculate the relative position of the robot as well as the relative positions of other markers. The proposed method combines aspects of beacon-based navigation and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping based navigation. The implementation of this method uses a depth camera to obtain the distance to the marker. After calculating the required orientation of the marker, it relies on odometry calculations for tracking the position after localization with respect to the marker. Using the odometry and the relative position of one marker, the robot is then localized with respect to another marker. The relative positions and orientation of the two markers are then calculated. The markers are represented as nodes and the relative distances and orientations are represented as edges connecting the nodes and a node graph can be generated that represents a map for the robot. The method was tested on a wheeled humanoid robot with the objective of having it autonomously navigate to a charging station inside a room. This objective was successfully achieved and the limitations and future improvements are briefly discussed. ",

Due to the heterogeneity in user's attributes and local data, attaining personalized models is critical to help improve the federated recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural Network based Personalized Federated Recommendation (PerFedRec) framework via joint representation learning, user clustering, and model adaptation. Specifically, we construct a collaborative graph and incorporate attribute information to jointly learn the representation through a federated GNN. Based on these learned representations, we cluster users into different user groups and learn personalized models for each cluster. Then each user learns a personalized model by combining the global federated model, the cluster-level federated model, and the user's fine-tuned local model. To alleviate the heavy communication burden, we intelligently select a few representative users (instead of randomly picked users) from each cluster to participate in training. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our proposed method achieves superior performance over existing methods. ",

However, transforming image features into BEV necessitates special operators to conduct feature sampling.

To address this problem, we revisit the generation of BEV representation and propose detecting objects in perspective BEV -- a new BEV representation that does not require feature sampling. We demonstrate that perspective BEV features can likewise enjoy the benefits of the BEV paradigm. Moreover, the perspective BEV improves detection performance by addressing issues caused by feature sampling. We propose PersDet for high-performance object detection in perspective BEV space based on this discovery. While implementing a simple and memory-efficient structure, PersDet outperforms existing state-of-the-art monocular methods on the nuScenes benchmark, reaching 34.6% mAP and 40.8% NDS when using ResNet-50 as the backbone.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal aspect-based sentiment classification (MABSC) is an emerging classification task that aims to classify the sentiment of a given target such as a mentioned entity in data with different modalities. In typical multi-modal data with text and image, previous approaches do not make full use of the fine-grained semantics of the image, especially in conjunction with the semantics of the text and do not fully consider modeling the relationship between fine-grained image information and target, which leads to insufficient use of image and inadequate to identify fine-grained aspects and opinions. To tackle these limitations, we propose a new framework SeqCSG including a method to construct sequential cross-modal semantic graphs and an encoder-decoder model. Specifically, we extract fine-grained information from the original image, image caption, and scene graph, and regard them as elements of the cross-modal semantic graph as well as tokens from texts. The cross-modal semantic graph is represented as a sequence with a multi-modal visible matrix indicating relationships between elements. In order to effectively utilize the cross-modal semantic graph, we propose an encoder-decoder method with a target prompt template. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods and achieves the state-of-the-art on two standard datasets MABSC. Further analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of each component and our model can implicitly learn the correlation between the target and fine-grained information of the image. ",

Despite great efforts made by the Explainable AI (XAI) community, explanations lack robustness--indistinguishable input perturbations may lead to different XAI results. Thus, it is vital to assess how robust DL interpretability is, given an XAI technique. To this end, we identify the following challenges that state-of-the-art is unable to cope with collectively: i) XAI techniques are highly heterogeneous; ii) misinterpretations are normally rare events; iii) both worst-case and overall robustness are of practical interest. In this paper, we propose two evaluation methods to tackle them--i) they are of black-box nature, based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Subset Simulation (SS); ii) bespoke fitness functions are used by GA to solve a constrained optimisation efficiently, while SS is dedicated to estimating rare event probabilities; iii) two diverse metrics are introduced, concerning the worst-case interpretation discrepancy and a probabilistic notion of \\textit{how} robust in general, respectively. We conduct experiments to study the accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency of our methods that outperform state-of-the-arts. Finally, we show two applications of our methods for ranking robust XAI methods and selecting training schemes to improve both classification and interpretation robustness. ",

When the tasks are similar, sharing the decoder serves as an additional inductive bias providing more room for tasks to share complementary information among themselves. However, increased sharing exposes more parameters to task interference which likely hinders both generalization and robustness. Effective ways to curb this interference while exploiting the inductive bias of sharing the decoder remains an open challenge. To address this challenge, we propose Progressive Decoder Fusion (PDF) to progressively combine task decoders based on inter-task representation similarity. We show that this procedure leads to a multi-task network with better generalization to in-distribution and out-of-distribution data and improved robustness to adversarial attacks. Additionally, we observe that the predictions of different tasks of this multi-task network are more consistent with each other. ",

Existing leading methods tend to estimate the depth of the input image first, and detect the 3D object based on point cloud. This routine suffers from the inherent gap between depth estimation and object detection. Besides, the prediction error accumulation would also affect the performance. In this paper, a novel method named MonoPCNS is proposed. The insight behind introducing MonoPCNS is that we propose to simulate the feature learning behavior of a point cloud based detector for monocular detector during the training period. Hence, during inference period, the learned features and prediction would be similar to the point cloud based detector as possible. To achieve it, we propose one scene-level simulation module, one RoI-level simulation module and one response-level simulation module, which are progressively used for the detector's full feature learning and prediction pipeline. We apply our method to the famous M3D-RPN detector and CaDDN detector, conducting extensive experiments on KITTI and Waymo Open dataset. Results show that our method consistently improves the performance of different monocular detectors for a large margin without changing their network architectures.

    "abstract": "Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) systems perform a sequence-to-sequence task, where an input word sequence containing grammatical errors, is corrected for these errors by the GEC system to output a grammatically correct word sequence. With the advent of deep learning methods, automated GEC systems have become increasingly popular. For example, GEC systems are often used on speech transcriptions of English learners as a form of assessment and feedback - these powerful GEC systems can be used to automatically measure an aspect of a candidate's fluency. The count of \\textit{edits} from a candidate's input sentence (or essay) to a GEC system's grammatically corrected output sentence is indicative of a candidate's language ability, where fewer edits suggest better fluency. The count of edits can thus be viewed as a \\textit{fluency score} with zero implying perfect fluency. However, although deep learning based GEC systems are extremely powerful and accurate, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks: an adversary can introduce a small, specific change at the input of a system that causes a large, undesired change at the output. When considering the application of GEC systems to automated language assessment, the aim of an adversary could be to cheat by making a small change to a grammatically incorrect input sentence that conceals the errors from a GEC system, such that no edits are found and the candidate is unjustly awarded a perfect fluency score. This work examines a simple universal substitution adversarial attack that non-native speakers of English could realistically employ to deceive GEC systems used for assessment. ",

In this paper, we use Neural ODE as a lightweight model of ResNet to reduce communication size in federated learning. In addition, we newly introduce a flexible federated learning using Neural ODE models with different number of iterations, which correspond to ResNet with different depths. The CIFAR-10 dataset is used in the evaluation, and the use of Neural ODE reduces communication size by approximately 90% compared to ResNet.

In this work, we propose a neural approach that estimates the 5D HDR light field from a single image, and a differentiable object insertion formulation that enables end-to-end training with image-based losses that encourage realism. Specifically, we design a hybrid lighting representation tailored to outdoor scenes, which contains an HDR sky dome that handles the extreme intensity of the sun, and a volumetric lighting representation that models the spatially-varying appearance of the surrounding scene. With the estimated lighting, our shadow-aware object insertion is fully differentiable, which enables adversarial training over the composited image to provide additional supervisory signal to the lighting prediction. We experimentally demonstrate that our hybrid lighting representation is more performant than existing outdoor lighting estimation methods. We further show the benefits of our AR object insertion in an autonomous driving application, where we obtain performance gains for a 3D object detector when trained on our augmented data. ",

    "abstract": "Discovering the underlying dynamics of complex systems from data is an important practical topic. Constrained optimization algorithms are widely utilized and lead to many successes. Yet, such purely data-driven methods may bring about incorrect physics in the presence of random noise and cannot easily handle the situation with incomplete data. In this paper, a new iterative learning algorithm for complex turbulent systems with partial observations is developed that alternates between identifying model structures, recovering unobserved variables, and estimating parameters. First, a causality-based learning approach is utilized for the sparse identification of model structures, which takes into account certain physics knowledge that is pre-learned from data. It has unique advantages in coping with indirect coupling between features and is robust to the stochastic noise. A practical algorithm is designed to facilitate the causal inference for high-dimensional systems. Next, a systematic nonlinear stochastic parameterization is built to characterize the time evolution of the unobserved variables. Closed analytic formula via an efficient nonlinear data assimilation is exploited to sample the trajectories of the unobserved variables, which are then treated as synthetic observations to advance a rapid parameter estimation. Furthermore, the localization of the state variable dependence and the physics constraints are incorporated into the learning procedure, which mitigate the curse of dimensionality and prevent the finite time blow-up issue. Numerical experiments show that the new algorithm succeeds in identifying the model structure and providing suitable stochastic parameterizations for many complex nonlinear systems with chaotic dynamics, spatiotemporal multiscale structures, intermittency, and extreme events.

    "title": "PrepNet: A Convolutional Auto-Encoder to Homogenize CT Scans for  Cross-Dataset Medical Image Analysis",
    "abstract": "With the spread of COVID-19 over the world, the need arose for fast and precise automatic triage mechanisms to decelerate the spread of the disease by reducing human efforts e.g. for image-based diagnosis. Although the literature has shown promising efforts in this direction, reported results do not consider the variability of CT scans acquired under varying circumstances, thus rendering resulting models unfit for use on data acquired using e.g. different scanner technologies. While COVID-19 diagnosis can now be done efficiently using PCR tests, this use case exemplifies the need for a methodology to overcome data variability issues in order to make medical image analysis models more widely applicable. In this paper, we explicitly address the variability issue using the example of COVID-19 diagnosis and propose a novel generative approach that aims at erasing the differences induced by e.g. the imaging technology while simultaneously introducing minimal changes to the CT scans through leveraging the idea of deep auto-encoders. The proposed prepossessing architecture (PrepNet) (i) is jointly trained on multiple CT scan datasets and (ii) is capable of extracting improved discriminative features for improved diagnosis. Experimental results on three public datasets (SARS-COVID-2, UCSD COVID-CT, MosMed) show that our model improves cross-dataset generalization by up to $11.84$ percentage points despite a minor drop in within dataset performance.
