    "title": "Contrastive Learning for Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Contrastive learning is commonly used as a method of self-supervised learning with the \"anchor\" and \"positive\" being two random augmentations of a given input image, and the \"negative\" is the set of all other images. However, the requirement of large batch sizes and memory banks has made it difficult and slow to train. This has motivated the rise of Supervised Contrasative approaches that overcome these problems by using annotated data. We look to further improve supervised contrastive learning by ranking classes based on their similarity, and observe the impact of human bias (in the form of ranking) on the learned representations. We feel this is an important question to address, as learning good feature embeddings has been a long sought after problem in computer vision. ",

However, performing such a task using deep learning techniques requires a large cell-level annotated dataset. Although previous studies have investigated the performance of contrastive self-supervised methods in tissue classification, the utility of this class of algorithms in cell identification and clustering is still unknown. In this work, we investigated the utility of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in cell clustering by proposing the Contrastive Cell Representation Learning (CCRL) model. Through comprehensive comparisons, we show that this model can outperform all currently available cell clustering models by a large margin across two datasets from different tissue types. More interestingly, the results show that our proposed model worked well with a few number of cell categories while the utility of SSL models has been mainly shown in the context of natural image datasets with large numbers of classes (e.g., ImageNet). The unsupervised representation learning approach proposed in this research eliminates the time-consuming step of data annotation in cell classification tasks, which enables us to train our model on a much larger dataset compared to previous methods. Therefore, considering the promising outcome, this approach can open a new avenue to automatic cell representation learning. ",

    "abstract": "Automatic detection of traffic accidents is an important emerging topic in traffic monitoring systems. Nowadays many urban intersections are equipped with surveillance cameras connected to traffic management systems. Therefore, computer vision techniques can be viable tools for automatic accident detection. This paper presents a new efficient framework for accident detection at intersections for traffic surveillance applications. The proposed framework consists of three hierarchical steps, including efficient and accurate object detection based on the state-of-the-art YOLOv4 method, object tracking based on Kalman filter coupled with the Hungarian algorithm for association, and accident detection by trajectory conflict analysis. A new cost function is applied for object association to accommodate for occlusion, overlapping objects, and shape changes in the object tracking step. The object trajectories are analyzed in terms of velocity, angle, and distance in order to detect different types of trajectory conflicts including vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-pedestrian, and vehicle-to-bicycle. Experimental results using real traffic video data show the feasibility of the proposed method in real-time applications of traffic surveillance. In particular, trajectory conflicts, including near-accidents and accidents occurring at urban intersections are detected with a low false alarm rate and a high detection rate. The robustness of the proposed framework is evaluated using video sequences collected from YouTube with diverse illumination conditions. The dataset is publicly available at: this http URL ",

However, NAS methods are often complex and tend to converge to local minima as soon as generated architectures seem to yield good results. This paper proposes GEA, a novel approach for guided NAS. GEA guides the evolution by exploring the search space by generating and evaluating several architectures in each generation at initialisation stage using a zero-proxy estimator, where only the highest-scoring architecture is trained and kept for the next generation. Subsequently, GEA continuously extracts knowledge about the search space without increased complexity by generating several off-springs from an existing architecture at each generation. More, GEA forces exploitation of the most performant architectures by descendant generation while simultaneously driving exploration through parent mutation and favouring younger architectures to the detriment of older ones. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and extensive ablation studies evaluate the importance of different parameters. Results show that GEA achieves state-of-the-art results on all data sets of NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201 and TransNAS-Bench-101 benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Open data sets that contain personal information are susceptible to adversarial attacks even when anonymized. By performing low-cost joins on multiple datasets with shared attributes, malicious users of open data portals might get access to information that violates individuals' privacy. However, open data sets are primarily published using a release-and-forget model, whereby data owners and custodians have little to no cognizance of these privacy risks. We address this critical gap by developing a visual analytic solution that enables data defenders to gain awareness about the disclosure risks in local, joinable data neighborhoods. The solution is derived through a design study with data privacy researchers, where we initially play the role of a red team and engage in an ethical data hacking exercise based on privacy attack scenarios. We use this problem and domain characterization to develop a set of visual analytic interventions as a defense mechanism and realize them in PRIVEE, a visual risk inspection workflow that acts as a proactive monitor for data defenders. PRIVEE uses a combination of risk scores and associated interactive visualizations to let data defenders explore vulnerable joins and interpret risks at multiple levels of data granularity. We demonstrate how PRIVEE can help emulate the attack strategies and diagnose disclosure risks through two case studies with data privacy experts. ",

    "abstract": "Question answering over temporal knowledge graphs (TKGQA) has recently found increasing interest. TKGQA requires temporal reasoning techniques to extract the relevant information from temporal knowledge bases. The only existing TKGQA dataset, i.e., CronQuestions, consists of temporal questions based on the facts from a fixed time period, where a temporal knowledge graph (TKG) spanning the same period can be fully used for answer inference, allowing the TKGQA models to use even the future knowledge to answer the questions based on the past facts. In real-world scenarios, however, it is also common that given the knowledge until now, we wish the TKGQA systems to answer the questions asking about the future. As humans constantly seek plans for the future, building TKGQA systems for answering such forecasting questions is important. Nevertheless, this has still been unexplored in previous research. In this paper, we propose a novel task: forecasting question answering over temporal knowledge graphs. We also propose a large-scale TKGQA benchmark dataset, i.e., ForecastTKGQuestions, for this task. It includes three types of questions, i.e., entity prediction, yes-no, and fact reasoning questions. For every forecasting question in our dataset, QA models can only have access to the TKG information before the timestamp annotated in the given question for answer inference. We find that the state-of-the-art TKGQA methods perform poorly on forecasting questions, and they are unable to answer yes-no questions and fact reasoning questions. To this end, we propose ForecastTKGQA, a TKGQA model that employs a TKG forecasting module for future inference, to answer all three types of questions. Experimental results show that ForecastTKGQA outperforms recent TKGQA methods on the entity prediction questions, and it also shows great effectiveness in answering the other two types of questions.

By analyzing and comparing the outputs of such models, it is possible to gain a better understanding of the system itself. Though, as the complexity of model outputs increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to compare simulations to each other. While it is straightforward to only compare a few specific model outputs across multiple simulations, it is more informative to be able to compare model simulations as a whole. However, it is difficult to holistically compare model simulations in an unbiased manner. To address these limitations, we use Siamese neural networks to compare model simulations as a single value, with the neural networks capturing the relationships between the model outputs. We provide an approach to training Siamese networks on model simulations and display how the trained networks can then be used to provide a holistic comparison of model outputs. This approach can be applied to a wide range of model types, providing a quantitative method of analyzing the complex outputs of computational models. ",

    "abstract": "The opacity of neural networks leads their vulnerability to backdoor attacks, where hidden attention of infected neurons is triggered to override normal predictions to the attacker-chosen ones. In this paper, we propose a novel backdoor defense method to mark and purify the infected neurons in the backdoored neural networks. Specifically, we first define a new metric, called benign salience. By combining the first-order gradient to retain the connections between neurons, benign salience can identify the infected neurons with higher accuracy than the commonly used metric in backdoor defense. Then, a new Adaptive Regularization (AR) mechanism is proposed to assist in purifying these identified infected neurons via fine-tuning. Due to the ability to adapt to different magnitudes of parameters, AR can provide faster and more stable convergence than the common regularization mechanism in neuron purifying. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can erase the backdoor in neural networks with negligible performance degradation. ",

However, crafted AEs always present poor transferability. In this paper, by regarding the transferability of AEs as generalization ability of the model, we reveal that vanilla black-box attacks craft AEs via solving a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem. For MLE, the results probably are model-specific local optimum when available data is small, i.e., limiting the transferability of AEs. By contrast, we re-formulate crafting transferable AEs as the maximizing a posteriori probability estimation problem, which is an effective approach to boost the generalization of results with limited available data. Because Bayes posterior inference is commonly intractable, a simple yet effective method called MaskBlock is developed to approximately estimate. Moreover, we show that the formulated framework is a generalization version for various attack methods. Extensive experiments illustrate MaskBlock can significantly improve the transferability of crafted adversarial examples by up to about 20%. ",

At first our method models each source or target video by a graph: nodes represent video frames and edges represent the temporal or visual similarity relationship between frames. We use a graph attention network to learn the weight of individual frames and simultaneously align the source and target video into a domain-invariant graph feature space. Instead of storing a large number of sub-videos, our method only constructs one graph with a graph attention mechanism for one video, reducing the memory cost substantially.

    "abstract": "With the advancement of modern robotics, autonomous agents are now capable of hosting sophisticated algorithms, which enables them to make intelligent decisions. But developing and testing such algorithms directly in real-world systems is tedious and may result in the wastage of valuable resources. Especially for heterogeneous multi-agent systems in battlefield environments where communication is critical in determining the system's behavior and usability. Due to the necessity of simulators of separate paradigms (co-simulation) to simulate such scenarios before deploying, synchronization between those simulators is vital. Existing works aimed at resolving this issue fall short of addressing diversity among deployed agents. In this work, we propose \\textit{SynchroSim}, an integrated co-simulation middleware to simulate a heterogeneous multi-robot system. Here we propose a velocity difference-driven adjustable window size approach with a view to reducing packet loss probability. It takes into account the respective velocities of deployed agents to calculate a suitable window size before transmitting data between them. We consider our algorithm-specific simulator agnostic but for the sake of implementation results, we have used Gazebo as a Physics simulator and NS-3 as a network simulator. Also, we design our algorithm considering the Perception-Action loop inside a closed communication channel, which is one of the essential factors in a contested scenario with the requirement of high fidelity in terms of data transmission. We validate our approach empirically at both the simulation and system level for both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Our approach achieves a noticeable improvement in terms of reducing packet loss probability ($\\approx$11\\%), and average packet delay ($\\approx$10\\%) compared to the fixed window size-based synchronization approach.

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks have been shown to be a serious security threat against deep learning models, and detecting whether a given model has been backdoored becomes a crucial task. Existing defenses are mainly built upon the observation that the backdoor trigger is usually of small size or affects the activation of only a few neurons. However, the above observations are violated in many cases especially for advanced backdoor attacks, hindering the performance and applicability of the existing defenses. In this paper, we propose a backdoor defense DTInspector built upon a new observation. That is, an effective backdoor attack usually requires high prediction confidence on the poisoned training samples, so as to ensure that the trained model exhibits the targeted behavior with a high probability. Based on this observation, DTInspector first learns a patch that could change the predictions of most high-confidence data, and then decides the existence of backdoor by checking the ratio of prediction changes after applying the learned patch on the low-confidence data. Extensive evaluations on five backdoor attacks, four datasets, and three advanced attacking types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed defense. ",

Given an input portrait image, instead of estimating the corresponding alpha matte, we focus on the other end, to subtly enhance this input so that the alpha matte can be easily estimated by any existing matting models. This is accomplished by exploring the latent space of GAN models. It is demonstrated that interpretable directions can be found in the latent space and they correspond to semantic image transformations. We further explore this property in alpha matting. Particularly, we invert an input portrait into the latent code of StyleGAN, and our aim is to discover whether there is an enhanced version in the latent space which is more compatible with a reference matting model. We optimize multi-scale latent vectors in the latent spaces under four tailored losses, ensuring matting-specificity and subtle modifications on the portrait. We demonstrate that the proposed method can refine real portrait images for arbitrary matting models, boosting the performance of automatic alpha matting by a large margin. In addition, we leverage the generative property of StyleGAN, and propose to generate enhanced portrait data which can be treated as the pseudo GT.

In this paper, we improve CANnolo, an RNN-based state-of-the-art IDS for CAN, by proposing CANdito, an unsupervised IDS that exploits Long Short-Term Memory autoencoders to detect anomalies through a signal reconstruction process. We evaluate CANdito by measuring its effectiveness against a comprehensive set of synthetic attacks injected in a real-world CAN dataset. We demonstrate the improvement of CANdito with respect to CANnolo on a real-world dataset injected with a comprehensive set of attacks, both in terms of detection and temporal performances. ",

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in the task of graph classification and diverse downstream real-world applications. Despite their success, existing approaches are either limited to structure attacks or restricted to local information. This calls for a more general attack framework on graph classification, which faces significant challenges due to the complexity of generating local-node-level adversarial examples using the global-graph-level information. To address this \"global-to-local\" problem, we present a general framework CAMA to generate adversarial examples by manipulating graph structure and node features in a hierarchical style. Specifically, we make use of Graph Class Activation Mapping and its variant to produce node-level importance corresponding to the graph classification task. Then through a heuristic design of algorithms, we can perform both feature and structure attacks under unnoticeable perturbation budgets with the help of both node-level and subgraph-level importance. Experiments towards attacking four state-of-the-art graph classification models on six real-world benchmarks verify the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework. ",

However, fragmented layers could degrade the code quality without being merged into a whole part if all of them are involved in the code generation. In this paper, we propose a pipeline to merge fragmented layers automatically. We first construct a graph representation for the layer tree of a UI draft and detect all fragmented layers based on the visual features and graph neural networks. Then a rule-based algorithm is designed to merge fragmented layers. Through experiments on a newly constructed dataset, our approach can retrieve most fragmented layers in UI design drafts, and achieve 87% accuracy in the detection task, and the post-processing algorithm is developed to cluster associative layers under simple and general circumstances.

    "abstract": "Structured pruning techniques have achieved great compression performance on convolutional neural networks for image classification task. However, the majority of existing methods are weight-oriented, and their pruning results may be unsatisfactory when the original model is trained poorly. That is, a fully-trained model is required to provide useful weight information. This may be time-consuming, and the pruning results are sensitive to the updating process of model parameters. In this paper, we propose a metric named Average Filter Information Entropy (AFIE) to measure the importance of each filter. It is calculated by three major steps, i.e., low-rank decomposition of the \"input-output\" matrix of each convolutional layer, normalization of the obtained eigenvalues, and calculation of filter importance based on information entropy. By leveraging the proposed AFIE, the proposed framework is able to yield a stable importance evaluation of each filter no matter whether the original model is trained fully. We implement our AFIE based on AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-50, and test them on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet, respectively. The experimental results are encouraging. We surprisingly observe that for our methods, even when the original model is only trained with one epoch, the importance evaluation of each filter keeps identical to the results when the model is fully-trained. This indicates that the proposed pruning strategy can perform effectively at the beginning stage of the training process for the original model. ",

The proposed system model is built up considering one base station (BS), one RIS, and two users. With the goal of minimizing the network energy consumption, a joint framework to optimize the precoding vectors at the BS, common stream split, relaying device transmit power, the time slot allocation, and the passive beamforming at the RIS subject to the power budget constraints at both the BS and the relaying node, the quality of service (QoS) constraints at both users, and common stream rate constraint is proposed. The formulated problem is a non-convex optimization problem due to the high coupling among the optimization variables. To tackle this challenge, an efficient algorithm is presented by invoking the alternating optimization technique, which decomposes the original problem into two sub-problems; namely, sub-problem-1 and sub-problem-2, which are alternatively solved. Specifically, sub-problem-1 is to jointly optimize the precoding vectors, common stream split, and relaying device power. Meanwhile, sub-problem-2 is to optimize the phase shift matrix at the RIS. In order to solve sub-problem-1, an efficient low-complexity solution based on the successive convex approximation (SCA) is proposed. Meanwhile, and with the aid of difference-of-convex rank-one representation and the SCA approach, an efficient solution for the phase shift matrix at the RIS is obtained. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RIS-assisted HD C-RSMA achieves a significant gain in minimizing the total energy consumption compared to the RIS-assisted RSMA scheme, RIS-assisted HD cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA), RIS-assisted NOMA, HD C-RSMA without RIS, and HD C-NOMA without RIS.

Their remarkable success has helped vision science break new ground. Consequently, recent efforts have started to transfer this achievement to the domain of biological face recognition. In this regard, face detection can be investigated through comparisons of face-selective biological areas and neurons to artificial layers and units. Similarly, face identification can be examined through comparisons of in vivo and in silico face space representations. In this mini-review, we summarize the first studies with this aim. We argue that DCNNs are useful models, which follow the general hierarchical organization of biological face recognition. In two spotlights, we emphasize unique scientific contributions of these models. Firstly, studies on face detection in DCNNs propose that elementary face-selectivity emerges automatically through feedforward processes. Secondly, studies on face identification in DCNNs suggest that experience and additional generative mechanisms are required for this challenge. Taken together, as this novel computational approach enables close control of predisposition (i.e., architecture) and experience (i.e., training data), this could also inform longstanding debates on the substrates of biological face recognition.

An instruction embedding model is a neural network that transforms sequences of assembly instructions into embedding vectors. If the embedding network is trained such that the translation from code to vectors partially preserves the semantic, the network effectively represents an assembly code model. In this paper we present BinBert, a novel assembly code model. BinBert is built on a transformer pre-trained on a huge dataset of both assembly instruction sequences and symbolic execution information. BinBert can be applied to assembly instructions sequences and it is fine-tunable, i.e. it can be re-trained as part of a neural architecture on task-specific data. Through fine-tuning, BinBert learns how to apply the general knowledge acquired with pre-training to the specific task. We evaluated BinBert on a multi-task benchmark that we specifically designed to test the understanding of assembly code. The benchmark is composed of several tasks, some taken from the literature, and a few novel tasks that we designed, with a mix of intrinsic and downstream tasks. Our results show that BinBert outperforms state-of-the-art models for binary instruction embedding, raising the bar for binary code understanding. ",

Furthermore, high-resolution light field networks can exhibit flickering and aliasing as neural networks are sampled without appropriate filtering. To resolve these issues, we present a progressive multi-scale light field network that encodes a light field with multiple levels of detail. Lower levels of detail are encoded using fewer neural network weights enabling progressive streaming and reducing rendering time. Our progressive multi-scale light field network addresses aliasing by encoding smaller anti-aliased representations at its lower levels of detail. Additionally, per-pixel level of detail enables our representation to support dithered transitions and foveated rendering. ",

The method adds a term involving a control Lyapunov function (CLF) -- an `energy-like' function from the model-based control literature -- to typical cost formulations. Theoretical results demonstrate the new costs lead to stabilizing controllers when smaller discount factors are used, which is well-known to reduce sample complexity. Moreover, the addition of the CLF term `robustifies' the search for a stabilizing controller by ensuring that even highly sub-optimal polices will stabilize the system. We demonstrate our approach with two hardware examples where we learn stabilizing controllers for a cartpole and an A1 quadruped with only seconds and a few minutes of fine-tuning data, respectively.

However, most GNN methods adopt a supervised learning setting, which is not always feasible in real-world applications due to the difficulty to obtain labeled data. Hence, graph self-supervised learning has been attracting increasing attention. Graph contrastive learning (GCL) is a representative framework for self-supervised learning. In general, GCL learns node representations by contrasting semantically similar nodes (positive samples) and dissimilar nodes (negative samples) with anchor nodes. Without access to labels, positive samples are typically generated by data augmentation, and negative samples are uniformly sampled from the entire graph, which leads to a sub-optimal objective. Specifically, data augmentation naturally limits the number of positive samples that involve in the process (typically only one positive sample is adopted). On the other hand, the random sampling process would inevitably select false-negative samples (samples sharing the same semantics with the anchor). These issues limit the learning capability of GCL. In this work, we propose an enhanced objective that addresses the aforementioned issues. We first introduce an unachievable ideal objective that contains all positive samples and no false-negative samples. This ideal objective is then transformed into a probabilistic form based on the distributions for sampling positive and negative samples. We then model these distributions with node similarity and derive the enhanced objective. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed enhanced objective under different settings. ",

By facilitating labeled links of the graph as the training data, numerous deep learning based link prediction methods have been studied, which have dominant prediction accuracy compared with non-deep methods. However,the threats of maliciously crafted training graph will leave a specific backdoor in the deep model, thus when some specific examples are fed into the model, it will make wrong prediction, defined as backdoor attack. It is an important aspect that has been overlooked in the current literature. In this paper, we prompt the concept of backdoor attack on link prediction, and propose Link-Backdoor to reveal the training vulnerability of the existing link prediction methods. Specifically, the Link-Backdoor combines the fake nodes with the nodes of the target link to form a trigger. Moreover, it optimizes the trigger by the gradient information from the target model. Consequently, the link prediction model trained on the backdoored dataset will predict the link with trigger to the target state. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets and five well-performing link prediction models demonstrate that the Link-Backdoor achieves the state-of-the-art attack success rate under both white-box (i.e., available of the target model parameter)and black-box (i.e., unavailable of the target model parameter) scenarios. Additionally, we testify the attack under defensive circumstance, and the results indicate that the Link-Backdoor still can construct successful attack on the well-performing link prediction methods.

However, with growing demands for such technologies, the limited energy infrastructure becomes the bottleneck for their future growth. It might be of high cost and low energy efficiency for all the operators to each have their own dedicated energy infrastructure, such as charging stations. In this paper, we analyze a wireless charging infrastructure sharing strategy in UAV and EV-involved networks. We consider a scenario where UAVs can charge in EV charging stations and pay for the sharing fee. On the EVs' side, sharing infrastructure can earn extra profit but their service quality, such as waiting time, might slightly reduce. On the UAVs' side, if renting EV charging stations can achieve an acceptable system performance, say high coverage probability, while considering the cost, they may not need to build their dedicated charging stations. In this case, we use tools from stochastic geometry to model the locations and propose an optimization problem that captures the aforementioned trade-offs between cost or profit and quality of service. Our numerical results show that sharing infrastructure slightly increases the waiting time of EVs, say within $5$ min, but dramatically decreases the waiting time of drones, say more than $50$ min, and deploying more charging stations do achieve better performances, but all these better performances are expected to cost more.

We leverage that knowledge by training BERT, Sentence-BERT (SBERT), and Character-level-CNN models and capturing the nuances via the last layers that form the Phishing Psychological Trait (PPT) scores. For the phishing email detection task, we use the pretrained BERT and SBERT model, and concatenate the PPT scores to feed into a fully-connected neural network model. Our results show that the addition of PPT scores improves the model performance significantly, thus indicating the effectiveness of PPT scores in capturing the psychological nuances. Furthermore, to mitigate the effect of the imbalanced training dataset, we use the GPT-2 model to generate phishing emails (Radford et al., 2019). Our best model outperforms the current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) model's F1 score by 4.54%. Additionally, our analysis of individual PPTs suggests that Fear provides the strongest cue in detecting phishing emails. ",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal activity prediction, aiming to predict user activities at a specific location and time, is crucial for applications like urban planning and mobile advertising. Existing solutions based on tensor decomposition or graph embedding suffer from the following two major limitations: 1) ignoring the fine-grained similarities of user preferences; 2) user's modeling is entangled. In this work, we propose a hypergraph neural network model called DisenHCN to bridge the above gaps. In particular, we first unify the fine-grained user similarity and the complex matching between user preferences and spatiotemporal activity into a heterogeneous hypergraph. We then disentangle the user representations into different aspects (location-aware, time-aware, and activity-aware) and aggregate corresponding aspect's features on the constructed hypergraph, capturing high-order relations from different aspects and disentangles the impact of each aspect for final prediction. Extensive experiments show that our DisenHCN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by 14.23% to 18.10% on four real-world datasets. Further studies also convincingly verify the rationality of each component in our DisenHCN. ",

    "abstract": "Agent assistance during human-human customer support spoken interactions requires triggering workflows based on the caller's intent (reason for call). Timeliness of prediction is essential for a good user experience. The goal is for a system to detect the caller's intent at the time the agent would have been able to detect it (Intent Boundary). Some approaches focus on predicting the output offline, i.e. once the full spoken input (e.g. the whole conversational turn) has been processed by the ASR system. This introduces an undesirable latency in the prediction each time the intent could have been detected earlier in the turn. Recent work on voice assistants has used incremental real-time predictions at a word-by-word level to detect intent before the end of a command. Human-directed and machine-directed speech however have very different characteristics. In this work, we propose to apply a method developed in the context of voice-assistant to the problem of online real time caller's intent detection in human-human spoken interactions. We use a dual architecture in which two LSTMs are jointly trained: one predicting the Intent Boundary (IB) and then other predicting the intent class at the IB. We conduct our experiments on our private dataset comprising transcripts of human-human telephone conversations from the telecom customer support domain. We report results analyzing both the accuracy of our system as well as the impact of different architectures on the trade off between overall accuracy and prediction latency. ",

    "abstract": "The architectural advancements in deep neural networks have led to remarkable leap-forwards across a broad array of computer vision tasks. Instead of relying on human expertise, neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged as a promising avenue toward automating the design of architectures. While recent achievements in image classification have suggested opportunities, the promises of NAS have yet to be thoroughly assessed on more challenging tasks of semantic segmentation. The main challenges of applying NAS to semantic segmentation arise from two aspects: (i) high-resolution images to be processed; (ii) additional requirement of real-time inference speed (i.e., real-time semantic segmentation) for applications such as autonomous driving. To meet such challenges, we propose a surrogate-assisted multi-objective method in this paper. Through a series of customized prediction models, our method effectively transforms the original NAS task into an ordinary multi-objective optimization problem. Followed by a hierarchical pre-screening criterion for in-fill selection, our method progressively achieves a set of efficient architectures trading-off between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. Empirical evaluations on three benchmark datasets together with an application using Huawei Atlas 200 DK suggest that our method can identify architectures significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art architectures designed both manually by human experts and automatically by other NAS methods.

When dealing with complex and realistic scenarios, constructing a transformation to the sphere world is essential and, at the same time, challenging. This work proposes a novel transformation termed the conformal navigation transformation to achieve collision-free navigation of a robot in a workspace populated with obstacles of arbitrary shapes. The properties of the conformal navigation transformation, including uniqueness, invariance of navigation properties, and no angular deformation, are investigated, which contribute to the solution of the robot navigation problem in complex environments. Based on navigation functions and the proposed transformation, feedback controllers are derived for the automatic guidance and motion control of kinematic and dynamic mobile robots. Moreover, an iterative method is proposed to construct the conformal navigation transformation in a multi-connected workspace, which transforms the multi-connected problem into multiple single-connected problems to achieve fast convergence. In addition to the analytic guarantees, simulation studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in workspaces with non-trivial obstacles. ",

This problem arises when using 4K high dynamic range (HDR) TVs to watch a low-resolution standard dynamic range (LR SDR) video. Previous methods that rely on learning local information typically cannot do well in preserving color conformity and long-range structural similarity, resulting in unnatural color transition and texture artifacts. In order to tackle these challenges, we propose a global priors guided modulation network (GPGMNet) for joint SR-ITM. In particular, we design a global priors extraction module (GPEM) to extract color conformity prior and structural similarity prior that are beneficial for ITM and SR tasks, respectively. To further exploit the global priors and preserve spatial information, we devise multiple global priors guided spatial-wise modulation blocks (GSMBs) with a few parameters for intermediate feature modulation, in which the modulation parameters are generated by the shared global priors and the spatial features map from the spatial pyramid convolution block (SPCB). With these elaborate designs, the GPGMNet can achieve higher visual quality with lower computational complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed GPGMNet is superior to the state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our proposed model exceeds the state-of-the-art by 0.64 dB in PSNR, with 69$\\%$ fewer parameters and 3.1$\\times$ speedup. The code will be released soon. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks used for image classification often use convolutional filters to extract distinguishing features before passing them to a linear classifier. Most interpretability literature focuses on providing semantic meaning to convolutional filters to explain a model's reasoning process and confirm its use of relevant information from the input domain. Fully connected layers can be studied by decomposing their weight matrices using a singular value decomposition, in effect studying the correlations between the rows in each matrix to discover the dynamics of the map. In this work we define a singular value decomposition for the weight tensor of a convolutional layer, which provides an analogous understanding of the correlations between filters, exposing the dynamics of the convolutional map. We validate our definition using recent results in random matrix theory. By applying the decomposition across the linear layers of an image classification network we suggest a framework against which interpretability methods might be applied using hypergraphs to model class separation. Rather than looking to the activations to explain the network, we use the singular vectors with the greatest corresponding singular values for each linear layer to identify those features most important to the network. We illustrate our approach with examples and introduce the DeepDataProfiler library, the analysis tool used for this study. ",

Recently, the addition of convolutional layers to combine the feature extraction power of convolutional networks with the computational efficiency of SNNs has been introduced. In this paper, the feasibility of using a convolutional spiking neural network (CSNN) as a classifier to detect anticipatory slow cortical potentials related to braking intention in human participants using an electroencephalogram (EEG) was studied. The EEG data was collected during an experiment wherein participants operated a remote controlled vehicle on a testbed designed to simulate an urban environment. Participants were alerted to an incoming braking event via an audio countdown to elicit anticipatory potentials that were then measured using an EEG. The CSNN's performance was compared to a standard convolutional neural network (CNN) and three graph neural networks (GNNs) via 10-fold cross-validation. The results showed that the CSNN outperformed the other neural networks. ",

However, in the vanilla version of backpropagation in deep learning, all gradients (which can be understood to comprise of both signal and noise gradients) flow through the network during weight updates. This may lead to overfitting. In this work, inspired by biological lateral inhibition, we propose Gradient Mask, which effectively filters out noise gradients in the process of backpropagation. This allows the learned feature information to be more intensively stored in the network while filtering out noisy or unimportant features. Furthermore, we demonstrate analytically how lateral inhibition in artificial neural networks improves the quality of propagated gradients. A new criterion for gradient quality is proposed which can be used as a measure during training of various convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Finally, we conduct several different experiments to study how Gradient Mask improves the performance of the network both quantitatively and qualitatively. Quantitatively, accuracy in the original CNN architecture, accuracy after pruning, and accuracy after adversarial attacks have shown improvements. Qualitatively, the CNN trained using Gradient Mask has developed saliency maps that focus primarily on the object of interest, which is useful for data augmentation and network interpretability. ",

Existing ordering-based methods in the literature recover a graph through learning a causal order (c-order). We advocate for a novel order called removable order (r-order) as they are advantageous over c-orders for structure learning. This is because r-orders are the minimizers of an appropriately defined optimization problem that could be either solved exactly (using a reinforcement learning approach) or approximately (using a hill-climbing search). Moreover, the r-orders (unlike c-orders) are invariant among all the graphs in a MEC and include c-orders as a subset. Given that set of r-orders is often significantly larger than the set of c-orders, it is easier for the optimization problem to find an r-order instead of a c-order. We evaluate the performance and the scalability of our proposed approaches on both real-world and randomly generated networks. ",

Recently, the data augmentation based contrastive learning method has advanced to show great power in the visual domain, and some works extended this method from images to graphs. However, unlike the data augmentation on images, the data augmentation on graphs is far less intuitive and much harder to provide high-quality contrastive samples, which leaves much space for improvement. In this work, by introducing an adversarial graph view for data augmentation, we propose a simple but effective method, Adversarial Graph Contrastive Learning (ARIEL), to extract informative contrastive samples within reasonable constraints. We develop a new technique called information regularization for stable training and use subgraph sampling for scalability. We generalize our method from node-level contrastive learning to the graph-level by treating each graph instance as a supernode. ARIEL consistently outperforms the current graph contrastive learning methods for both node-level and graph-level classification tasks on real-world datasets. We further demonstrate that ARIEL is more robust in face of adversarial attacks. ",

Given that the inference stage of GNNs can be naturally implemented in a decentralized manner, GNN is a potential enabler for decentralized control/management in the next-generation wireless communications. Privacy leakage, however, may occur due to the information exchanges among neighbors during decentralized inference with GNNs. To deal with this issue, in this paper, we analyze and enhance the privacy of decentralized inference with GNNs in wireless networks. Specifically, we adopt local differential privacy as the metric, and design novel privacy-preserving signals as well as privacy-guaranteed training algorithms to achieve privacy-preserving inference.

To further enhance the communication and computation efficiency, we adopt the over-the-air computation technique and theoretically demonstrate its advantage in privacy preservation.

The essence of STAR-GNN is to exploit both the temporal dynamics and spatial contents as well as visual connections between regions at different scales in the frames. It models a video with a lattice feature graph in which the nodes represent regions of different granularity, with weighted edges that represent the spatial and temporal links. The contextual nodes are aggregated simultaneously by graph neural networks with parameters trained with retrieval triplet loss. In the experiments, we show that STAR-GNN effectively implements a dynamic attention mechanism on video frame sequences, resulting in the emphasis for dynamic and semantically rich content in the video, and is robust to noise and redundancies. Empirical results show that STAR-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance for Content-Based Video Retrieval. ",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in social event detection tasks when restricted to a closed set of events. However, considering the large amount of data needed for training a neural network and the limited ability of a neural network in handling previously unknown data, it remains a challenge for existing GNN-based methods to operate in an open set setting. To address this problem, we design a Quality-aware Self-improving Graph Neural Network (QSGNN) which extends the knowledge from known to unknown by leveraging the best of known samples and reliable knowledge transfer. Specifically, to fully exploit the labeled data, we propose a novel supervised pairwise loss with an additional orthogonal inter-class relation constraint to train the backbone GNN encoder. The learnt, already-known events further serve as strong reference bases for the unknown ones, which greatly prompts knowledge acquisition and transfer. When the model is generalized to unknown data, to ensure the effectiveness and reliability, we further leverage the reference similarity distribution vectors for pseudo pairwise label generation, selection and quality assessment. Following the diversity principle of active learning, our method selects diverse pair samples with the generated pseudo labels to fine-tune the GNN encoder. Besides, we propose a novel quality-guided optimization in which the contributions of pseudo labels are weighted based on consistency. We thoroughly evaluate our model on two large real-world social event datasets. Experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results and extends well to unknown events. ",

    "abstract": "Graph coloring, a classical and critical NP-hard problem, is the problem of assigning connected nodes as different colors as possible. However, we observe that state-of-the-art GNNs are less successful in the graph coloring problem. We analyze the reasons from two perspectives. First, most GNNs fail to generalize the task under homophily to heterophily, i.e., graphs where connected nodes are assigned different colors. Second, GNNs are bounded by the network depth, making them possible to be a local method, which has been demonstrated to be non-optimal in Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. In this paper, we focus on the aggregation-combine GNNs (AC-GNNs), a popular class of GNNs. We first define the power of AC-GNNs in the coloring problem as the capability to assign nodes different colors. The definition is different with previous one that is based on the assumption of homophily. We identify node pairs that AC-GNNs fail to discriminate. Furthermore, we show that any AC-GNN is a local coloring method, and any local coloring method is non-optimal by exploring the limits of local methods over sparse random graphs, thereby demonstrating the non-optimality of AC-GNNs due to its local property. We then prove the positive correlation between model depth and its coloring power. Moreover, we discuss the color equivariance of graphs to tackle some practical constraints such as the pre-fixing constraints. Following the discussions above, we summarize a series of rules a series of rules that make a GNN color equivariant and powerful in the coloring problem. Then, we propose a simple AC-GNN variation satisfying these rules. We empirically validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our simple model substantially outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms in both quality and runtime. ",

    "abstract": "Estimated time of arrival (ETA) prediction, also known as travel time estimation, is a fundamental task for a wide range of intelligent transportation applications, such as navigation, route planning, and ride-hailing services. To accurately predict the travel time of a route, it is essential to take into account both contextual and predictive factors, such as spatial-temporal interaction, driving behavior, and traffic congestion propagation inference. The ETA prediction models previously deployed at Baidu Maps have addressed the factors of spatial-temporal interaction (ConSTGAT) and driving behavior (SSML). In this work, we focus on modeling traffic congestion propagation patterns to improve ETA performance. Traffic congestion propagation pattern modeling is challenging, and it requires accounting for impact regions over time and cumulative effect of delay variations over time caused by traffic events on the road network. In this paper, we present a practical industrial-grade ETA prediction framework named DuETA. Specifically, we construct a congestion-sensitive graph based on the correlations of traffic patterns, and we develop a route-aware graph transformer to directly learn the long-distance correlations of the road segments. This design enables DuETA to capture the interactions between the road segment pairs that are spatially distant but highly correlated with traffic conditions. Extensive experiments are conducted on large-scale, real-world datasets collected from Baidu Maps. Experimental results show that ETA prediction can significantly benefit from the learned traffic congestion propagation patterns. In addition, DuETA has already been deployed in production at Baidu Maps, serving billions of requests every day. This demonstrates that DuETA is an industrial-grade and robust solution for large-scale ETA prediction services. ",

Recently, the introduction of attention condenser networks have resulted in low-footprint, highly-efficient, self-attention neural networks that strike a strong balance between accuracy and speed. In this study, we introduce a new faster attention condenser design called double-condensing attention condensers that enable more condensed feature embedding. We further employ a machine-driven design exploration strategy that imposes best practices design constraints for greater efficiency and robustness to produce the macro-micro architecture constructs of the backbone. The resulting backbone (which we name AttendNeXt) achieves significantly higher inference throughput on an embedded ARM processor when compared to several other state-of-the-art efficient backbones (>10X faster than FB-Net C at higher accuracy and speed) while having a small model size (>1.47X smaller than OFA-62 at higher speed and similar accuracy) and strong accuracy (1.1% higher top-1 accuracy than MobileViT XS on ImageNet at higher speed). These promising results demonstrate that exploring different efficient architecture designs and self-attention mechanisms can lead to interesting new building blocks for TinyML applications. ",

Recent studies show that well-designed adversarial defense strategies can improve the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial examples. However, with the rapid development of defense technologies, it also tends to be more difficult to evaluate the robustness of the defensed model due to the weak performance of existing manually designed adversarial attacks. To address the challenge, given the defensed model, the efficient adversarial attack with less computational burden and lower robust accuracy is needed to be further exploited. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective memetic algorithm for auto adversarial attack optimization design, which realizes the automatical search for the near-optimal adversarial attack towards defensed models. Firstly, the more general mathematical model of auto adversarial attack optimization design is constructed, where the search space includes not only the attacker operations, magnitude, iteration number, and loss functions but also the connection ways of multiple adversarial attacks. In addition, we develop a multi-objective memetic algorithm combining NSGA-II and local search to solve the optimization problem. Finally, to decrease the evaluation cost during the search, we propose a representative data selection strategy based on the sorting of cross entropy loss values of each images output by models. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "In medical imaging, surface registration is extensively used for performing systematic comparisons between anatomical structures, with a prime example being the highly convoluted brain cortical surfaces. To obtain a meaningful registration, a common approach is to identify prominent features on the surfaces and establish a low-distortion mapping between them with the feature correspondence encoded as landmark constraints. Prior registration works have primarily focused on using manually labeled landmarks and solving highly nonlinear optimization problems, which are time-consuming and hence hinder practical applications. In this work, we propose a novel framework for the automatic landmark detection and registration of brain cortical surfaces using quasi-conformal geometry and convolutional neural networks. We first develop a landmark detection network (LD-Net) that allows for the automatic extraction of landmark curves given two prescribed starting and ending points based on the surface geometry. We then utilize the detected landmarks and quasi-conformal theory for achieving the surface registration. Specifically, we develop a coefficient prediction network (CP-Net) for predicting the Beltrami coefficients associated with the desired landmark-based registration and a mapping network called the disk Beltrami solver network (DBS-Net) for generating quasi-conformal mappings from the predicted Beltrami coefficients, with the bijectivity guaranteed by quasi-conformal theory. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Altogether, our work paves a new way for surface-based morphometry and medical shape analysis. ",

Recently, some studies have discussed the importance of modeling neighborhood distribution on the graph. However, most existing GNNs aggregate neighbors' features through single statistic (e.g., mean, max, sum), which loses the information related to neighbor's feature distribution and therefore degrades the model performance. In this paper, inspired by the method of moment in statistical theory, we propose to model neighbor's feature distribution with multi-order moments. We design a novel GNN model, namely Mix-Moment Graph Neural Network (MM-GNN), which includes a Multi-order Moment Embedding (MME) module and an Element-wise Attention-based Moment Adaptor module. MM-GNN first calculates the multi-order moments of the neighbors for each node as signatures, and then use an Element-wise Attention-based Moment Adaptor to assign larger weights to important moments for each node and update node representations. We conduct extensive experiments on 15 real-world graphs (including social networks, citation networks and web-page networks etc.) to evaluate our model, and the results demonstrate the superiority of MM-GNN over existing state-of-the-art models.

Some existing stylization methods with neural radiance fields can effectively predict stylized scenes by combining the features of the style image with multi-view images to train 3D scenes. However, these methods generate novel view images that contain objectionable artifacts. Besides, they cannot achieve universal photorealistic stylization for a 3D scene. Therefore, a styling image must retrain a 3D scene representation network based on a neural radiation field. We propose a novel 3D scene photorealistic style transfer framework to address these issues. It can realize photorealistic 3D scene style transfer with a 2D style image. We first pre-trained a 2D photorealistic style transfer network, which can meet the photorealistic style transfer between any given content image and style image. Then, we use voxel features to optimize a 3D scene and get the geometric representation of the scene. Finally, we jointly optimize a hyper network to realize the scene photorealistic style transfer of arbitrary style images. In the transfer stage, we use a pre-trained 2D photorealistic network to constrain the photorealistic style of different views and different style images in the 3D scene. The experimental results show that our method not only realizes the 3D photorealistic style transfer of arbitrary style images but also outperforms the existing methods in terms of visual quality and consistency.

The main challenge resides in the need to identify from input utterances novel unseen in-tents. Herein, we propose Z-BERT-A, a two-stage method for intent discovery relying on a Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. 2017; Devlin et al. 2018), fine-tuned with Adapters (Pfeiffer et al. 2020), initially trained for Natural Language Inference (NLI), and later applied for unknown in-tent classification in a zero-shot setting. In our evaluation, we firstly analyze the quality of the model after adaptive fine-tuning on known classes. Secondly, we evaluate its performance casting intent classification as an NLI task. Lastly, we test the zero-shot performance of the model on unseen classes, showing how Z-BERT-A can effectively perform in-tent discovery by generating intents that are semantically similar, if not equal, to the ground truth ones. Our experiments show how Z-BERT-A is outperforming a wide variety of baselines in two zero-shot settings: known intents classification and unseen intent discovery. The proposed pipeline holds the potential to be widely applied in a variety of application for customer care. It enables automated dynamic triage using a lightweight model that, unlike large language models, can be easily deployed and scaled in a wide variety of business scenarios.

    "title": "CAME: Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts for Unbiased Scene Graph  Generation",
    "abstract": "The scene graph generation has gained tremendous progress in recent years. However, its intrinsic long-tailed distribution of predicate classes is a challenging problem. Almost all existing scene graph generation (SGG) methods follow the same framework where they use a similar backbone network for object detection and a customized network for scene graph generation. These methods often design the sophisticated context-encoder to extract the inherent relevance of scene context w.r.t the intrinsic predicates and complicated networks to improve the learning capabilities of the network model for highly imbalanced data distributions. To address the unbiased SGG problem, we present a simple yet effective method called Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (CAME) to improve the model diversity and alleviate the biased SGG without a sophisticated design. Specifically, we propose to use the mixture of experts to remedy the heavily long-tailed distributions of predicate classes, which is suitable for most unbiased scene graph generators. With a mixture of relation experts, the long-tailed distribution of predicates is addressed in a divide and ensemble manner. As a result, the biased SGG is mitigated and the model tends to make more balanced predicates predictions. However, experts with the same weight are not sufficiently diverse to discriminate the different levels of predicates distributions. Hence, we simply use the build-in context-aware encoder, to help the network dynamically leverage the rich scene characteristics to further increase the diversity of the model. By utilizing the context information of the image, the importance of each expert w.r.t the scene context is dynamically assigned. We have conducted extensive experiments on three tasks on the Visual Genome dataset to show that came achieved superior performance over previous methods. ",

    "abstract": "Predictive Coding Networks (PCNs) aim to learn a generative model of the world. Given observations, this generative model can then be inverted to infer the causes of those observations. However, when training PCNs, a noticeable pathology is often observed where inference accuracy peaks and then declines with further training. This cannot be explained by overfitting since both training and test accuracy decrease simultaneously. Here we provide a thorough investigation of this phenomenon and show that it is caused by an imbalance between the speeds at which the various layers of the PCN converge. We demonstrate that this can be prevented by regularising the weight matrices at each layer: by restricting the relative size of matrix singular values, we allow the weight matrix to change but restrict the overall impact which a layer can have on its neighbours. We also demonstrate that a similar effect can be achieved through a more biologically plausible and simple scheme of just capping the weights. ",

This upgrade is taken as an opportunity to exchange the currently used highly customized hardware by commercial solutions. Nevertheless, some part of the data processing still needs to be done within Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), requiring the transfer of data between the FPGAs and the commercial servers. This paper reports on a study of direct data transmission from FPGAs to servers via a commercial network. Large data buffers as required for reliable data-transmission protocols are avoided by using an emerging technique named eXpress Data Path (XDP).

With few studies focusing on the security of cross-chain bridges, the community still lacks the knowledge and tools to mitigate this significant threat. To bridge the gap, we conduct the first study on the security of cross-chain bridges. We document three new classes of security bugs and propose a set of security properties and patterns to characterize them. Based on those patterns, we design Xscope, an automatic tool to find security violations in cross-chain bridges and detect real-world attacks. We evaluate Xscope on four popular cross-chain bridges. It successfully detects all known attacks and finds suspicious attacks unreported before. A video of Xscope is available at https://youtu.be/vMRO_qOqtXY. ",

    "abstract": "Although large pre-trained models of code have delivered significant advancements in various code processing tasks, there is an impediment to the wide and fluent adoption of these powerful models in software developers' daily workflow: these large models consume hundreds of megabytes of memory and run slowly on personal devices, which causes problems in model deployment and greatly degrades the user experience. It motivates us to propose Compressor, a novel approach that can compress the pre-trained models of code into extremely small models with negligible performance sacrifice. Our proposed method formulates the design of tiny models as simplifying the pre-trained model architecture: searching for a significantly smaller model that follows an architectural design similar to the original pre-trained model. Compressor proposes a genetic algorithm (GA)-based strategy to guide the simplification process. Prior studies found that a model with higher computational cost tends to be more powerful. Inspired by this insight, the GA algorithm is designed to maximize a model's Giga floating-point operations (GFLOPs), an indicator of the model computational cost, to satisfy the constraint of the target model size. Then, we use the knowledge distillation technique to train the small model: unlabelled data is fed into the large model and the outputs are used as labels to train the small model. We evaluate Compressor with two state-of-the-art pre-trained models, i.e., CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT, on two important tasks, i.e., vulnerability prediction and clone detection. We use our method to compress pre-trained models to a size (3 MB), which is 160$\\times$ smaller than the original size. The results show that compressed CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT are 4.31$\\times$ and 4.15$\\times$ faster than the original model at inference, respectively. More importantly, ... ",

However, it still suffers from the unsatisfying performance, one of the main reasons for which is the limited training data. Unfortunately, annotating the objects in the 3D space is extremely time/resource-consuming, which makes it hard to extend the training set arbitrarily. In this work, we focus on the semi-supervised manner and explore the feasibility of a cheaper alternative, i.e. pseudo-labeling, to leverage the unlabeled data. For this purpose, we conduct extensive experiments to investigate whether the pseudo-labels can provide effective supervision for the baseline models under varying settings. The experimental results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the pseudo-labeling mechanism for image-based 3D detection (e.g. under monocular setting, we achieve 20.23 AP for moderate level on the KITTI-3D testing set without bells and whistles, improving the baseline model by 6.03 AP), but also show several interesting and noteworthy findings (e.g. the models trained with pseudo-labels perform better than that trained with ground-truth annotations based on the same training data). We hope this work can provide insights for the image-based 3D detection community under a semi-supervised setting. The codes, pseudo-labels, and pre-trained models will be publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "To simply and effectively realize the trajectory tracking control of a bionic joint actuated by a single pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM), a cascaded control strategy is proposed based on the robust modeling method. Firstly, the relationship between the input voltage of the proportional directional control valve and the inner driving pressure of PAM is expressed as a nonlinear model analytically. Secondly, the nonlinear relationship between the driving pressure input of PAM and the angular position output of the bionic joint is described as a second-order linear time-invariant model (LTI) accompanied by parametric perturbations, equivalently, and then the parameters of the model are identified by the robust modeling method. Then, a hybrid model is established based on the two models (the nonlinear model and the LTI model) and corresponding to it, a cascaded controller is developed, the outer loop of which is an H-infinite controller for the angular position tracking designed by loop-shaping design procedure (LSDP) and the inner loop is a nonlinear controller based on the feedback linearization theory for the PAM driving pressure control. Finally, the experiment is accomplished within the joint rotation range of 90 degrees and with the working frequency upper bound of 1.25 rad/s. And the joint with the developed cascaded controller tracks given reference trajectories with steady-state errors smaller than 2%. Results show that the trajectory tracking control of a highly nonlinear system is highly efficient using the proposed strategy in the case of relatively low work frequency. ",

Results showed a large variability in performance both across teams and across tasks, with promising results notably for Task 1 - EPVS and Task 2 - Microbleeds and not practically useful results yet for Task 3 - Lacunes.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied to many real-world static graphs. However, the success of static graphs has not fully translated to dynamic graphs due to the limitations in model design, evaluation settings, and training strategies. Concretely, existing dynamic GNNs do not incorporate state-of-the-art designs from static GNNs, which limits their performance. Current evaluation settings for dynamic GNNs do not fully reflect the evolving nature of dynamic graphs. Finally, commonly used training methods for dynamic GNNs are not scalable. Here we propose ROLAND, an effective graph representation learning framework for real-world dynamic graphs. At its core, the ROLAND framework can help researchers easily repurpose any static GNN to dynamic graphs. Our insight is to view the node embeddings at different GNN layers as hierarchical node states and then recurrently update them over time. We then introduce a live-update evaluation setting for dynamic graphs that mimics real-world use cases, where GNNs are making predictions and being updated on a rolling basis. Finally, we propose a scalable and efficient training approach for dynamic GNNs via incremental training and meta-learning. We conduct experiments over eight different dynamic graph datasets on future link prediction tasks. Models built using the ROLAND framework achieve on average 62.7% relative mean reciprocal rank (MRR) improvement over state-of-the-art baselines under the standard evaluation settings on three datasets. We find state-of-the-art baselines experience out-of-memory errors for larger datasets, while ROLAND can easily scale to dynamic graphs with 56 million edges. After re-implementing these baselines using the ROLAND training strategy, ROLAND models still achieve on average 15.5% relative MRR improvement over the baselines. ",

Pedestrian accidents contribute a significant amount to the high number of annual traffic casualties, which is why it is crucial for pedestrians to use safety measures such as a crosswalk. However, people often forget to activate a crosswalk light or are unable to do so -- such as those who are visually impaired or have occupied hands. Other pedestrians are simply careless and find the crosswalk signals a hassle, which can result in an accident where a car hits them. In this paper, we consider an improvement to the crosswalk system by designing a system that can detect pedestrians and triggering the crosswalk signal automatically. We collect a dataset of images that we then use to train a convolutional neural network to distinguish between pedestrians (including bicycle riders) and various false alarms. The resulting system can capture and evaluate images in real time, and the result can be used to automatically activate systems a crosswalk light. After extensive testing of our system in real-world environments, we conclude that it is feasible as a back-up system that can compliment existing crosswalk buttons, and thereby improve the overall safety of crossing the street.

To achieve more accurate path prediction, the Transformer architecture is adopted in our model. To better utilize the lane information, the lanes which are in opposite direction to target agent are not likely to be taken by the target agent and are consequently filtered out. In addition, consecutive lane chunks are combined to ensure the lane input to be long enough for path prediction.

Participants in a large behavioral experiment showed increased rates of biased decision-making when part of a social network relative to asocial participants, across 40 independently evolving populations. Drawing on techniques from machine learning and Bayesian statistics, we identify a simple adjustment to content-selection algorithms that is predicted to mitigate bias amplification. This algorithm generates a sample of perspectives from within an individual's network that is more representative of the population as a whole. In a second large experiment, this strategy reduced bias amplification while maintaining the benefits of information sharing. ",

The continuous and differentiable properties of the solution space spanned by the additive Gaussian noise model are used as a heuristic that generates meaningful estimates of layer robustness without the need for combinatorial optimization techniques. Instead, the amount of noise injected into the accurate computations is learned during network training using backpropagation. A probabilistic model of the multiplier error is presented to bridge the gap between the domains; the model estimates the standard deviation of the approximate multiplier error, connecting solutions in the additive Gaussian noise space to actual hardware instances. Our experiments show that the combination of heterogeneous approximation and neural network retraining reduces the energy consumption for multiplications by 70% to 79% for different ResNet variants on the CIFAR-10 dataset with a Top-1 accuracy loss below one percentage point. For the more complex Tiny ImageNet task, our VGG16 model achieves a 53 % reduction in energy consumption with a drop in Top-5 accuracy of 0.5 percentage points. We further demonstrate that our error model can predict the parameters of an approximate multiplier in the context of the commonly used additive Gaussian noise (AGN) model with high accuracy.

    "abstract": "Nearest neighbor-based methods are commonly used for classification tasks and as subroutines of other data-analysis methods. An attacker with the capability of inserting their own data points into the training set can manipulate the inferred nearest neighbor structure. We distill this goal to the task of performing a training-set data insertion attack against $k$-Nearest Neighbor classification ($k$NN). We prove that computing an optimal training-time (a.k.a. poisoning) attack against $k$NN classification is NP-Hard, even when $k = 1$ and the attacker can insert only a single data point. We provide an anytime algorithm to perform such an attack, and a greedy algorithm for general $k$ and attacker budget. We provide theoretical bounds and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our methods on synthetic and real-world datasets. Empirically, we find that $k$NN is vulnerable in practice and that dimensionality reduction is an effective defense. We conclude with a discussion of open problems illuminated by our analysis. ",

In this paper, we first propose an efficient multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) scheme based on deep learning to filter out echoes from all microphone signals at once. Then, we employ a lightweight complex spectral mapping framework (LCSM) for end-to-end SAEC without decorrelation preprocessing to the loudspeaker signals. Inplace convolution and channel-wise spatial modeling are utilized to ensure the near-end signal information is preserved. Finally, a cross-domain loss function is designed for better generalization capability. Experiments are evaluated on a variety of untrained conditions and results demonstrate that the LCSM significantly outperforms previous methods. Moreover, the proposed causal framework only has 0.55 million parameters, much less than the similar deep learning-based methods, which is important for the resource-limited devices. ",

Existing models are mostly based on the technique of inverse propensity score (IPS). However, in the recommendation domain, IPS can be hard to estimate given the sparse and noisy nature of the observed user-item exposure data. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we assume that the user preference can be dominated by a small amount of latent factors, and propose to cluster the users for computing more accurate IPS via increasing the exposure densities. Basically, such method is similar with the spirit of stratification models in applied statistics. However, unlike previous heuristic stratification strategy, we learn the cluster criterion by presenting the users with low ranking embeddings, which are future shared with the user representations in the recommender model. At last, we find that our model has strong connections with the previous two types of debiased recommender models. We conduct extensive experiments based on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

Then, by defining a new cost function, we introduce a framework for weighted training of fall detection models using occluded and un-occluded videos, which can be applied to any learnable fall detection system. Finally, we use both a non-deep and deep model to evaluate the effect of the proposed weighted training method. Experiments show that the proposed method can improve the classification accuracy by 36% for a non-deep model and 55% for a deep model in occlusion conditions.

    "abstract": "Despite the success of AI-enabled onboard perception, on-ramp merging has been one of the main challenges for autonomous driving. Due to limited sensing range of onboard sensors, a merging vehicle can hardly observe main road conditions and merge properly. By leveraging the wireless communications between connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), a merging CAV has potential to proactively obtain the intentions of nearby vehicles. However, CAVs can be prone to inaccurate observations, such as the noisy basic safety messages (BSM) and poor quality surveillance images. In this paper, we present a novel approach for Robust on-ramp merge of CAVs via Augmented and Multi-modal Reinforcement Learning, named by RAMRL. Specifically, we formulate the on-ramp merging problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) by taking driving safety, comfort driving behavior, and traffic efficiency into account. To provide reliable merging maneuvers, we simultaneously leverage BSM and surveillance images for multi-modal observation, which is used to learn a policy model through proximal policy optimization (PPO). Moreover, to improve data efficiency and provide better generalization performance, we train the policy model with augmented data (e.g., noisy BSM and noisy surveillance images). Extensive experiments are conducted with Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) platform under two typical merging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our robust on-ramp merging design. ",

Their extension to signed graphs with positive as well as negative links imposes multiple issues including computational irregularities and ambiguous frequency interpretation, making the design of computationally efficient low pass filters challenging. In this paper, we address these issues via spectral analysis of signed graphs and propose two different signed graph neural networks, one keeps only low-frequency information and one also retains high-frequency information.

    "abstract": "As one of the most pressing challenges of the 21st century, global climate change demands a host of changes across four critical energy infrastructures: the electric grid, the natural gas system, the oil system, and the coal system. Unfortunately, these four systems are often studied individually, and rarely together as integrated systems. Instead, holistic multi-energy system models can serve to improve the understanding of these interdependent systems and guide policies that shape the systems as they evolve into the future. The NSF project entitled \"American Multi-Modal Energy System Synthetic \\& Simulated Data (AMES-3D)\" seeks to fill this void with an open-source, physically-informed, structural and behavioral machine-learning model of the AMES. To that end, this paper uses a GIS-data-driven, model-based system engineering approach to develop structural models of the American Multi-Modal Energy System (AMES). This paper produces and reports the hetero-functional incidence tensor, hetero-functional adjacency matrix, and the formal graph adjacency matrix in terms of their statistics. This work compares these four hetero-functional graph models across the states of New York (NY), California (CA), Texas (TX), and the United States of America (USA) as a whole. From the reported statistics, the paper finds that the geography and the sustainable energy policies of these states are deeply reflected in the structure of their multi-energy infrastructure systems and impact the full USA's structure.

As there are far fewer majority graphs or weighted majority graphs than there are preference profiles (for a bounded number of candidates and voters), computer-aided techniques such as satisfiability solving become practical for proving results about C1 and pairwise methods. In this paper, we develop an approach to generalizing impossibility theorems proved for C1 or pairwise voting methods to impossibility theorems covering all voting methods. We apply this approach to impossibility theorems involving \"variable candidate\" axioms--in particular, social choice versions of Sen's well-known $\\gamma$ and $\\alpha$ axioms for individual choice--which concern what happens when a candidate is added or removed from an election. A key tool is a construction of preference profiles from majority graphs and weighted majority graphs that differs from the classic constructions of McGarvey and Debord, especially in better commutative behavior with respect to other operations on profiles.

To address this, we may wish to learn representations of data that are domain-invariant in the sense that we preserve data structure that is stable across domains, but throw out spuriously-varying parts. There are many representation-learning approaches of this type, including methods based on data augmentation, distributional invariances, and risk invariance. Unfortunately, when faced with any particular real-world domain shift, it is unclear which, if any, of these methods might be expected to work. The purpose of this paper is to show how the different methods relate to each other, and clarify the real-world circumstances under which each is expected to succeed. The key tool is a new notion of domain shift relying on the idea that causal relationships are invariant, but non-causal relationships (e.g., due to confounding) may vary. ",

Recently, an analytical solution for the probability that the GFP holds for an individual in a network with correlated attributes was obtained using the copula method but by assuming a locally tree structure of the underlying network [Jo et al., Physical Review E \\textbf{104}, 054301 (2021)]. Considering the abundant triangles in most social networks, we employ a vine copula method to incorporate the attribute correlation structure between neighbors of a focal individual in addition to the correlation between the focal individual and its neighbors.

Mechanisms have been developed that allow determining the Doppler effects in the cross-section, most of them based on the numerical resolution of the equation known as Solbrig's kernel, which is a cross-section Doppler broadening formalism derived from a free gas atoms distribution hypothesis. This paper explores a novel non-linear approach based on deep learning techniques. Deep neural networks are trained on synthetic and experimental data, serving as an alternative to the cross-section Doppler Broadening (DB). This paper explores the possibility of using physically informed neural networks, where the network is physically regularized to be the solution of a partial derivative equation, inferred from Solbrig's kernel.

To remedy this, we present a novel distillation framework for training a light-weight student model to perform trading volume prediction given historical transaction data. Specifically, we turn the regression model into a probabilistic forecasting model, by training models to predict a Gaussian distribution to which the trading volume belongs. The student model can thus learn from the teacher at a more informative distributional level, by matching its predicted distributions to that of the teacher. Two correlational distillation objectives are further introduced to encourage the student to produce consistent pair-wise relationships with the teacher model. We evaluate the framework on a real-world stock volume dataset with two different time window settings. Experiments demonstrate that our framework is superior to strong baseline models, compressing the model size by $5\\times$ while maintaining $99.6\\%$ prediction accuracy. The extensive analysis further reveals that our framework is more effective than vanilla distillation methods under low-resource scenarios. ",

In this work, we present novel computable error estimators for the estimation of such quantities, which are then used to optimally tune the MLMC hierarchy in a continuation type adaptive algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our adaptive continuation-MLMC in an array of numerical test cases. ",

    "title": "The Efficient Market Hypothesis for Bitcoin in the context of neural  networks",
    "abstract": "This study examines the weak form of the efficient market hypothesis for Bitcoin using a feedforward neural network. Due to the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies in recent years, the question has arisen, as to whether market inefficiencies could be exploited in Bitcoin. Several studies we refer to here discuss this topic in the context of Bitcoin using either statistical tests or machine learning methods, mostly relying exclusively on data from Bitcoin itself. Results regarding market efficiency vary from study to study. In this study, however, the focus is on applying various asset-related input features in a neural network. The aim is to investigate whether the prediction accuracy improves when adding equity stock indices (S&P 500, Russell 2000), currencies (EURUSD), 10 Year US Treasury Note Yield as well as Gold&Silver producers index (XAU), in addition to using Bitcoin returns as input feature. As expected, the results show that more features lead to higher training performance from 54.6% prediction accuracy with one feature to 61% with six features. On the test set, we observe that with our neural network methodology, adding additional asset classes, no increase in prediction accuracy is achieved. One feature set is able to partially outperform a buy-and-hold strategy, but the performance drops again as soon as another feature is added. This leads us to the partial conclusion that weak market inefficiencies for Bitcoin cannot be detected using neural networks and the given asset classes as input. Therefore, based on this study, we find evidence that the Bitcoin market is efficient in the sense of the efficient market hypothesis during the sample period. We encourage further research in this area, as much depends on the sample period chosen, the input features, the model architecture, and the hyperparameters. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a differentiable WORLD synthesizer and demonstrate its use in end-to-end audio style transfer tasks such as (singing) voice conversion and the DDSP timbre transfer task. Accordingly, our baseline differentiable synthesizer has no model parameters, yet it yields adequate synthesis quality. We can extend the baseline synthesizer by appending lightweight black-box postnets which apply further processing to the baseline output in order to improve fidelity. An alternative differentiable approach considers extraction of the source excitation spectrum directly, which can improve naturalness albeit for a narrower class of style transfer applications. The acoustic feature parameterization used by our approaches has the added benefit that it naturally disentangles pitch and timbral information so that they can be modeled separately. Moreover, as there exists a robust means of estimating these acoustic features from monophonic audio sources, it allows for parameter loss terms to be added to an end-to-end objective function, which can help convergence and/or further stabilize (adversarial) training.

    "abstract": "Schematic maps are in daily use to show the connectivity of subway systems and to facilitate travellers to plan their journeys effectively. This study surveys up-to-date algorithmic approaches in order to give an overview of the state of the art in schematic network mapping. The study investigates the hypothesis that the choice of algorithmic approach is often guided by the requirements of the mapping application. For example, an algorithm that computes globally optimal solutions for schematic maps is capable of producing results for printing, while it is not suitable for computing instant layouts due to its long running time. Our analysis and discussion, therefore, focus on the computational complexity of the problem formulation and the running times of the schematic map algorithms, including algorithmic network layout techniques and station labeling techniques. The correlation between problem complexity and running time is then visually depicted using scatter plot diagrams. Moreover, since metro maps are common metaphors for data visualization, we also investigate online tools and application domains using metro map representations for analytics purposes, and finally summarize the potential future opportunities for schematic maps.

    "abstract": "Conventional physics-based modeling is a time-consuming bottleneck in control design for complex nonlinear systems like autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In contrast, purely data-driven models, though convenient and quick to obtain, require a large number of observations and lack operational guarantees for safety-critical systems. Data-driven models leveraging available partially characterized dynamics have potential to provide reliable systems models in a typical data-limited scenario for high value complex systems, thereby avoiding months of expensive expert modeling time. In this work we explore this middle-ground between expert-modeled and pure data-driven modeling. We present control-oriented parametric models with varying levels of domain-awareness that exploit known system structure and prior physics knowledge to create constrained deep neural dynamical system models. We employ universal differential equations to construct data-driven blackbox and graybox representations of the AUV dynamics. In addition, we explore a hybrid formulation that explicitly models the residual error related to imperfect graybox models. We compare the prediction performance of the learned models for different distributions of initial conditions and control inputs to assess their accuracy, generalization, and suitability for control.
