    "abstract": "The numerical modeling of thin shell structures is a challenge, which has been met by a variety of finite element (FE) and other formulations -- many of which give rise to new challenges, from complex implementations to artificial locking. As a potential alternative, we use machine learning and present a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to predict the small-strain response of arbitrarily curved shells. To this end, the shell midsurface is described by a chart, from which the mechanical fields are derived in a curvilinear coordinate frame by adopting Naghdi's shell theory. Unlike in typical PINN applications, the corresponding strong or weak form must therefore be solved in a non-Euclidean domain. We investigate the performance of the proposed PINN in three distinct scenarios, including the well-known Scordelis-Lo roof setting widely used to test FE shell elements against locking. Results show that the PINN can accurately identify the solution field in all three benchmarks if the equations are presented in their weak form, while it may fail to do so when using the strong form. In the thin-thickness limit, where classical methods are susceptible to locking, training time notably increases as the differences in scaling of the membrane, shear, and bending energies lead to adverse numerical stiffness in the gradient flow dynamics. Nevertheless, the PINN can accurately match the ground truth and performs well in the Scordelis-Lo roof benchmark, highlighting its potential for a drastically simplified alternative to designing locking-free shell FE formulations.

    "abstract": "Generating representations that precisely reflect customers' behavior is an important task for providing personalized skill routing experience in Alexa. Currently, Dynamic Routing (DR) team, which is responsible for routing Alexa traffic to providers or skills, relies on two features to be served as personal signals: absolute traffic count and normalized traffic count of every skill usage per customer. Neither of them considers the network based structure for interactions between customers and skills, which contain richer information for customer preferences. In this work, we first build a heterogeneous edge attributed graph based customers' past interactions with the invoked skills, in which the user requests (utterances) are modeled as edges. Then we propose a graph convolutional network(GCN) based model, namely Personalized Dynamic Routing Feature Encoder(PDRFE), that generates personalized customer representations learned from the built graph. Compared with existing models, PDRFE is able to further capture contextual information in the graph convolutional function. The performance of our proposed model is evaluated by a downstream task, defect prediction, that predicts the defect label from the learned embeddings of customers and their triggered skills. We observe up to 41% improvements on the cross entropy metric for our proposed models compared to the baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Research on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) from third-person videos has shown encouraging results on removing the need for manual reward design for robotic tasks. However, most prior works are still limited by training from a relatively restricted domain of videos. In this paper, we argue that the true potential of third-person IRL lies in increasing the diversity of videos for better scaling. To learn a reward function from diverse videos, we propose to perform graph abstraction on the videos followed by temporal matching in the graph space to measure the task progress. Our insight is that a task can be described by entity interactions that form a graph, and this graph abstraction can help remove irrelevant information such as textures, resulting in more robust reward functions. We evaluate our approach, GraphIRL, on cross-embodiment learning in X-MAGICAL and learning from human demonstrations for real-robot manipulation. We show significant improvements in robustness to diverse video demonstrations over previous approaches, and even achieve better results than manual reward design on a real robot pushing task.

Our experiments on VisA and MVTec-AD dataset show that SPD consistently improves these contrastive pre-training baselines and even the supervised pre-training. For example, SPD improves Area Under the Precision-Recall curve (AU-PR) for anomaly segmentation by 5.9% and 6.8% over SimSiam and supervised pre-training respectively in the 2-class high-shot regime.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown as promising solutions for collaborative filtering (CF) with the modeling of user-item interaction graphs. The key idea of existing GNN-based recommender systems is to recursively perform the message passing along the user-item interaction edge for refining the encoded embeddings. Despite their effectiveness, however, most of the current recommendation models rely on sufficient and high-quality training data, such that the learned representations can well capture accurate user preference. User behavior data in many practical recommendation scenarios is often noisy and exhibits skewed distribution, which may result in suboptimal representation performance in GNN-based models. In this paper, we propose SHT, a novel Self-Supervised Hypergraph Transformer framework (SHT) which augments user representations by exploring the global collaborative relationships in an explicit way. Specifically, we first empower the graph neural CF paradigm to maintain global collaborative effects among users and items with a hypergraph transformer network. With the distilled global context, a cross-view generative self-supervised learning component is proposed for data augmentation over the user-item interaction graph, so as to enhance the robustness of recommender systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHT can significantly improve the performance over various state-of-the-art baselines. Further ablation studies show the superior representation ability of our SHT recommendation framework in alleviating the data sparsity and noise issues.

    "abstract": "We share our recent findings in an attempt to train a universal segmentation network for various cell types and imaging modalities. Our method was built on the generalized U-Net architecture, which allows the evaluation of each component individually. We modified the traditional binary training targets to include three classes for direct instance segmentation. Detailed experiments were performed regarding training schemes, training settings, network backbones, and individual modules on the segmentation performance. Our proposed training scheme draws minibatches in turn from each dataset, and the gradients are accumulated before an optimization step. We found that the key to training a universal network is all-time supervision on all datasets, and it is necessary to sample each dataset in an unbiased way. Our experiments also suggest that there might exist common features to define cell boundaries across cell types and imaging modalities, which could allow application of trained models to totally unseen datasets. A few training tricks can further boost the segmentation performance, including uneven class weights in the cross-entropy loss function, well-designed learning rate scheduler, larger image crops for contextual information, and additional loss terms for unbalanced classes. We also found that segmentation performance can benefit from group normalization layer and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling module, thanks to their more reliable statistics estimation and improved semantic understanding, respectively. We participated in the 6th Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC) held at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2021 using one of the developed variants. Our method was evaluated as the best runner up during the initial submission for the primary track, and also secured the 3rd place in an additional round of competition in preparation for the summary publication.

Algorithmically, one of the most important and opaque relationships is that between a problem's structure and an effective solution method. Here, we quantitatively connect the structure of a planning problem to the performance of a given sampling-based motion planning (SBMP) algorithm. We demonstrate that the geometric relationships of motion planning problems can be well captured by graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict SBMP runtime. By using an algorithm portfolio we show that GNN predictions of runtime on particular problems can be leveraged to accelerate online motion planning in both navigation and manipulation tasks. Moreover, the problem-to-runtime map can be inverted to identify subproblems easier to solve by particular SBMPs. We provide a motivating example of how this knowledge may be used to improve integrated task and motion planning on simulated examples. These successes rely on the relational structure of GNNs to capture scalable generalization from low-dimensional navigation tasks to high degree-of-freedom manipulation tasks in 3d environments. ",

To make the generated images manipulatable, we further introduce a latent space alignment module to learn the alignment between StyleGAN2 latent codes and the corresponding textual caption features. When we do online paired data augmentation, we first generate augmented text through random token replacement, then pass the augmented text into the latent space alignment module to output the latent codes, which are finally fed to StyleGAN2 to generate the augmented images.

Though there are various spectral-type subspace clustering algorithms have been proposed, some defects still exist in the reconstruction coefficient matrices constructed by these algorithms. We find that a normalized membership matrix naturally satisfies the above two conditions. Therefore, in this paper, we devise an idempotent representation (IDR) algorithm to pursue reconstruction coefficient matrices approximating normalized membership matrices. IDR designs a new idempotent constraint for reconstruction coefficient matrices. And by combining the doubly stochastic constraints, the coefficient matrices which are closed to normalized membership matrices could be directly achieved. We present the optimization algorithm for solving IDR problem and analyze its computation burden as well as convergence. The comparisons between IDR and related algorithms show the superiority of IDR. Plentiful experiments conducted on both synthetic and real world datasets prove that IDR is an effective and efficient subspace clustering algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "The success of neural fields for 3D vision tasks is now indisputable. Following this trend, several methods aiming for visual localization (e.g., SLAM) have been proposed to estimate distance or density fields using neural fields. However, it is difficult to achieve high localization performance by only density fields-based methods such as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) since they do not provide density gradient in most empty regions. On the other hand, distance field-based methods such as Neural Implicit Surface (NeuS) have limitations in objects' surface shapes. This paper proposes Neural Density-Distance Field (NeDDF), a novel 3D representation that reciprocally constrains the distance and density fields. We extend distance field formulation to shapes with no explicit boundary surface, such as fur or smoke, which enable explicit conversion from distance field to density field. Consistent distance and density fields realized by explicit conversion enable both robustness to initial values and high-quality registration. Furthermore, the consistency between fields allows fast convergence from sparse point clouds. Experiments show that NeDDF can achieve high localization performance while providing comparable results to NeRF on novel view synthesis. The code is available at https://github.com/ueda0319/neddf.

As evident by recent studies, social media has the potential to complement mental health screening on a greater scale. The vast amount of first-person narrative posts in chronological order can provide insights into one's thoughts, feelings, behavior, or mood for some time, enabling a better understanding of depression symptoms reflected in the online space. In this paper, we propose SERCNN, which improves the user representation by (1) stacking two pretrained embeddings from different domains and (2) reintroducing the embedding context to the MLP classifier. Our SERCNN shows great performance over state-of-the-art and other baselines, achieving 93.7% accuracy in a 5-fold cross-validation setting. Since not all users share the same level of online activity, we introduced the concept of a fixed observation window that quantifies the observation period in a predefined number of posts. With as minimal as 10 posts per user, SERCNN performed exceptionally well with an 87% accuracy, which is on par with the BERT model, while having 98% less in the number of parameters. Our findings open up a promising direction for detecting depression on social media with a smaller number of posts for inference, towards creating solutions for a cost-effective and timely intervention.

However, IoT devices were not built with security in mind, which might lead to security vulnerabilities in a multi-device system. Traditionally, we investigated IoT issues by polling IoT developers and specialists. This technique, however, is not scalable since surveying all IoT developers is not feasible. Another way to look into IoT issues is to look at IoT developer discussions on major online development forums like Stack Overflow (SO). However, finding discussions that are relevant to IoT issues is challenging since they are frequently not categorized with IoT-related terms. In this paper, we present the \"IoT Security Dataset\", a domain-specific dataset of 7147 samples focused solely on IoT security discussions. As there are no automated tools to label these samples, we manually labeled them. We further employed multiple transformer models to automatically detect security discussions. Through rigorous investigations, we found that IoT security discussions are different and more complex than traditional security discussions. We demonstrated a considerable performance loss (up to 44%) of transformer models on cross-domain datasets when we transferred knowledge from a general-purpose dataset \"Opiner\", supporting our claim. Thus, we built a domain-specific IoT security detector with an F1-Score of 0.69. We have made the dataset public in the hope that developers would learn more about the security discussion and vendors would enhance their concerns about product security. ",

    "abstract": "ASR has been shown to achieve great performance recently. However, most of them rely on massive paired data, which is not feasible for low-resource languages worldwide. This paper investigates how to learn directly from unpaired phone sequences and speech utterances. We design a two-stage iterative framework. GAN training is adopted in the first stage to find the mapping relationship between unpaired speech and phone sequence. In the second stage, another HMM model is introduced to train from the generator's output, which boosts the performance and provides a better segmentation for the next iteration. In the experiment, we first investigate different choices of model designs. Then we compare the framework to different types of baselines: (i) supervised methods (ii) acoustic unit discovery based methods (iii) methods learning from unpaired data. Our framework performs consistently better than all acoustic unit discovery methods and previous methods learning from unpaired data based on the TIMIT dataset. ",

Different from all the existing works where IRS has already been deployed at a fixed location, we take the location of IRS as a variable to maximize the secrecy rate (SR) under the outage probability constraint by jointly optimizing the location of IRS, transmit beamformer and IRS phase shifts with imperfect channel state information (CSI) of Eve, where we consider two cases: a) the location of Eve is known; b) only a suspicious area of Eve is available. We show a critical observation that CSI models are different before and after IRS deployment, thus the optimization problem could be decomposed and solved via a two-stage framework. For case a), in the first stage, universal upper bounds of outage probabilities only related to the location of IRS are derived which can be optimized via successive convex approximation (SCA) method. In the second stage, we develop an alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to optimize beamformer and phase shifts iteratively. For case b), we propose a Max-Min SR scheme based on two-stage framework, where the location of IRS is optimized based on the worst location of Eve. Simulation results indicate the importance of the location of IRS optimization. ",

Using this representation, we show that after removing the well-known parameter redundancies of the ReLU DNN, which are caused by the positive scaling property, all remaining parameters are independent. Moreover, we show that the ReLU DNN with one, two or three hidden layers can represent CPL spline functions with $K$ arbitrarily prescribed knots (breakpoints), where $K$ is the number of real parameters determining the normalized ReLU DNN (up to the output layer parameters).

While the application to categorical data is straightforward, its usability in the context of images has been limited. Contrary to categorical data the meaning of an image is inherent in the spatial correlation of neighboring pixels making the simple application of noise infeasible. Invertible Neural Networks (INN) have shown excellent generative performance while still providing the ability to quantify the exact likelihood. Their principle is based on transforming a complicated distribution into a simple one e.g. an image into a spherical Gaussian. We hypothesize that adding noise to the latent space of an INN can enable differentially private image modification. Manipulation of the latent space leads to a modified image while preserving important details. Further, by conditioning the INN on meta-data provided with the dataset we aim at leaving dimensions important for downstream tasks like classification untouched while altering other parts that potentially contain identifying information. We term our method content-aware differential privacy (CADP). We conduct experiments on publicly available benchmarking datasets as well as dedicated medical ones. In addition, we show the generalizability of our method to categorical data. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/Cardio-AI/CADP. ",

In pulse compression radar (PCR), discovering phase codes with low aperiodic autocorrelations is essential for a good estimation performance.

In this paper, we put forth a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to discover new phase codes for PCR with the mismatched filter (MMF) receiver. The developed GA, dubbed GASeq, discovers better phase codes than the state of the art. At a code length of 59, the sequence discovered by GASeq achieves a signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) of 50.84, while the best-known sequence has an SCR of 45.16. In addition, the efficiency and scalability of GASeq enable us to search phase codes with a longer code length, which thwarts existing deep learning-based approaches.

Beyond formal approaches, various attempts have been made to estimate the termination behavior of programs using neural networks. However, the majority of these approaches continue to rely on formal methods to provide strong soundness guarantees and consequently suffer from similar limitations. In this paper, we move away from formal methods and embrace the stochastic nature of machine learning models. Instead of aiming for rigorous guarantees that can be interpreted by solvers, our objective is to provide an estimation of a program's termination behavior and of the likely reason for nontermination (when applicable) that a programmer can use for debugging purposes. Compared to previous approaches using neural networks for program termination, we also take advantage of the graph representation of programs by employing Graph Neural Networks. To further assist programmers in understanding and debugging nontermination bugs, we adapt the notions of attention and semantic segmentation, previously used for other application domains, to programs. Overall, we designed and implemented classifiers for program termination based on Graph Convolutional Networks and Graph Attention Networks, as well as a semantic segmentation Graph Neural Network that localizes AST nodes likely to cause nontermination. We also illustrated how the information provided by semantic segmentation can be combined with program slicing to further aid debugging. ",

Richer and more meaningful gradients updates are key to allow self-supervised methods to learn better and in a more efficient manner. In a typical self-distillation framework, the representation of two augmented images are enforced to be coherent at the global level. Nonetheless, incorporating local cues in the proxy task can be beneficial and improve the model accuracy on downstream tasks. This leads to a dual objective in which, on the one hand, coherence between global-representations is enforced and on the other, coherence between local-representations is enforced. Unfortunately, an exact correspondence mapping between two sets of local-representations does not exist making the task of matching local-representations from one augmentation to another non-trivial. We propose to leverage the spatial information in the input images to obtain geometric matchings and compare this geometric approach against previous methods based on similarity matchings. Our study shows that not only 1) geometric matchings perform better than similarity based matchings in low-data regimes but also 2) that similarity based matchings are highly hurtful in low-data regimes compared to the vanilla baseline without local self-distillation.

However, training GNNs on large scale graphs with hundreds of millions nodes is both resource and time consuming.

To address this problem, we present BiFeat: a graph feature quantization methodology to accelerate GNN training by significantly reducing the memory footprint and PCIe bandwidth requirement so that GNNs can take full advantage of GPU computing capabilities. Our key insight is that unlike DNN, GNN is less prone to the information loss of input features caused by quantization. We identify the main accuracy impact factors in graph feature quantization and theoretically prove that BiFeat training converges to a network where the loss is within $\\epsilon$ of the optimal loss of uncompressed network. We perform extensive evaluation of BiFeat using several popular GNN models and datasets, including GraphSAGE on MAG240M, the largest public graph dataset. The results demonstrate that BiFeat achieves a compression ratio of more than 30 and improves GNN training speed by 200%-320% with marginal accuracy loss. In particular, BiFeat achieves a record by training GraphSAGE on MAG240M within one hour using only four GPUs. ",

We allow our system to model more complex relations between the two by assessing more expressive scoring functions. Across a wide range of baseline and established systems this results in consistent improvements of around 6 points in AUC. Our results also indicate a trade-off between the complexity of news encoder and scoring function: A fairly simple baseline model scores well above 68% AUC on the MIND dataset and comes within 2 points of the published state-of-the-art, while requiring a fraction of the computational costs.

    "abstract": "In this work, we propose a fully differentiable graph neural network (GNN)-based architecture for channel decoding and showcase competitive decoding performance for various coding schemes, such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) and BCH codes. The idea is to let a neural network (NN) learn a generalized message passing algorithm over a given graph that represents the forward error correction (FEC) code structure by replacing node and edge message updates with trainable functions. Contrary to many other deep learning-based decoding approaches, the proposed solution enjoys scalability to arbitrary block lengths and the training is not limited by the curse of dimensionality. We benchmark our proposed decoder against state-of-the-art in conventional channel decoding as well as against recent deep learning-based results. For the (63,45) BCH code, our solution outperforms weighted belief propagation (BP) decoding by approximately 0.4 dB with significantly less decoding iterations and even for 5G NR LDPC codes, we observe a competitive performance when compared to conventional BP decoding. For the BCH codes, the resulting GNN decoder can be fully parametrized with only 9640 weights. ",

We then improve the accuracy of the identified force magnitude by compensating for model inaccuracies, unmodeled loads, and any other potential source of quasi-static disturbances acting on the robot.

To serve these use cases cost-effectively, network slicing plays a key role in dynamically creating virtual end-to-end networks according to specific resource demands. A network slice may have hundreds of configurable parameters over multiple technical domains that define the performance of the network slice, which makes it impossible to use traditional model-based solutions to orchestrate resources for network slices. In this article, we discuss how to design and deploy deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a model-free approach, to address the network slicing problem. First, we analyze the network slicing problem and present a standard-compliant system architecture that enables DRL-based solutions in 5G and beyond networks. Second, we provide an in-depth analysis of the challenges in designing and deploying DRL in network slicing systems. Third, we explore multiple promising techniques, i.e., safety and distributed DRL, and imitation learning, for automating end-to-end network slicing. ",

Prior approaches have relied on evolutionary search (ES) methods capable of generating diverse levels, but this generation procedure is slow, which is problematic in real-time settings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has also been proposed to tackle the same problem, and while level generation is fast, training time can be prohibitively expensive. We propose a framework to tackle the procedural content generation problem that combines the best of ES and RL. In particular, our approach first uses ES to generate a sequence of levels evolved over time, and then uses behaviour cloning to distil these levels into a policy, which can then be queried to produce new levels quickly. We apply our approach to a maze game and Super Mario Bros, with our results indicating that our approach does in fact decrease the time required for level generation, especially when an increasing number of valid levels are required.

However, SOTA works are limited in terms of the topology it can effectively describe, distortion it introduces to reconstruct complex surfaces and model efficiency. In this work, we present Minimal Neural Atlas, a novel atlas-based explicit neural surface representation. At its core is a fully learnable parametric domain, given by an implicit probabilistic occupancy field defined on an open square of the parametric space. In contrast, prior works generally predefine the parametric domain. The added flexibility enables charts to admit arbitrary topology and boundary. Thus, our representation can learn a minimal atlas of 3 charts with distortion-minimal parameterization for surfaces of arbitrary topology, including closed and open surfaces with arbitrary connected components. Our experiments support the hypotheses and show that our reconstructions are more accurate in terms of the overall geometry, due to the separation of concerns on topology and geometry. ",

Despite its tremendous empirical successes, the understanding of contrastive learning for RL remains elusive. To narrow such a gap, we study how RL can be empowered by contrastive learning in a class of Markov decision processes (MDPs) and Markov games (MGs) with low-rank transitions. For both models, we propose to extract the correct feature representations of the low-rank model by minimizing a contrastive loss. Moreover, under the online setting, we propose novel upper confidence bound (UCB)-type algorithms that incorporate such a contrastive loss with online RL algorithms for MDPs or MGs. We further theoretically prove that our algorithm recovers the true representations and simultaneously achieves sample efficiency in learning the optimal policy and Nash equilibrium in MDPs and MGs. We also provide empirical studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the UCB-based contrastive learning method for RL. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first provably efficient online RL algorithm that incorporates contrastive learning for representation learning.

This approach was not yet developed in Contrast Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM) where access to large databases is complex. This work proposes a deep-learning-based Computer Aided Diagnostic development for CESM recombined images able to detect lesions and classify cases. Material \\& methods: A large CESM diagnostic dataset with biopsy-proven lesions was collected from various hospitals and different acquisition systems. The annotated data were split on a patient level for the training (55%), validation (15%) and test (30%) of a deep neural network with a state-of-the-art detection architecture. Free Receiver Operating Characteristic (FROC) was used to evaluate the model for the detection of 1) all lesions, 2) biopsied lesions and 3) malignant lesions. ROC curve was used to evaluate breast cancer classification. The metrics were finally compared to clinical results. Results: For the evaluation of the malignant lesion detection, at high sensitivity (Se>0.95), the false positive rate was at 0.61 per image. For the classification of malignant cases, the model reached an Area Under the Curve (AUC) in the range of clinical CESM diagnostic results. Conclusion: This CAD is the first development of a lesion detection and classification model for CESM images. Trained on a large dataset, it has the potential to be used for helping the management of biopsy decision and for helping the radiologist detecting complex lesions that could modify the clinical treatment.

    "abstract": "Optical imaging is commonly used for both scientific and technological applications across industry and academia. In image sensing, a measurement, such as of an object's position, is performed by computational analysis of a digitized image. An emerging image-sensing paradigm breaks this delineation between data collection and analysis by designing optical components to perform not imaging, but encoding. By optically encoding images into a compressed, low-dimensional latent space suitable for efficient post-analysis, these image sensors can operate with fewer pixels and fewer photons, allowing higher-throughput, lower-latency operation. Optical neural networks (ONNs) offer a platform for processing data in the analog, optical domain. ONN-based sensors have however been limited to linear processing, but nonlinearity is a prerequisite for depth, and multilayer NNs significantly outperform shallow NNs on many tasks. Here, we realize a multilayer ONN pre-processor for image sensing, using a commercial image intensifier as a parallel optoelectronic, optical-to-optical nonlinear activation function. We demonstrate that the nonlinear ONN pre-processor can achieve compression ratios of up to 800:1 while still enabling high accuracy across several representative computer-vision tasks, including machine-vision benchmarks, flow-cytometry image classification, and identification of objects in real scenes. In all cases we find that the ONN's nonlinearity and depth allowed it to outperform a purely linear ONN encoder. Although our experiments are specialized to ONN sensors for incoherent-light images, alternative ONN platforms should facilitate a range of ONN sensors. These ONN sensors may surpass conventional sensors by pre-processing optical information in spatial, temporal, and/or spectral dimensions, potentially with coherent and quantum qualities, all natively in the optical domain.

This problem has been extensively studied in classical computer science and has vivid importance to modern applications like coordinating a fleet of drones in an enemy's territory. Quantum non-locality, like Bell inequality violation, has shown that in many cases quantum entanglement allows for improved coordination of two separated parties compared to classical sources. The non-signaling correlations in many cases even strengthened such phenomena. In this work, we analyze, how Bell non-locality can be used by asymmetric location-aware agents trying to rendezvous on a finite network with a limited number of steps. We provide the optimal solution to this problem for both agents using quantum resources, and agents with only ``classical'' computing power. Our results show that for cubic graphs and cycles it is possible to gain an advantage by allowing the agents to use assistance of entangled quantum states. ",

    "abstract": "The fusion of multispectral and panchromatic images is always dubbed pansharpening. Most of the available deep learning-based pan-sharpening methods sharpen the multispectral images through a one-step scheme, which strongly depends on the reconstruction ability of the network. However, remote sensing images always have large variations, as a result, these one-step methods are vulnerable to the error accumulation and thus incapable of preserving spatial details as well as the spectral information. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step model for pan-sharpening that sharpens the MS image through the progressive compensation of the spatial and spectral information. Firstly, a deep multiscale guided generative adversarial network is used to preliminarily enhance the spatial resolution of the MS image. Starting from the pre-sharpened MS image in the coarse domain, our approach then progressively refines the spatial and spectral residuals over a couple of generative adversarial networks (GANs) that have reverse architectures. The whole model is composed of triple GANs, and based on the specific architecture, a joint compensation loss function is designed to enable the triple GANs to be trained simultaneously. Moreover, the spatial-spectral residual compensation structure proposed in this paper can be extended to other pan-sharpening methods to further enhance their fusion results. Extensive experiments are performed on different datasets and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "Suppose that $K_n$ is the complete graph on vertex set $[n]$, and $\\D$ is a distribution on subsets of its edges. The $\\mathcal{D}$-adaptive random graph process (or $\\mathcal{D}$-process) is a single player game in which the player is initially presented the empty graph on $[n]$. In each step, a subset of edges of $K_n$, say $X$, is independently sampled from $\\mathcal{D}$ and presented to the player. The player then adaptively selects precisely one edge $e$ from $X$, and adds $e$ to its current graph. For a fixed (edge) monotone graph property, the objective of the player is to force the graph to satisfy the property in as few steps as possible. Through appropriate choices of $\\mathcal{D}$, the $\\mathcal{D}$-process generalizes well-studied adaptive processes, such as the Achlioptas process and the semi-random graph process. We prove a theorem which gives a sufficient condition for the existence of a sharp threshold for the property $\\mathcal{P}$ in the $\\mathcal{D}$-process. We apply our theorem to the semi-random graph process and prove the existence of a sharp threshold when $\\mathcal{P}$ corresponds to being Hamiltonian or to containing a perfect matching. These are the first results for the semi-random graph process which show the existence of a sharp threshold when $\\mathcal{P}$ corresponds to containing a \\textit{sparse} spanning graph. Using a separate analytic argument, we show that each sharp threshold is of the form $C_{\\mathcal{P}}n$ for some fixed constant $C_{\\mathcal{P}}>0$. This answers two of the open problems proposed by Ben-Eliezer et al. (SODA 2020) in the affirmative. Unlike similar results which establish sharp thresholds for certain distributions and properties, we establish the existence of sharp thresholds without explicitly identifying asymptotically optimal strategies.

We recorded the EEG activity of 24 participants while they were performing a 3D-MOT task with either 1, 2 or 3 targets where some trials were lateralized and some were not. We observed what seems to be a handoff between focused attention and working memory processes when going from tracking to recall. Our findings revealed a strong inhibition in delta and theta frequencies from the frontal region during tracking, followed by a strong (re)activation of these same frequencies during recall. Our results also showed contralateral delay activity (CDA) for the lateralized trials, in both the identification and recall phases but not during tracking. ",

    "abstract": "Large graphs commonly appear in social networks, knowledge graphs, recommender systems, life sciences, and decision making problems. Summarizing large graphs by their high level properties is helpful in solving problems in these settings. In spectral clustering, we aim to identify clusters of nodes where most edges fall within clusters and only few edges fall between clusters. This task is important for many downstream applications and exploratory analysis. A core step of spectral clustering is performing an eigendecomposition of the corresponding graph Laplacian matrix (or equivalently, a singular value decomposition, SVD, of the incidence matrix). The convergence of iterative singular value decomposition approaches depends on the eigengaps of the spectrum of the given matrix, i.e., the difference between consecutive eigenvalues. For a graph Laplacian corresponding to a well-clustered graph, the eigenvalues will be non-negative but very small (much less than $1$) slowing convergence. This paper introduces a parallelizable approach to dilating the spectrum in order to accelerate SVD solvers and in turn, spectral clustering. This is accomplished via polynomial approximations to matrix operations that favorably transform the spectrum of a matrix without changing its eigenvectors. Experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly accelerates convergence, and we explain how this transformation can be parallelized and stochastically approximated to scale with available compute.

Traditionally, such models have been constructed with explicit representations such as meshes and voxel masks, or implicit representations such as radial basis functions or atomic (tubular) shapes. Here, we propose to represent surfaces by the zero level set of their signed distance function (SDF) in a differentiable implicit neural representation (INR). This allows us to model complex vascular structures with a representation that is implicit, continuous, light-weight, and easy to integrate with deep learning algorithms. We here demonstrate the potential of this approach with three practical examples. First, we obtain an accurate and watertight surface for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) from CT images and show robust fitting from as little as 200 points on the surface. Second, we simultaneously fit nested vessel walls in a single INR without intersections. Third, we show how 3D models of individual arteries can be smoothly blended into a single watertight surface. Our results show that INRs are a flexible representation with potential for minimally interactive annotation and manipulation of complex vascular structures. ",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To create and evaluate the accuracy of an artificial intelligence Deep learning platform (ORAiCLE) capable of using only retinal fundus images to predict both an individuals overall 5 year cardiovascular risk (CVD) and the relative contribution of the component risk factors that comprise this risk. Methods: We used 165,907 retinal images from a database of 47,236 patient visits. Initially, each image was paired with biometric data age, ethnicity, sex, presence and duration of diabetes a HDL/LDL ratios as well as any CVD event wtihin 5 years of the retinal image acquisition. A risk score based on Framingham equations was calculated. The real CVD event rate was also determined for the individuals and overall population. Finally, ORAiCLE was trained using only age, ethnicity, sex plus retinal images. Results: Compared to Framingham-based score, ORAiCLE was up to 12% more accurate in prediciting cardiovascular event in he next 5-years, especially for the highest risk group of people. The reliability and accuracy of each of the restrictive models was suboptimal to ORAiCLE performance ,indicating that it was using data from both sets of data to derive its final results. Conclusion: Retinal photography is inexpensive and only minimal training is required to acquire them as fully automated, inexpensive camera systems are now widely available. As such, AI-based CVD risk algorithms such as ORAiCLE promise to make CV health screening more accurate, more afforadable and more accessible for all. Furthermore, ORAiCLE unique ability to assess the relative contribution of the components that comprise an individuals overall risk would inform treatment decisions based on the specific needs of an individual, thereby increasing the likelihood of positive health outcomes.

    "title": "Robust Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping via Approximate Message  Passing",
    "abstract": "Purpose: It has been challenging to recover QSM in the presence of phase errors, which could be caused by the noise or strong local susceptibility shifts in cases of brain hemorrhage and calcification. We propose a Bayesian formulation for QSM where a two-component Gaussian-mixture distribution is used to model the long-tailed noise (error) distribution, and design an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm with automatic and adaptive parameter estimation. Theory: Wavelet coefficients of the susceptibility map follow the Laplace distribution. The measurement noise follows a two-component Gaussian-mixture distribution where the second Gaussian component models the noise outliers. The distribution parameters are treated as unknown variables and jointly recovered with the susceptibility using AMP. Methods: The proposed AMP with parameter estimation (AMP-PE) is compared with the state-of-the-art nonlinear L1-QSM and MEDI approaches that adopt the L1-norm and L2-norm data-fidelity terms respectively. The three approaches are tested on the Sim2Snr1 data from QSM challenge 2.0, the in vivo data from both healthy and hemorrhage scans. Results: On the simulated Sim2Snr1 dataset, AMP-PE achieved the lowest NRMSE and SSIM, MEDI achieved the lowest HFEN, and each approach also has its own strong suit when it comes to various local evaluation metrics. On the in vivo dataset, AMP-PE is better at preserving structural details and removing streaking artifacts than L1-QSM and MEDI. Conclusion: By leveraging a customized Gaussian-mixture noise prior, AMP-PE achieves better performance on the challenging QSM cases involving hemorrhage and calcification. It is equipped with built-in parameter estimation, which avoids subjective bias from the usual visual fine-tuning step of in vivo reconstruction. ",
