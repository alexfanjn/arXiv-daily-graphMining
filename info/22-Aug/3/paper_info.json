    "abstract": "Creating artificial social intelligence - algorithms that can understand the nuances of multi-person interactions - is an exciting and emerging challenge in processing facial expressions and gestures from multimodal videos. Recent multimodal methods have set the state of the art on many tasks, but have difficulty modeling the complex face-to-face conversational dynamics across speaking turns in social interaction, particularly in a self-supervised setup. In this paper, we propose Face-to-Face Contrastive Learning (F2F-CL), a graph neural network designed to model social interactions using factorization nodes to contextualize the multimodal face-to-face interaction along the boundaries of the speaking turn. With the F2F-CL model, we propose to perform contrastive learning between the factorization nodes of different speaking turns within the same video. We experimentally evaluated the challenging Social-IQ dataset and show state-of-the-art results. ",

    "abstract": "Interestingness recognition is crucial for decision making in autonomous exploration for mobile robots. Previous methods proposed an unsupervised online learning approach that can adapt to environments and detect interesting scenes quickly, but lack the ability to adapt to human-informed interesting objects. To solve this problem, we introduce a human-interactive framework, AirInteraction, that can detect human-informed objects via few-shot online learning. To reduce the communication bandwidth, we first apply an online unsupervised learning algorithm on the unmanned vehicle for interestingness recognition and then only send the potential interesting scenes to a base-station for human inspection. The human operator is able to draw and provide bounding box annotations for particular interesting objects, which are sent back to the robot to detect similar objects via few-shot learning. Only using few human-labeled examples, the robot can learn novel interesting object categories during the mission and detect interesting scenes that contain the objects. We evaluate our method on various interesting scene recognition datasets. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first human-informed few-shot object detection framework for autonomous exploration.

    "abstract": "Flaky tests cause significant problems as they can interrupt automated build processes that rely on all tests succeeding and undermine the trustworthiness of tests. Numerous causes of test flakiness have been identified, and program analyses exist to detect such tests. Typically, these methods produce advice to developers on how to refactor tests in order to make test outcomes deterministic. We argue that one source of flakiness is the lack of assumptions that precisely describe under which circumstances a test is meaningful. We devise a sanitisation technique that can isolate f laky tests quickly by inferring such assumptions on-the-fly, allowing automated builds to proceed as flaky tests are ignored. We demonstrate this approach for Java and Groovy programs by implementing it as extensions for three popular testing frameworks (JUnit4, JUnit5 and Spock) that can transparently inject the inferred assumptions. If JUnit5 is used, those extensions can be deployed without refactoring project source code. We demonstrate and evaluate the utility of our approach using a set of six popular real-world programs, addressing known test flakiness issues in these programs caused by dependencies of tests on network availability. We find that our method effectively sanitises failures induced by network connectivity problems with high precision and recall. ",

    "abstract": "Recent Deep Learning (DL) advancements in solving complex real-world tasks have led to its widespread adoption in practical applications. However, this opportunity comes with significant underlying risks, as many of these models rely on privacy-sensitive data for training in a variety of applications, making them an overly-exposed threat surface for privacy violations. Furthermore, the widespread use of cloud-based Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) for its robust infrastructure support has broadened the threat surface to include a variety of remote side-channel attacks. In this paper, we first identify and report a novel data-dependent timing side-channel leakage (termed Class Leakage) in DL implementations originating from non-constant time branching operation in a widely used DL framework PyTorch. We further demonstrate a practical inference-time attack where an adversary with user privilege and hard-label black-box access to an MLaaS can exploit Class Leakage to compromise the privacy of MLaaS users. DL models are vulnerable to Membership Inference Attack (MIA), where an adversary's objective is to deduce whether any particular data has been used while training the model. In this paper, as a separate case study, we demonstrate that a DL model secured with differential privacy (a popular countermeasure against MIA) is still vulnerable to MIA against an adversary exploiting Class Leakage. We develop an easy-to-implement countermeasure by making a constant-time branching operation that alleviates the Class Leakage and also aids in mitigating MIA. We have chosen two standard benchmarking image classification datasets, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 to train five state-of-the-art pre-trained DL models, over two different computing environments having Intel Xeon and Intel i7 processors to validate our approach.

    "abstract": "Training deep neural networks is a very demanding task, especially challenging is how to adapt architectures to improve the performance of trained models. We can find that sometimes, shallow networks generalize better than deep networks, and the addition of more layers results in higher training and test errors. The deep residual learning framework addresses this degradation problem by adding skip connections to several neural network layers. It would at first seem counter-intuitive that such skip connections are needed to train deep networks successfully as the expressivity of a network would grow exponentially with depth. In this paper, we first analyze the flow of information through neural networks. We introduce and evaluate the batch-entropy which quantifies the flow of information through each layer of a neural network. We prove empirically and theoretically that a positive batch-entropy is required for gradient descent-based training approaches to optimize a given loss function successfully. Based on those insights, we introduce batch-entropy regularization to enable gradient descent-based training algorithms to optimize the flow of information through each hidden layer individually. With batch-entropy regularization, gradient descent optimizers can transform untrainable networks into trainable networks. We show empirically that we can therefore train a \"vanilla\" fully connected network and convolutional neural network -- no skip connections, batch normalization, dropout, or any other architectural tweak -- with 500 layers by simply adding the batch-entropy regularization term to the loss function. The effect of batch-entropy regularization is not only evaluated on vanilla neural networks, but also on residual networks, autoencoders, and also transformer models over a wide range of computer vision as well as natural language processing tasks.

GLIDE is a generative neural network that can synthesize (inpaint) masked areas of an image, conditioned on a short piece of text. Our idea is to mask-out a region of the input image where the effect of the action is expected to occur. GLIDE is then used to inpaint the masked region conditioned on the required action. In this way, the resulting image has the same background context as the input image, updated to show the effect of the action. We give qualitative results from experiments using the EPIC dataset of ego-centric videos labelled with actions. ",

The implementation of the framework is based on the LLVM compiler toolchain combined with the UCX communication framework. The framework can generate binary machine code or LLVM bitcode for multiple CPU architectures and move the code to remote machines while dynamically optimizing and linking the code on the target platform. The remotely injected code can recursively propagate itself to other remote machines or generate new code. The goal of this paper is threefold: (a) to present an architecture and implementation of the framework that provides essential infrastructure to program a new class of disaggregated systems wherein heterogeneous programming elements such as compute nodes and data processing units (DPUs) are distributed across the system, (b) to demonstrate how the framework can be integrated with modern, high-level programming languages such as Julia, and (c) to demonstrate and evaluate a new class of eXtended Remote Direct Memory Access (X-RDMA) communication operations that are enabled by this framework. To evaluate the capabilities of the framework, we used a cluster with Fujitsu CPUs and heterogeneous cluster with Intel CPUs and BlueField-2 DPUs interconnected using high-performance RDMA fabric. We demonstrated an X-RDMA pointer chase application that outperforms an RDMA GET-based implementation by 70% and is as fast as Active Messages, but does not require function predeployment on remote platforms.

    "abstract": "Movement synchrony reflects the coordination of body movements between interacting dyads. The estimation of movement synchrony has been automated by powerful deep learning models such as transformer networks. However, instead of designing a specialized network for movement synchrony estimation, previous transformer-based works broadly adopted architectures from other tasks such as human activity recognition. Therefore, this paper proposed a skeleton-based graph transformer for movement synchrony estimation. The proposed model applied ST-GCN, a spatial-temporal graph convolutional neural network for skeleton feature extraction, followed by a spatial transformer for spatial feature generation. The spatial transformer is guided by a uniquely designed joint position embedding shared between the same joints of interacting individuals. Besides, we incorporated a temporal similarity matrix in temporal attention computation considering the periodic intrinsic of body movements. In addition, the confidence score associated with each joint reflects the uncertainty of a pose, while previous works on movement synchrony estimation have not sufficiently emphasized this point. Since transformer networks demand a significant amount of data to train, we constructed a dataset for movement synchrony estimation using Human3.6M, a benchmark dataset for human activity recognition, and pretrained our model on it using contrastive learning. We further applied knowledge distillation to alleviate information loss introduced by pose detector failure in a privacy-preserving way. We compared our method with representative approaches on PT13, a dataset collected from autism therapy interventions. Our method achieved an overall accuracy of 88.98% and surpassed its counterparts by a wide margin while maintaining data privacy. ",

    "abstract": "Estimating 6D poses of objects is an essential computer vision task. However, most conventional approaches rely on camera data from a single perspective and therefore suffer from occlusions. We overcome this issue with our novel multi-view 6D pose estimation method called MV6D which accurately predicts the 6D poses of all objects in a cluttered scene based on RGB-D images from multiple perspectives. We base our approach on the PVN3D network that uses a single RGB-D image to predict keypoints of the target objects. We extend this approach by using a combined point cloud from multiple views and fusing the images from each view with a DenseFusion layer. In contrast to current multi-view pose detection networks such as CosyPose, our MV6D can learn the fusion of multiple perspectives in an end-to-end manner and does not require multiple prediction stages or subsequent fine tuning of the prediction. Furthermore, we present three novel photorealistic datasets of cluttered scenes with heavy occlusions. All of them contain RGB-D images from multiple perspectives and the ground truth for instance semantic segmentation and 6D pose estimation. MV6D significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in multi-view 6D pose estimation even in cases where the camera poses are known inaccurately. Furthermore, we show that our approach is robust towards dynamic camera setups and that its accuracy increases incrementally with an increasing number of perspectives. ",

In this paper, we propose a methodology for predicting student performance from their online learning activities that optimizes inference accuracy over different demographic groups such as race and gender. Building upon recent foundations in federated learning, in our approach, personalized models for individual student subgroups are derived from a global model aggregated across all student models via meta-gradient updates that account for subgroup heterogeneity. To learn better representations of student activity, we augment our approach with a self-supervised behavioral pretraining methodology that leverages multiple modalities of student behavior (e.g., visits to lecture videos and participation on forums), and include a neural network attention mechanism in the model aggregation stage. Through experiments on three real-world datasets from online courses, we demonstrate that our approach obtains substantial improvements over existing student modeling baselines in predicting student learning outcomes for all subgroups. Visual analysis of the resulting student embeddings confirm that our personalization methodology indeed identifies different activity patterns within different subgroups, consistent with its stronger inference ability compared with the baselines.

    "abstract": "Learning a latent embedding to understand the underlying nature of data distribution is often formulated in Euclidean spaces with zero curvature. However, the success of the geometry constraints, posed in the embedding space, indicates that curved spaces might encode more structural information, leading to better discriminative power and hence richer representations. In this work, we investigate benefits of the curved space for analyzing anomalies or out-of-distribution objects in data. This is achieved by considering embeddings via three geometry constraints, namely, spherical geometry (with positive curvature), hyperbolic geometry (with negative curvature) or mixed geometry (with both positive and negative curvatures). Three geometric constraints can be chosen interchangeably in a unified design given the task at hand. Tailored for the embeddings in the curved space, we also formulate functions to compute the anomaly score. Two types of geometric modules (i.e., Geometric-in-One and Geometric-in-Two models) are proposed to plug in the original Euclidean classifier, and anomaly scores are computed from the curved embeddings. We evaluate the resulting designs under a diverse set of visual recognition scenarios, including image detection (multi-class OOD detection and one-class anomaly detection) and segmentation (multi-class anomaly segmentation and one-class anomaly segmentation). The empirical results show the effectiveness of our proposal through the consistent improvement over various scenarios. ",

While ANNs set state-of-the-art performance for many previously intractable problems, they require large amounts of data and computational resources for training, and since they employ supervised learning they typically need to know the correctly labelled response for every training example, limiting their scalability for real-world domains. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are an alternative to ANNs that use more brain-like artificial neurons and can use unsupervised learning to discover recognizable features in the input data without knowing correct responses. SNNs, however, struggle with dynamical stability and cannot match the accuracy of ANNs. Here we show how an SNN can overcome many of the shortcomings that have been identified in the literature, including offering a principled solution to the vanishing spike problem, to outperform all existing shallow SNNs and equal the performance of an ANN. It accomplishes this while using unsupervised learning with unlabeled data and only 1/50th of the training epochs (labelled data is used only for a final simple linear readout layer). This result makes SNNs a viable new method for fast, accurate, efficient, explainable, and re-deployable machine learning with unlabeled datasets. ",

However, this lacks an explanation of the specific information in the subband, and these features also lose information such as phase. Inspired by the mechanism of synthetic speech, the fundamental frequency (F0) information is used to improve the quality of synthetic speech, while the F0 of synthetic speech is still too average, which differs significantly from that of real speech. It is expected that F0 can be used as important information to discriminate between bonafide and fake speech, while this information cannot be used directly due to the irregular distribution of F0. Insteadly, the frequency band containing most of F0 is selected as the input feature. Meanwhile, to make full use of the phase and full-band information, we also propose to use real and imaginary spectrogram features as complementary input features and model the disjoint subbands separately. Finally, the results of F0, real and imaginary spectrogram features are fused. Experimental results on the ASVspoof 2019 LA dataset show that our proposed system is very effective for the audio deepfake detection task, achieving an equivalent error rate (EER) of 0.43%, which surpasses almost all systems.

    "abstract": "Graph-based collaborative filtering is capable of capturing the essential and abundant collaborative signals from the high-order interactions, and thus received increasingly research interests. Conventionally, the embeddings of users and items are defined in the Euclidean spaces, along with the propagation on the interaction graphs. Meanwhile, recent works point out that the high-order interactions naturally form up the tree-likeness structures, which the hyperbolic models thrive on. However, the interaction graphs inherently exhibit the hybrid and nested geometric characteristics, while the existing single geometry-based models are inadequate to fully capture such sophisticated topological patterns. In this paper, we propose to model the user-item interactions in a hybrid geometric space, in which the merits of Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces are simultaneously enjoyed to learn expressive representations. Experimental results on public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposal. ",

    "abstract": "Earth Observatory is a growing research area that can capitalize on the powers of AI for short time forecasting, a Now-casting scenario. In this work, we tackle the challenge of weather forecasting using a video transformer network. Vision transformer architectures have been explored in various applications, with major constraints being the computational complexity of Attention and the data hungry training. To address these issues, we propose the use of Video Swin-Transformer, coupled with a dedicated augmentation scheme. Moreover, we employ gradual spatial reduction on the encoder side and cross-attention on the decoder. The proposed approach is tested on the Weather4Cast2021 weather forecasting challenge data, which requires the prediction of 8 hours ahead future frames (4 per hour) from an hourly weather product sequence. The dataset was normalized to 0-1 to facilitate using the evaluation metrics across different datasets. The model results in an MSE score of 0.4750 when provided with training data, and 0.4420 during transfer learning without using training data, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation of images involve computationally intensive neural network architectures. Most of these methods are not adaptable to high-resolution image segmentation due to memory and other computational issues. Typical approaches in literature involve design of neural network architectures that can fuse global information from low-resolution images and local information from the high-resolution counterparts. However, architectures designed for processing high resolution images are unnecessarily complex and involve a lot of hyper parameters that can be difficult to tune. Also, most of these architectures require ground truth annotations of the high resolution images to train, which can be hard to obtain. In this article, we develop a robust pipeline based on mathematical morphological (MM) operators that can seamlessly extend any existing semantic segmentation algorithm to high resolution images. Our method does not require the ground truth annotations of the high resolution images. It is based on efficiently utilizing information from the low-resolution counterparts, and gradient information on the high-resolution images. We obtain high quality seeds from the inferred labels on low-resolution images using traditional morphological operators and propagate seed labels using a random walker to refine the semantic labels at the boundaries. We show that the semantic segmentation results obtained by our method beat the existing state-of-the-art algorithms on high-resolution images. We empirically prove the robustness of our approach to the hyper parameters used in our pipeline. Further, we characterize some necessary conditions under which our pipeline is applicable and provide an in-depth analysis of the proposed approach. ",

In this work, we investigate the possible reasons for the mentioned drawback in the architecture and mathematical theory of the current GANs.

To that end, we design a brand new architecture for the frequency domain using the blueprint of geometric deep learning.

    "abstract": "Reducing energy consumption is crucial to reduce the human debt's with regard to our planet. Therefore most companies try to reduce their energetic consumption while taking care to preserve the service delivered to their customers. To do so, a service provider (SP) typically downscale or shutdown part of its infrastructure in periods of low-activity where only few customers need the service. However an SP still needs to maintain part of its infrastructure \"on\", which still requires significant energy. For example a mobile national operator (MNO) needs to maintain most of its radio access network (RAN) active. Could an SP do better by cooperating with other SPs who would temporarily support its users, thus allowing it to temporarily shut down its infrastructure, and then reciprocate during another low-activity period? To answer this question, we investigated a novel collaboration framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) allowing negotiations between SPs as well as trustful reports from a distributed ledger technology (DLT) to evaluate the amount of energy being saved. We leveraged it to experiment three different sets of rules (free, recommended, or imposed) regulating the negotiation between multiple SPs (3, 4, 8, or 10). With respect to four cooperation metrics (efficiency, safety, incentive-compatibility, and fairness), the simulations showed that the imposed set of rules proved to be the best mode. ",

    "abstract": "This paper is dedicated to control theoretically explainable application of autoencoders to optimal fault detection in nonlinear dynamic systems. Autoencoder-based learning is a standard method of machine learning technique and widely applied for fault (anomaly) detection and classification. In the context of representation learning, the so-called latent (hidden) variable plays an important role towards an optimal fault detection. In ideal case, the latent variable should be a minimal sufficient statistic. The existing autoencoder-based fault detection schemes are mainly application-oriented, and few efforts have been devoted to optimal autoencoder-based fault detection and explainable applications. The main objective of our work is to establish a framework for learning autoencoder-based optimal fault detection in nonlinear dynamic systems. To this aim, a process model form for dynamic systems is firstly introduced with the aid of control and system theory, which also leads to a clear system interpretation of the latent variable. The major efforts are devoted to the development of a control theoretical solution to the optimal fault detection problem, in which an analog concept to minimal sufficient statistic, the so-called lossless information compression, is introduced for dynamic systems and fault detection specifications. In particular, the existence conditions for such a latent variable are derived, based on which a loss function and further a learning algorithm are developed. This learning algorithm enables optimally training of autoencoders to achieve an optimal fault detection in nonlinear dynamic systems. A case study on three-tank system is given at the end of this paper to illustrate the capability of the proposed autoencoder-based fault detection and to explain the essential role of the latent variable in the proposed fault detection system.

    "abstract": "Previous works on human motion prediction follow the pattern of building a mapping relation between the sequence observed and the one to be predicted. However, due to the inherent complexity of multivariate time series data, it still remains a challenge to find the extrapolation relation between motion sequences. In this paper, we present a new prediction pattern, which introduces previously overlooked human poses, to implement the prediction task from the view of interpolation. These poses exist after the predicted sequence, and form the privileged sequence. To be specific, we first propose an InTerPolation learning Network (ITP-Network) that encodes both the observed sequence and the privileged sequence to interpolate the in-between predicted sequence, wherein the embedded Privileged-sequence-Encoder (Priv-Encoder) learns the privileged knowledge (PK) simultaneously. Then, we propose a Final Prediction Network (FP-Network) for which the privileged sequence is not observable, but is equipped with a novel PK-Simulator that distills PK learned from the previous network. This simulator takes as input the observed sequence, but approximates the behavior of Priv-Encoder, enabling FP-Network to imitate the interpolation process. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our prediction pattern achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarked H3.6M, CMU-Mocap and 3DPW datasets in both short-term and long-term predictions.

One feasible approach is to take relation extraction and function detection as two independent sub-tasks. However, this separate learning method ignores the intrinsic correlation between them and leads to unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a joint learning model, which combines entity relation extraction and entity function detection to exploit their commonality and capture their inter-relationship, so as to improve the performance of biomedical causal relation extraction. Meanwhile, during the model training stage, different function types in the loss function are assigned different weights. Specifically, the penalty coefficient for negative function instances increases to effectively improve the precision of function detection. Experimental results on the BioCreative-V Track 4 corpus show that our joint learning model outperforms the separate models in BEL statement extraction, achieving the F1 scores of 58.4% and 37.3% on the test set in Stage 2 and Stage 1 evaluations, respectively.

Imputation of missing values has been considered an effective approach to deal with this challenge. Existing work separates imputation method and prediction model as two independent parts of an EHR-based machine learning system. We propose an integrated end-to-end approach by utilizing a Compound Density Network (CDNet) that allows the imputation method and prediction model to be tuned together within a single framework. CDNet consists of a Gated recurrent unit (GRU), a Mixture Density Network (MDN), and a Regularized Attention Network (RAN). The GRU is used as a latent variable model to model EHR data. The MDN is designed to sample latent variables generated by GRU. The RAN serves as a regularizer for less reliable imputed values. The architecture of CDNet enables GRU and MDN to iteratively leverage the output of each other to impute missing values, leading to a more accurate and robust prediction. We validate CDNet on the mortality prediction task on the MIMIC-III dataset. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art models by significant margins. We also empirically show that regularizing imputed values is a key factor for superior prediction performance. Analysis of prediction uncertainty shows that our model can capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, which offers model users a better understanding of the model results. ",

Typically, this depends on a semantic understanding which is based on supervised learning from images annotated by a human expert.

To address these challenges, we propose a method for predicting high- and low-risk terrains from only past vehicle experience in a self-supervised fashion. First, we develop a tool that projects the vehicle trajectory into the front camera image. Second, occlusions in the 3D representation of the terrain are filtered out. Third, an autoencoder trained on masked vehicle trajectory regions identifies low- and high-risk terrains based on the reconstruction error. We evaluated our approach with two models and different bottleneck sizes with two different training and testing sites with a fourwheeled off-road vehicle. Comparison with two independent test sets of semantic labels from similar terrain as training sites demonstrates the ability to separate the ground as low-risk and the vegetation as high-risk with 81.1% and 85.1% accuracy.

    "abstract": "Fault injection (FI) is a powerful attack methodology allowing an adversary to entirely break the security of a target device. As finite-state machines (FSMs) are fundamental hardware building blocks responsible for controlling systems, inducing faults into these controllers enables an adversary to hijack the execution of the integrated circuit. A common defense strategy mitigating these attacks is to manually instantiate FSMs multiple times and detect faults using a majority voting logic. However, as each additional FSM instance only provides security against one additional induced fault, this approach scales poorly in a multi-fault attack scenario. In this paper, we present SCFI: a strong, probabilistic FSM protection mechanism ensuring that control-flow deviations from the intended control-flow are detected even in the presence of multiple faults. At its core, SCFI consists of a hardened next-state function absorbing the execution history as well as the FSM's control signals to derive the next state. When either the absorbed inputs, the state registers, or the function itself are affected by faults, SCFI triggers an error with no detection latency. We integrate SCFI into a synthesis tool capable of automatically hardening arbitrary unprotected FSMs without user interaction and open-source the tool. Our evaluation shows that SCFI provides strong protection guarantees with a better area-time product than FSMs protected using classical redundancy-based approaches. Finally, we formally verify the resilience of the protected state machines using a pre-silicon fault analysis tool. ",

However, the function of this mechanism in machine learning has not been defined clearly. In this study, we propose to lay out a framework constituted by a bottom-up and a top-down network.

Our results show that the credit given by well-trained TDCA-network outperforms the gradient from backpropagation in classification task under different settings on multiple datasets. In addition, we successfully use a credit diffusing trick, which can keep training and testing performance remain unchanged, to reduce parameter complexity of the TDCA-network. More importantly, by comparing their trajectories in the parameter landscape, we find that TDCA-network directly achieved a global optimum, in contrast to that backpropagation only can gain a localized optimum. Thus, our results demonstrate that TDCA-network not only provide a biological plausible learning mechanism, but also has the potential to directly achieve global optimum, indicating that top-down credit assignment can substitute backpropagation, and provide a better learning framework for Deep Neural Networks.

An optimal defense, that minimizes the harm under constraints of the energy spent to maintain a large and diverse repertoire, must maintain coverage of the perimeter from a diverse attacker population. The model characterizes how a defense might take advantage of its ability to respond strongly to attackers of the same type but weakly to attackers of diverse types to minimize the number of diverse defenders and while reducing harm. We first study the model from a steady-state perimeter-defense perspective and then extend it to mobile defenders and evolving attacker distributions. The optimal defender distribution is supported on a discrete set and similarly a Kalman filter obtaining local information is able to track a discrete, sometimes unknown, attacker distribution. Simulation experiments are performed to study the efficacy of the model under different constraints. ",

(PQCrypto 2019), the authors introduced a new way to solve superdetermined instances of the MinRank problem, starting from the bilinear Kipnis-Shamir (KS) modeling. They use linear algebra on specific Macaulay matrices, considering only multiples of the initial equations by one block of variables, the so called ''kernel'' variables. Later, Bardet et al. (Asiacrypt 2020) introduced a new Support Minors modeling (SM), that consider the Pl{\\\"u}cker coordinates associated to the kernel variables, i.e. the maximal minors of the Kernel matrix in the KS modeling. In this paper, we give a complete algebraic explanation of the link between the (KS) and (SM) modelings (for any instance). We then show that superdetermined MinRank instances can be seen as easy instances of the SM modeling. In particular, we show that performing computation at the smallest possible degree (the ''first degree fall'') and the smallest possible number of variables is not always the best strategy. We give complexity estimates of the attack for generic random instances.We apply those results to the DAGS cryptosystem, that was submitted to the first round of the NIST standardization process. We show that the algebraic attack from Barelli and Couvreur (Asiacrypt 2018), improved in Bardet et al.

This includes pretraining, backbone, architectural design choices and loss functions. Many papers in this field claim novelty in either architecture design or loss formulation. However, simply updating the backbone of historical systems results in relative improvements of 25%, allowing them to outperform the majority of existing systems. A systematic evaluation of papers in this field was not straightforward. The need to compare like-with-like in previous papers means that longstanding errors in the evaluation protocol are ubiquitous in the field. It is likely that many papers were not only optimized for particular datasets, but also for errors in the data and evaluation criteria. To aid future research in this area, we release a modular codebase, allowing for easy evaluation of alternate design decisions against corrected data and evaluation criteria. We re-implement, validate and re-evaluate 16 state-of-the-art contributions and introduce a new dataset (SYNS-Patches) containing dense outdoor depth maps in a variety of both natural and urban scenes. This allows for the computation of informative metrics in complex regions such as depth boundaries. ",

Such approaches are prone to failure on near-in-distribution anomalies since these are difficult to be synthesized realistically due to their similarity to anomaly-free regions. We propose an architecture based on quantized feature space representation with dual decoders, DSR, that avoids the image-level anomaly synthesis requirement. Without making any assumptions about the visual properties of anomalies, DSR generates the anomalies at the feature level by sampling the learned quantized feature space, which allows a controlled generation of near-in-distribution anomalies. DSR achieves state-of-the-art results on the KSDD2 and MVTec anomaly detection datasets. The experiments on the challenging real-world KSDD2 dataset show that DSR significantly outperforms other unsupervised surface anomaly detection methods, improving the previous top-performing methods by 10% AP in anomaly detection and 35% AP in anomaly localization.

This work introduces two novel public datasets for CD in continuous manufacturing processes. The first dataset employs the well-known Tennessee Eastman simulator for fault detection and process control. The second dataset is extracted from an ultra-processed food manufacturing plant, and it includes a description of the plant, as well as multiple ground truths. These datasets are used to propose a benchmarking procedure based on different metrics and evaluated on a wide selection of CD algorithms. This work allows testing CD methods in realistic conditions enabling the selection of the most suitable method for specific target applications.

The current state of the art for these models does not provide explicit uncertainty quantification. This is arguably even more of a problem for this kind of tasks than elsewhere in machine learning, because the dynamical systems typically described by PDEs often exhibit subtle, multiscale structure that makes errors hard to spot by humans. In this work, we first provide a mathematically detailed Bayesian formulation of the ''shallow'' (linear) version of neural operators in the formalism of Gaussian processes. We then extend this analytic treatment to general deep neural operators using approximate methods from Bayesian deep learning. We extend previous results on neural operators by providing them with uncertainty quantification. As a result, our approach is able to identify cases, and provide structured uncertainty estimates, where the neural operator fails to predict well. ",

Therefore, the proposed networks are explicitly designed to extract input data representations of sparse stochastic nature, as opposed to the currently standard deterministic representation paradigm.

ViP3D employs sparse agent queries throughout the pipeline, making it fully differentiable and interpretable.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research is to assist managers and other decision-makers in making informed choices about the use of software vulnerability detection techniques through an empirical study of the efficiency and effectiveness of four techniques on a Java-based web application. METHOD: We apply four different categories of vulnerability detection techniques \\textendash~ systematic manual penetration testing (SMPT), exploratory manual penetration testing (EMPT), dynamic application security testing (DAST), and static application security testing (SAST) \\textendash\\ to an open-source medical records system. RESULTS: We found the most vulnerabilities using SAST. However, EMPT found more severe vulnerabilities. With each technique, we found unique vulnerabilities not found using the other techniques. The efficiency of manual techniques (EMPT, SMPT) was comparable to or better than the efficiency of automated techniques (DAST, SAST) in terms of Vulnerabilities per Hour (VpH). CONCLUSIONS: The vulnerability detection technique practitioners should select may vary based on the goals and available resources of the project. If the goal of an organization is to find \"all\" vulnerabilities in a project, they need to use as many techniques as their resources allow. ",

This has motivated a search for new hardware architectures optimized for artificial intelligence, such as electronic systolic arrays, memristor crossbar arrays, and optical accelerators. Optical systems can perform linear matrix operations at exceptionally high rate and efficiency, motivating recent demonstrations of low latency linear algebra and optical energy consumption below a photon per multiply-accumulate operation. However, demonstrating systems that co-integrate both linear and nonlinear processing units in a single chip remains a central challenge. Here we introduce such a system in a scalable photonic integrated circuit (PIC), enabled by several key advances: (i) high-bandwidth and low-power programmable nonlinear optical function units (NOFUs); (ii) coherent matrix multiplication units (CMXUs); and (iii) in situ training with optical acceleration. We experimentally demonstrate this fully-integrated coherent optical neural network (FICONN) architecture for a 3-layer DNN comprising 12 NOFUs and three CMXUs operating in the telecom C-band. Using in situ training on a vowel classification task, the FICONN achieves 92.7% accuracy on a test set, which is identical to the accuracy obtained on a digital computer with the same number of weights. This work lends experimental evidence to theoretical proposals for in situ training, unlocking orders of magnitude improvements in the throughput of training data. Moreover, the FICONN opens the path to inference at nanosecond latency and femtojoule per operation energy efficiency. ",

To address this issue, we propose in-distribution voting, a novel method to classify out-of-distribution images for multi-label classification. Using independent class-wise in-distribution (ID) predictors trained on ID and OOD data we achieve, on average, 99 % ID classification specificity and 98 % sensitivity, improving the end-to-end performance significantly compared to previous works on the chest X-ray 14 data set.

Once a network is embedded, dismantling is implemented using intuitive geometric strategies. We demonstrate that the approach well suits both Euclidean and hyperbolic network embeddings.

In contrast, routine inter-employee communication patterns within workplaces tend to emerge more naturally, as a consequence of both supervisory relationships and the needs of the organization. Scholars of organizational management have proposed theories relating organizational trees to communication dynamics and measures of business performance. Separately, network scientists have studied the topological structure of communication patterns in different types of organizations. However, the nature of the relationship between a formal organizational structure and emergent communications between employees remains unclear. In this paper, we study associations between organizational hierarchy and communication dynamics among approximately 200,000 employees of a large software company in May 2019. We propose new measures of communication reciprocity and new shortest-path distances for trees to characterize the frequency of messages passed up, down, and across the organizational hierarchy. By dividing the organization into 88 teams -- organizational trees rooted at the senior leadership level -- we identify distinct communication network structures within and between teams. These structures are related to the function of these teams within the company, including sales, marketing, engineering, and research. We discuss the relationship of routine employee communication patterns to supervisory hierarchies in this company, and empirically evaluate several theories of organizational management and performance.

The current paradigms with machine learning methods are often limited by the amount of labeled data. This phenomenon is particularly problematic for clinically-relevant data, where labeling at scale can be time-consuming and costly in terms of the specialized expertise and human effort required. Moreover, deep learning classifiers may be vulnerable to adversarial examples and perturbations, which could have catastrophic consequences, for example, when applied in the context of medical treatment, clinical trials, or insurance claims. In this paper, we propose a physiologically-inspired data augmentation method to improve performance and increase the robustness of heart disease detection based on ECG signals. We obtain augmented samples by perturbing the data distribution towards other classes along the geodesic in Wasserstein space. To better utilize domain-specific knowledge, we design a ground metric that recognizes the difference between ECG signals based on physiologically determined features. Learning from 12-lead ECG signals, our model is able to distinguish five categories of cardiac conditions. Our results demonstrate improvements in accuracy and robustness, reflecting the effectiveness of our data augmentation method. ",

We first develop an optimal IoT sensor placement strategy based on fire ignition and detection models. Then, we analyze the uplink satellite communication budget and the bandwidth required for wildfire detection under the narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) radio interface. Finally, we conduct simulations on the California wildfire database and quantify the potential economical benefits by factoring in carbon emission reductions and sensor/bandwidth costs. ",
