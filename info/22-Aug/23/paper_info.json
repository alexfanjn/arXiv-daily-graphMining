    "title": "A New Outlook on the Profitability of Rogue Mining Strategies in the  Bitcoin Network",
    "abstract": "Many of the recent works on the profitability of rogue mining strategies hinge on a parameter called $\\gamma$ that measures the proportion of the honest network attracted by the attacker to mine on top of his fork. These works, see arXiv:1808.01041 and arXiv.1805.08281, have surmised conclusions based on premises that erroneously treat $\\gamma$ to be constant. In this paper, we treat $\\gamma$ as a stochastic process and attempt to find its distribution through a Markov analysis. We begin by making strong assumptions on gamma's behaviour and proceed to translate them mathematically in order to apply them in a Markov setting. The aforementioned is executed in two separate occasions for two different models. Furthermore, we model the Bitcoin network and numerically derive a limiting distribution whereby the relative accuracy of our models is tested through a likelihood analysis. Finally, we conclude that even with control of 20% of the total hashrate, honest mining is the strongly dominant strategy. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning on source code (MLOnCode) promises to transform how software is delivered. By mining the context and relationship between software artefacts, MLOnCode augments the software developers capabilities with code auto-generation, code recommendation, code auto-tagging and other data-driven enhancements. For many of these tasks a script level representation of code is sufficient, however, in many cases a repository level representation that takes into account various dependencies and repository structure is imperative, for example, auto-tagging repositories with topics or auto-documentation of repository code etc. Existing methods for computing repository level representations suffer from (a) reliance on natural language documentation of code (for example, README files) (b) naive aggregation of method/script-level representation, for example, by concatenation or averaging. This paper introduces Topical a deep neural network to generate repository level embeddings of publicly available GitHub code repositories directly from source code. Topical incorporates an attention mechanism that projects the source code, the full dependency graph and the script level textual information into a dense repository-level representation. To compute the repository-level representations, Topical is trained to predict the topics associated with a repository, on a dataset of publicly available GitHub repositories that were crawled along with their ground truth topic tags. Our experiments show that the embeddings computed by Topical are able to outperform multiple baselines, including baselines that naively combine the method-level representations through averaging or concatenation at the task of repository auto-tagging.

    "abstract": "Representation learning often plays a critical role in reinforcement learning by managing the curse of dimensionality. A representative class of algorithms exploits a spectral decomposition of the stochastic transition dynamics to construct representations that enjoy strong theoretical properties in an idealized setting. However, current spectral methods suffer from limited applicability because they are constructed for state-only aggregation and derived from a policy-dependent transition kernel, without considering the issue of exploration. To address these issues, we propose an alternative spectral method, Spectral Decomposition Representation (SPEDER), that extracts a state-action abstraction from the dynamics without inducing spurious dependence on the data collection policy, while also balancing the exploration-versus-exploitation trade-off during learning. A theoretical analysis establishes the sample efficiency of the proposed algorithm in both the online and offline settings. In addition, an experimental investigation demonstrates superior performance over current state-of-the-art algorithms across several benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Conventional anti-jamming methods mainly focus on preventing single jammer attacks with an invariant jamming policy or jamming attacks from multiple jammers with similar jamming policies. These anti-jamming methods are ineffective against a single jammer following several different jamming policies or multiple jammers with distinct policies. Therefore, this paper proposes an anti-jamming method that can adapt its policy to the current jamming attack. Moreover, for the multiple jammers scenario, an anti-jamming method that estimates the future occupied channels using the jammers' occupied channels in previous time slots is proposed. In both single and multiple jammers scenarios, the interaction between the users and jammers is modeled using recurrent neural networks (RNN)s. The performance of the proposed anti-jamming methods is evaluated by calculating the users' successful transmission rate (STR) and ergodic rate (ER), and compared to a baseline based on Q-learning (DQL). Simulation results show that for the single jammer scenario, all the considered jamming policies are perfectly detected and high STR and ER are maintained. Moreover, when 70 % of the spectrum is under jamming attacks from multiple jammers, the proposed method achieves an STR and ER greater than 75 % and 80 %, respectively. These values rise to 90 % when 30 % of the spectrum is under jamming attacks. In addition, the proposed anti-jamming methods significantly outperform the DQL method for all the considered cases and jamming scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "The recent popularity of edge devices and Artificial Intelligent of Things (AIoT) has driven a new wave of contextual recommendations, such as location based Point of Interest (PoI) recommendations and computing resource-aware mobile app recommendations. In many such recommendation scenarios, contexts are drifting over time. For example, in a mobile game recommendation, contextual features like locations, battery, and storage levels of mobile devices are frequently drifting over time. However, most existing graph-based collaborative filtering methods are designed under the assumption of static features. Therefore, they would require frequent retraining and/or yield graphical models burgeoning in sizes, impeding their suitability for context-drifting recommendations. In this work, we propose a specifically tailor-made Hybrid Static and Adaptive Graph Embedding (HySAGE) network for context-drifting recommendations. Our key idea is to disentangle the relatively static user-item interaction and rapidly drifting contextual features. Specifically, our proposed HySAGE network learns a relatively static graph embedding from user-item interaction and an adaptive embedding from drifting contextual features. These embeddings are incorporated into an interest network to generate the user interest in some certain context. We adopt an interactive attention module to learn the interactions among static graph embeddings, adaptive contextual embeddings, and user interest, helping to achieve a better final representation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HySAGE significantly improves the performance of the existing state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms. ",

Monitoring traffic flows in a smart city using different surveillance cameras can play a significant role in recognizing accidents and alerting first responders. The utilization of action recognition (AR) in computer vision tasks has contributed towards high-precision applications in video surveillance, medical imaging, and digital signal processing. This paper presents an intensive review focusing on action recognition in accident detection and autonomous transportation systems for a smart city. In this paper, we focused on AR systems that used diverse sources of traffic video capturing, such as static surveillance cameras on traffic intersections, highway monitoring cameras, drone cameras, and dash-cams. Through this review, we identified the primary techniques, taxonomies, and algorithms used in AR for autonomous transportation and accident detection. We also examined data sets utilized in the AR tasks, identifying the main sources of datasets and features of the datasets. This paper provides potential research direction to develop and integrate accident detection systems for autonomous cars and public traffic safety systems by alerting emergency personnel and law enforcement in the event of road accidents to minimize human error in accident reporting and provide a spontaneous response to victims ",

    "abstract": "In many fields of scientific research and real-world applications, unbiased estimation of causal effects from non-experimental data is crucial for understanding the mechanism underlying the data and for decision-making on effective responses or interventions. A great deal of research has been conducted on this challenging problem from different angles. For causal effect estimation in data, assumptions such as Markov property, faithfulness and causal sufficiency are always made. Under the assumptions, full knowledge such as, a set of covariates or an underlying causal graph, is still required. A practical challenge is that in many applications, no such full knowledge or only some partial knowledge is available. In recent years, research has emerged to use a search strategy based on graphical causal modelling to discover useful knowledge from data for causal effect estimation, with some mild assumptions, and has shown promose in tackling the practical challenge. In this survey, we review the methods and focus on the challenges the data-driven methods face. We discuss the assumptions, strengths and limitations of the data-driven methods. We hope this review will motivate more researchers to design better data-driven methods based on graphical causal modelling for the challenging problem of causal effect estimation. ",

Our approach is inspired by the saddle-point method -- a ubiquitous numerical technique in statistics. We prove rigorous performance guarantees by deriving upper and lower bounds for the approximation error offered by SPA. The crux of SPA is a combination of large-deviation methods with central limit theorems, which we derive via exponentially tilting the privacy loss random variables corresponding to the DP mechanisms. One key advantage of SPA is that it runs in constant time for the $n$-fold composition of a privacy mechanism. Numerical experiments demonstrate that SPA achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art accounting methods with a faster runtime. ",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image synthesis aims to generate a photo-realistic and semantic consistent image from a specific text description. The images synthesized by off-the-shelf models usually contain limited components compared with the corresponding image and text description, which decreases the image quality and the textual-visual consistency. To address this issue, we propose a novel Vision-Language Matching strategy for text-to-image synthesis, named VLMGAN*, which introduces a dual vision-language matching mechanism to strengthen the image quality and semantic consistency. The dual vision-language matching mechanism considers textual-visual matching between the generated image and the corresponding text description, and visual-visual consistent constraints between the synthesized image and the real image. Given a specific text description, VLMGAN* firstly encodes it into textual features and then feeds them to a dual vision-language matching-based generative model to synthesize a photo-realistic and textual semantic consistent image. Besides, the popular evaluation metrics for text-to-image synthesis are borrowed from simple image generation, which mainly evaluates the reality and diversity of the synthesized images. Therefore, we introduce a metric named Vision-Language Matching Score (VLMS) to evaluate the performance of text-to-image synthesis which can consider both the image quality and the semantic consistency between synthesized image and the description. The proposed dual multi-level vision-language matching strategy can be applied to other text-to-image synthesis methods. We implement this strategy on two popular baselines, which are marked with ${\\text{VLMGAN}_{+\\text{AttnGAN}}}$ and ${\\text{VLMGAN}_{+\\text{DFGAN}}}$. The experimental results on two widely-used datasets show that the model achieves significant improvements over other state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, e-learning platforms have grown as a place where students can post doubts (as a snap taken with smart phones) and get them resolved in minutes. However, the significant increase in the number of student-posted doubts with high variance in quality on these platforms not only presents challenges for teachers' navigation to address them but also increases the resolution time per doubt. Both are not acceptable, as high doubt resolution time hinders the students learning progress. This necessitates ways to automatically identify if there exists a similar doubt in repository and then serve it to the teacher as the plausible solution to validate and communicate with the student. Supervised learning techniques (like Siamese architecture) require labels to identify the matches, which is not feasible as labels are scarce and expensive. In this work, we, thus, developed a label-agnostic doubt matching paradigm based on the representations learnt via self-supervised technique. Building on prior theoretical insights of BYOL (bootstrap your own latent space), we propose custom BYOL which combines domain-specific augmentation with contrastive objective over a varied set of appropriately constructed data views. Results highlighted that, custom BYOL improves the top-1 matching accuracy by approximately 6\\% and 5\\% as compared to both BYOL and supervised learning instances, respectively. We further show that both BYOL-based learning instances performs either on par or better than human labeling. ",

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers have emerged as a powerful architecture that can outperform convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks. Several attempts have been made to understand robustness of Transformers against adversarial attacks, but existing studies draw inconsistent results, i.e., some conclude that Transformers are more robust than CNNs, while some others find that they have similar degrees of robustness. In this paper, we address two issues unexplored in the existing studies examining adversarial robustness of Transformers. First, we argue that the image quality should be simultaneously considered in evaluating adversarial robustness. We find that the superiority of one architecture to another in terms of robustness can change depending on the attack strength expressed by the quality of the attacked images. Second, by noting that Transformers and CNNs rely on different types of information in images, we formulate an attack framework, called Fourier attack, as a tool for implementing flexible attacks, where an image can be attacked in the spectral domain as well as in the spatial domain. This attack perturbs the magnitude and phase information of particular frequency components selectively. Through extensive experiments, we find that Transformers tend to rely more on phase information and low frequency information than CNNs, and thus sometimes they are even more vulnerable under frequency-selective attacks. It is our hope that this work provides new perspectives in understanding the properties and adversarial robustness of Transformers. ",

As a thriving field in natural language processing, there has been a large amount of corpus for academic study and application development in argument mining.

Specifically, all the publicly available datasets are relatively small in scale, and few of them provide information from other modalities to facilitate the learning process. Moreover, the statements and expressions in these corpora are usually in a compact form, which means non-adjacent clauses or text segments will always be regarded as multiple individual components, thus restricting the generalization ability of models. To this end, we collect and contribute a novel dataset AntCritic to serve as a helpful complement to this area, which consists of about 10k free-form and visually-rich financial comments and supports both argument component detection and argument relation prediction tasks. Besides, in order to cope with the challenges and difficulties brought by scenario expansion and problem setting modification, we thoroughly explore the fine-grained relation prediction and structure reconstruction scheme for free-form documents and discuss the encoding mechanism for visual styles and layouts. And based on these analyses, we design two simple but effective model architectures and conduct various experiments on this dataset to provide benchmark performances as a reference and verify the practicability of our proposed architecture.

Refactoring techniques may enhance testability by improving the software metrics affecting testability. The metrics are determined while building regression models learning how to relate metrics computed for a source code to its testability. We identified 15 software metrics highly affecting testability while interpreting our testability prediction model. Our experiments with 42 java classes reveal that refactorings that improve these 15 metrics could enhance testability by an average of 15.57%, besides improving some other quality attributes. Our testability prediction model is trained to map source code metrics to test effectiveness and efficiency as two significant ingredients of testable software. Test effectiveness improves as the coverage gained by the test suite increases. On the other hand, the test efficiency reduces as the size of the test suite increases. This article offers a mathematical model to compute class testability in terms of the size and coverage of the test suite. We use this mathematical model to compute testability as the target of our testability prediction model. The mathematical model requires the execution of the class under test to compute test coverage, while our regression model measures testability statically. Prediction of test results in terms of testability should precede the test to avoid unnecessary costs. Our testability prediction model has been trained and tested on 23,886 Java classes and 262 software metrics.

Determining accurate folding landscape using co-evolutionary information is fundamental to the success of modern protein structure prediction methods. As the state of the art, AlphaFold2 has dramatically raised the accuracy without performing explicit co-evolutionary analysis. Nevertheless, its performance still shows strong dependence on available sequence homologs. We investigated the cause of such dependence and presented EvoGen, a meta generative model, to remedy the underperformance of AlphaFold2 for poor MSA targets. EvoGen allows us to manipulate the folding landscape either by denoising the searched MSA or by generating virtual MSA, and helps AlphaFold2 fold accurately in low-data regime or even achieve encouraging performance with single-sequence predictions. Being able to make accurate predictions with few-shot MSA not only generalizes AlphaFold2 better for orphan sequences, but also democratizes its use for high-throughput applications. Besides, EvoGen combined with AlphaFold2 yields a probabilistic structure generation method which could explore alternative conformations of protein sequences, and the task-aware differentiable algorithm for sequence generation will benefit other related tasks including protein design.

As of late, they have also established themselves in the biomedical and healthcare domains, where they have shown a lot of promise, but have not yet achieved widespread adoption. This is in part due to the fact that most methods fail to maintain their performance when they are called to make decisions on data that originate from a different distribution than the one they were trained on, namely Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data. For example, in the case of biosignal classification, models often fail to generalize well on datasets from different hospitals, due to the distribution discrepancy amongst different sources of data. Our goal is to demonstrate the Domain Generalization problem present between distinct hospital databases and propose a method that classifies abnormalities on 12-lead Electrocardiograms (ECGs), by leveraging information extracted across the architecture of a Deep Neural Network, and capturing the underlying structure of the signal. To this end, we adopt a ResNet-18 as the backbone model and extract features from several intermediate convolutional layers of the network. To evaluate our method, we adopt publicly available ECG datasets from four sources and handle them as separate domains. To simulate the distributional shift present in real-world settings, we train our model on a subset of the domains and leave-out the remaining ones. We then evaluate our model both on the data present at training time (intra-distribution) and the held-out data (out-of-distribution), achieving promising results and surpassing the baseline of a vanilla Residual Network in most of the cases.

    "abstract": "Event detection (ED), aiming to detect events from texts and categorize them, is vital to understanding actual happenings in real life. However, mainstream event detection models require high-quality expert human annotations of triggers, which are often costly and thus deter the application of ED to new domains. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on low-resource ED without triggers and aim to tackle the following formidable challenges: multi-label classification, insufficient clues, and imbalanced events distribution. We propose a novel trigger-free ED method via Derangement mechanism on a machine Reading Comprehension (DRC) framework. More specifically, we treat the input text as Context and concatenate it with all event type tokens that are deemed as Answers with an omitted default question. So we can leverage the self-attention in pre-trained language models to absorb semantic relations between input text and the event types. Moreover, we design a simple yet effective event derangement module (EDM) to prevent major events from being excessively learned so as to yield a more balanced training process. The experiment results show that our proposed trigger-free ED model is remarkably competitive to mainstream trigger-based models, showing its strong performance on low-source event detection. ",

The package provides the time series distance functions that can be easily computed in parallel and in supercomputers to process larger data sets and methods to transform distance matrices into networks. Ts2net also provides methods to transform a single time series into a network, such as recurrence networks, visibility graphs, and transition networks.

We formulate the pairwise distance calculation as solving an all-pairs shortest path problem. To improve efficiency, we decompose this problem into a set of single-source shortest path problems. The time complexity is reduced from O(kn^2N) to O(knN). Architectures are hierarchically clustered according to the distances between them. A circle-packing-based architecture visualization has been developed to convey both the global relationships between clusters and local neighborhoods of the architectures in each cluster. Two case studies and a post-analysis are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of ArchExplorer in summarizing design principles and selecting better-performing architectures. ",

    "abstract": "Video object detection (VID) is challenging because of the high variation of object appearance as well as the diverse deterioration in some frames. On the positive side, the detection in a certain frame of a video, compared with in a still image, can draw support from other frames. Hence, how to aggregate features across different frames is pivotal to the VID problem. Most of existing aggregation algorithms are customized for two-stage detectors. But, the detectors in this category are usually computationally expensive due to the two-stage nature. This work proposes a simple yet effective strategy to address the above concerns, which spends marginal overheads with significant gains in accuracy. Concretely, different from the traditional two-stage pipeline, we advocate putting the region-level selection after the one-stage detection to avoid processing massive low-quality candidates. Besides, a novel module is constructed to evaluate the relationship between a target frame and its reference ones, and guide the aggregation. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted to verify the efficacy of our design, and reveal its superiority over other state-of-the-art VID approaches in both effectiveness and efficiency. Our YOLOX-based model can achieve promising performance (e.g., 87.5\\% AP50 at over 30 FPS on the ImageNet VID dataset on a single 2080Ti GPU), making it attractive for large-scale or real-time applications.

    "abstract": "While deep Embedding Learning approaches have witnessed widespread success in multiple computer vision tasks, the state-of-the-art methods for representing natural images need not necessarily perform well on images from other domains, such as paintings, cartoons, and sketch. This is because of the huge shift in the distribution of data from across these domains, as compared to natural images. Domains like sketch often contain sparse informative pixels. However, recognizing objects in such domains is crucial, given multiple relevant applications leveraging such data, for instance, sketch to image retrieval. Thus, achieving an Embedding Learning model that could perform well across multiple domains is not only challenging, but plays a pivotal role in computer vision. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Embedding Learning approach with the goal of generalizing across different domains. During training, given a query image from a domain, we employ gated fusion and attention to generate a positive example, which carries a broad notion of the semantics of the query object category (from across multiple domains). By virtue of Contrastive Learning, we pull the embeddings of the query and positive, in order to learn a representation which is robust across domains. At the same time, to teach the model to be discriminative against examples from different semantic categories (across domains), we also maintain a pool of negative embeddings (from different categories). We show the prowess of our method using the DomainBed framework, on the popular PACS (Photo, Art painting, Cartoon, and Sketch) dataset. ",

Recent investigations propose multiplication-free neural networks to reduce computation and memory consumption. Shift neural network is one of the most effective tools towards these reductions. However, existing low-bit shift networks are not as accurate as their full precision counterparts and cannot efficiently transfer to a wide range of tasks due to their inherent design flaws. We propose DenseShift network that exploits the following novel designs. First, we demonstrate that the zero-weight values in low-bit shift networks are neither useful to the model capacity nor simplify the model inference. Therefore, we propose to use a zero-free shifting mechanism to simplify inference while increasing the model capacity. Second, we design a new metric to measure the weight freezing issue in training low-bit shift networks, and propose a sign-scale decomposition to improve the training efficiency. Third, we propose the low-variance random initialization strategy to improve the model's performance in transfer learning scenarios. We run extensive experiments on various computer vision and speech tasks. The experimental results show that DenseShift network significantly outperforms existing low-bit multiplication-free networks and can achieve competitive performance to the full-precision counterpart.

LLMs have been fine tuned and packaged so that programmers can use them in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write code.

We thus conducted a user study (N=58) to assess the security of code written by student programmers when guided by LLMs. Half of the students in our study had the help of the LLM and the other half did not. The students were asked to write code in C that performed operations over a singly linked list, including node operations such as inserting, updating, removing, combining, and others. While the results of our study showed that the students who had the help of an LLM were more likely to write functional code, no generalizable impact on security was observed -- the security impacts were localized to individual functions. We also investigate systematic stylistic differences between unaided and LLM-assisted code, finding that LLM code is more repetitive, which may have an amplifying effect if vulnerable code is repeated in addition to the impact on source code attribution.

Differential privacy (DP) is the protection model of choice to ensure the privacy of the individuals who generated the raw location data. However, current solutions fail to preserve data utility when each individual contributes multiple location reports (i.e., under user-level privacy). To offset this limitation, public releases by Meta and Google use high privacy budgets (e.g., $\\epsilon$=10-100), resulting in poor privacy. We propose a novel approach to release spatio-temporal data privately and accurately. We employ the pattern recognition power of neural networks, specifically variational auto-encoders (VAE), to reduce the noise introduced by DP mechanisms such that accuracy is increased, while the privacy requirement is still satisfied. Our extensive experimental evaluation on real datasets shows the clear superiority of our approach compared to benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Node classification using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios. However, in recent years, compelling evidence emerges that the performance of GNN-based node classification may deteriorate substantially by topological perturbation, such as random connections or adversarial attacks. Various solutions, such as topological denoising methods and mechanism design methods, have been proposed to develop robust GNN-based node classifiers but none of these works can fully address the problems related to topological perturbations. Recently, the Bayesian label transition model is proposed to tackle this issue but its slow convergence may lead to inferior performance. In this work, we propose a new label inference model, namely LInDT, which integrates both Bayesian label transition and topology-based label propagation for improving the robustness of GNNs against topological perturbations. LInDT is superior to existing label transition methods as it improves the label prediction of uncertain nodes by utilizing neighborhood-based label propagation leading to better convergence of label inference. Besides, LIndT adopts asymmetric Dirichlet distribution as a prior, which also helps it to improve label inference. Extensive experiments on five graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of LInDT for GNN-based node classification under three scenarios of topological perturbations. ",

    "abstract": "Link prediction analysis becomes vital to acquire a deeper understanding of events underlying social networks interactions and connections especially in current evolving and large-scale social networks. Traditional link prediction approaches underperformed for most large-scale social networks in terms of its scalability and efficiency. Spark is a distributed open-source framework that facilitate scalable link prediction efficiency in large-scale social networks. The framework provides numerous tunable properties for users to manually configure the parameters for the applications. However, manual configurations open to performance issue when the applications start scaling tremendously, which is hard to set up and expose to human errors. This paper introduced a novel Self-Configured Framework (SCF) to provide an autonomous feature in Spark that predicts and sets the best configuration instantly before the application execution using XGBoost classifier. SCF is evaluated on the Twitter social network using three link prediction applications: Graph Clustering (GC), Overlapping Community Detection (OCD), and Redundant Graph Clustering (RGD) to assess the impact of shifting data sizes on different applications in Twitter. The result demonstrates a 40% reduction in prediction time as well as a balanced resource consumption that makes full use of resources, especially for limited number and size of clusters ",

    "abstract": "3D Point cloud is becoming a critical data representation in many real-world applications like autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging. Although the success of deep learning further accelerates the adoption of 3D point clouds in the physical world, deep learning is notorious for its vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this work, we first identify that the state-of-the-art empirical defense, adversarial training, has a major limitation in applying to 3D point cloud models due to gradient obfuscation. We further propose PointDP, a purification strategy that leverages diffusion models to defend against 3D adversarial attacks. We extensively evaluate PointDP on six representative 3D point cloud architectures, and leverage 10+ strong and adaptive attacks to demonstrate its lower-bound robustness. Our evaluation shows that PointDP achieves significantly better robustness than state-of-the-art purification methods under strong attacks. Results of certified defenses on randomized smoothing combined with PointDP will be included in the near future. ",

    "abstract": "Joint radar and communication (JRC) is a promising technique for spectrum re-utilization, which enables radar sensing and data transmission to operate on the same frequencies and the same devices. However, due to the multi-objective property of JRC systems, channel allocation to JRC nodes should be carefully designed to maximize system performance. Additionally, because of the broadcast nature of wireless signals, a watchful adversary, i.e., a warden, can detect ongoing transmissions and attack the system. Thus, we develop a covert JRC system that minimizes the detection probability by wardens, in which friendly jammers are deployed to improve the covertness of the JRC nodes during radar sensing and data transmission operations. Furthermore, we propose a robust multi-item auction design for channel allocation for such a JRC system that considers the uncertainty in bids. The proposed auction mechanism achieves the properties of truthfulness, individual rationality, budget feasibility, and computational efficiency. The simulations clearly show the benefits of our design to support covert JRC systems and to provide incentive to the JRC nodes in obtaining spectrum, in which the auction-based channel allocation mechanism is robust against perturbations in the bids, which is highly effective for JRC nodes working in uncertain environments.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graph (KG) embedding seeks to learn vector representations for entities and relations. Conventional models reason over graph structures, but they suffer from the issues of graph incompleteness and long-tail entities. Recent studies have used pre-trained language models to learn embeddings based on the textual information of entities and relations, but they cannot take advantage of graph structures. In the paper, we show empirically that these two kinds of features are complementary for KG embedding. To this end, we propose CoLE, a Co-distillation Learning method for KG Embedding that exploits the complementarity of graph structures and text information. Its graph embedding model employs Transformer to reconstruct the representation of an entity from its neighborhood subgraph. Its text embedding model uses a pre-trained language model to generate entity representations from the soft prompts of their names, descriptions, and relational neighbors. To let the two model promote each other, we propose co-distillation learning that allows them to distill selective knowledge from each other's prediction logits. In our co-distillation learning, each model serves as both a teacher and a student. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the two models outperform their related baselines, and the ensemble method CoLE with co-distillation learning advances the state-of-the-art of KG embedding.

The key insight of our framework is inspired by the existing counterfactual analysis using twins, where the researchers regard twins as counterfactual units. The proposed framework regards a pair of papers that cite each other as twins. Such papers tend to be parallel works, on similar topics, and in similar communities. We investigate twin papers that adopted different decisions, observe the progress of the research impact brought by these studies, and estimate the effect of decisions by the difference in the impacts of these studies.

Sigmoid-like neural networks have been adopted in a wide range of applications. Due to their non-linearity, Sigmoid-like activation functions are usually over-approximated for efficient verification, which inevitably introduces imprecision. Considerable efforts have been devoted to finding the so-called tighter approximations to obtain more precise verification results. However, existing tightness definitions are heuristic and lack theoretical foundations. We conduct a thorough empirical analysis of existing neuron-wise characterizations of tightness and reveal that they are superior only on specific neural networks. We then introduce the notion of network-wise tightness as a unified tightness definition and show that computing network-wise tightness is a complex non-convex optimization problem. We bypass the complexity from different perspectives via two efficient, provably tightest approximations. The results demonstrate the promising performance achievement of our approaches over state of the art: (i) achieving up to 251.28% improvement to certified lower robustness bounds; and (ii) exhibiting notably more precise verification results on convolutional networks.

Moreover, a bi-directional interaction module across the two paths is developed to provide complementary clues in the channel and spatial dimensions. We also upgrade the concentration operation by adding an extra multi-head attention layer to it.

Current approaches are mostly based on supervised methods which require large fully labeled data to train supervised models and suffer from pseudo label bias because of class imbalance issues. However large image datasets with bounding box annotations are often scarcely available. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a means for training large models using only a modest amount of annotated data; apart from reducing the annotation cost. SSL has also shown promise to produce models that are more robust and generalizable. Therefore, in this paper we introduce a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework in surgical tool detection paradigm which aims to mitigate the scarcity of training data and the data imbalance through a knowledge distillation approach. In the proposed work, we train a model with labeled data which initialises the Teacher-Student joint learning, where the Student is trained on Teacher-generated pseudo labels from unlabeled data. We propose a multi-class distance with a margin based classification loss function in the region-of-interest head of the detector to effectively segregate foreground classes from background region. Our results on m2cai16-tool-locations dataset indicate the superiority of our approach on different supervised data settings (1%, 2%, 5%, 10% of annotated data) where our model achieves overall improvements of 8%, 12% and 27% in mAP (on 1% labeled data) over the state-of-the-art SSL methods and a fully supervised baseline, respectively.

In recent decades computer-supported innovations have also been introduced in hardware design, usability, and aesthetics. One of the most commonly digitally augmented instruments is the piano. Besides electronic keyboards, several prototypes augmenting pianos with different projections providing various levels of interactivity on and around the keyboard have been implemented in order to support piano players. However, it is still not understood if these solutions are indeed supporting the learning process. In this paper we present a systematic review of augmented piano prototypes focusing on instrument learning, which is based on the four themes derived from interviews of piano experts to better understand the problems of teaching the piano. These themes are: (i) synchronised movement and body posture, (ii) sight-reading, (iii) ensuring motivation, and (iv) encouraging improvisation. We found that prototypes are saturated on the synchronisation themes, and there are opportunities for sight-reading, motivation, and improvisation themes. We conclude by presenting recommendations on augmenting piano systems towards enriching the piano learning experience as well as on possible directions to expand knowledge in the area. ",

    "abstract": "The dominance of a few big companies in the storage market arising various concerns including single point of failure, privacy violation, and oligopoly. To eliminate the dependency on such a centralized storage architecture, several Decentralized Storage Network (DSN) schemes such as Filecoin, Sia, and Storj have been introduced. DSNs leverage blockchain technology to create a storage platform such that the micro storage providers can also participate in the storage market. To verify the accurate data storage by the storage providers during a storage contract, DSNs apply a Proof of Storage (PoS) scheme to continuously inspect the storage service. However, continuous verification of the storage provider imposes an extra cost to the network and therefore end-users. Moreover, DSN's PoS verification is vulnerable to a service denying attack in which the storage provider submits valid PoS to the network while denying the service to the client. Considering the benefits and existing challenges of DSNs, this paper introduces a novel incentive-compatible DSN scheme. In this scheme, the PoS is conducted only if the client submits a challenge request. We model the storage service as a repeated dynamic game and set the players' payoffs such that the storage provider's dominant strategy is to honestly follow the storage contract. Our proposed mechanism leverages the smart-contract and oracle network to govern the storage agreement between the client and storage provider efficiently. Furthermore, our scheme is independent of a specific blockchain platform but can be plugged into any blockchain platform with smart-contract execution capability. As a proof of concept, we have implemented our scheme using solidity language and chainlink oracle network. The performance analysis demonstrates the applicability of our scheme. ",

We argue that there is limited research on this problem within the context of the Global South and present an approach for tackling them. Prior works have shown how machine learning models built with user-level interaction features can effectively identify users who spread inflammatory content. While this technique is beneficial in low-resource language settings where linguistic resources such as ground truth data and processing capabilities are lacking, it is still unclear how these interaction features contribute to model performance. In this work, we investigate and show significant differences in interaction features between users who spread inflammatory content and others who do not, applying explainability tools to understand our trained model. We find that features with higher interaction significance (such as account age and activity count) show higher explanatory power than features with lower interaction significance (such as name length and if the user has a location on their bio). Our work extends research directions that aim to understand the nature of inflammatory content in low-resource, high-risk contexts as the growth of social media use in the Global South outstrips moderation efforts.

In light of this, we study the problem of generative SSL on heterogeneous graphs and propose HGMAE, a novel heterogeneous graph masked autoencoder model to address these challenges. HGMAE captures comprehensive graph information via two innovative masking techniques and three unique training strategies. In particular, we first develop metapath masking and adaptive attribute masking with dynamic mask rate to enable effective and stable learning on heterogeneous graphs. We then design several training strategies including metapath-based edge reconstruction to adopt complex structural information, target attribute restoration to incorporate various node attributes, and positional feature prediction to encode node positional information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HGMAE outperforms both contrastive and generative state-of-the-art baselines on several tasks across multiple datasets. ",

Specifically, we first develop a targeted attack formulation to maximally increase a target item's popularity. We then leverage gradient-based optimizations to find a solution. However, we observe the gradient estimates often appear noisy due to the discrete nature of a graph, which leads to a degradation of attack ability. To resolve noisy gradient effects, we then propose a masked attack objective that can remarkably enhance the topological attack ability. Furthermore, we design a computationally efficient approach to the proposed attack, thus making it feasible to evaluate large-large CF systems. Experiments on two real-world datasets show the effectiveness of our attack in analyzing the robustness of GNN-based CF more practically. ",

To better capture and incorporate the global semantic information into PLMs, the graph contrastive topic model integrates the hierarchical transformer encoder and the graph contrastive learning to fuse the semantic information from the global document context and the gold summary.

    "abstract": "We find experimentally that when artificial neural networks are connected in parallel and trained together, they display the following properties. (i) When the parallel-connected neural network (PNN) is optimized, each sub-network in the connection is not optimized. (ii) The contribution of an inferior sub-network to the whole PNN can be on par with that of the superior sub-network. (iii) The PNN can output the correct result even when all sub-networks give incorrect results. These properties are unlikely for natural biological sense organs. Therefore, they could serve as a simple yet effective criterion for measuring the bionic level of neural networks. With this criterion, we further show that when serving as the activation function, the ReLU function can make an artificial neural network more bionic than the sigmoid and Tanh functions do. ",

    "abstract": "Code generation focuses on the automatic conversion of natural language (NL) utterances into code snippets. The sequence-to-tree (Seq2Tree) methods, e.g., TRANX, are proposed for code generation, with the guarantee of the compilability of the generated code, which generate the subsequent Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node relying on antecedent predictions of AST nodes. Existing Seq2Tree methods tend to treat both antecedent predictions and subsequent predictions equally. However, under the AST constraints, it is difficult for Seq2Tree models to produce the correct subsequent prediction based on incorrect antecedent predictions. Thus, antecedent predictions ought to receive more attention than subsequent predictions. To this end, in this paper, we propose an effective method, named APTRANX (Antecedent Prioritized TRANX), on the basis of TRANX. APTRANX contains an Antecedent Prioritized (AP) Loss, which helps the model attach importance to antecedent predictions by exploiting the position information of the generated AST nodes. With better antecedent predictions and accompanying subsequent predictions, APTRANX significantly improves the performance. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority and generality of our proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Existing methods attempt to address this scalability issue by training multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) exclusively on node content features using labels derived from trained GNNs. Even though the performance of MLPs can be significantly improved, two issues prevent MLPs from outperforming GNNs and being used in practice: the ignorance of graph structural information and the sensitivity to node feature noises. In this paper, we propose to learn NOise-robust Structure-aware MLPs On Graphs (NOSMOG) to overcome the challenges. Specifically, we first complement node content with position features to help MLPs capture graph structural information. We then design a novel representational similarity distillation strategy to inject structural node similarities into MLPs. Finally, we introduce the adversarial feature augmentation to ensure stable learning against feature noises and further improve performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NOSMOG outperforms GNNs and the state-of-the-art method in both transductive and inductive settings across seven datasets, while maintaining a competitive inference efficiency.

The notion of a neighbor is often based on binary considerations, such as the k nearest neighbors. However, considering that data is often organized as a manifold with low intrinsic dimension, the notion of a neighbor must recognize higher-order relationship, to capture neighbors in all directions. Proximity graphs, such as the Relative Neighbor Graphs (RNG), use trinary relationships which capture the notion of direction and have been successfully used in a number of applications. However, the current algorithms for computing the RNG, despite widespread use, are approximate and not scalable. This paper proposes a novel type of graph, the Generalized Relative Neighborhood Graph (GRNG) for use in a pivot layer that then guides the efficient and exact construction of the RNG of a set of exemplars. It also shows how to extend this to a multi-layer hierarchy which significantly improves over the state-of-the-art methods which can only construct an approximate RNG. ",

Thus, a model trained on synthetic dataset might have poor generalization as the model learns the nuisance style variables. To that end, we propose causal invariance learning which encourages the model to learn a style-invariant representation that enhances the syn-to-real generalization. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective feature distillation method that prevents catastrophic forgetting of semantic knowledge of the real domain.

However, little attention has been given to how to quantify the dominance severity of head classes in the representation space. Motivated by this, we generalize the cosine-based classifiers to a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) mixture model, denoted as vMF classifier, which enables to quantitatively measure representation quality upon the hyper-sphere space via calculating distribution overlap coefficient. To our knowledge, this is the first work to measure representation quality of classifiers and features from the perspective of distribution overlap coefficient. On top of it, we formulate the inter-class discrepancy and class-feature consistency loss terms to alleviate the interference among the classifier weights and align features with classifier weights. Furthermore, a novel post-training calibration algorithm is devised to zero-costly boost the performance via inter-class overlap coefficients. Our method outperforms previous work with a large margin and achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-tailed image classification, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation tasks (e.g., we achieve 55.0\\% overall accuracy with ResNetXt-50 in ImageNet-LT).

    "abstract": "Recent research in multi-task learning reveals the benefit of solving related problems in a single neural network. 3D object detection and multi-object tracking (MOT) are two heavily intertwined problems predicting and associating an object instance location across time. However, most previous works in 3D MOT treat the detector as a preceding separated pipeline, disjointly taking the output of the detector as an input to the tracker. In this work, we present Minkowski Tracker, a sparse spatio-temporal R-CNN that jointly solves object detection and tracking. Inspired by region-based CNN (R-CNN), we propose to solve tracking as a second stage of the object detector R-CNN that predicts assignment probability to tracks. First, Minkowski Tracker takes 4D point clouds as input to generate a spatio-temporal Bird's-eye-view (BEV) feature map through a 4D sparse convolutional encoder network. Then, our proposed TrackAlign aggregates the track region-of-interest (ROI) features from the BEV features. Finally, Minkowski Tracker updates the track and its confidence score based on the detection-to-track match probability predicted from the ROI features. We show in large-scale experiments that the overall performance gain of our method is due to four factors: 1. The temporal reasoning of the 4D encoder improves the detection performance 2. The multi-task learning of object detection and MOT jointly enhances each other 3. The detection-to-track match score learns implicit motion model to enhance track assignment 4. The detection-to-track match score improves the quality of the track confidence score. As a result, Minkowski Tracker achieved the state-of-the-art performance on Nuscenes dataset tracking task without hand-designed motion models. ",

We develop a class of fault-tolerant finite time convergence control barrier functions (CBFs) to guarantee that a dynamical system reaches a set within finite time almost surely in the presence of malicious attacks. We use the fault-tolerant finite time convergence CBFs to guarantee the satisfaction of `reach' property. We ensure `avoid' part in each sub-task using fault-tolerant zeroing CBFs. These fault-tolerant CBFs formulate a set of linear constraints on the control input for each sub-task. We prove that if the error incurred by system state estimation is bounded by a certain threshold, then our synthesized controller fulfills each reach-avoid sub-task almost surely for any possible sensor fault and attack, and thus the GDTL specification is satisfied with probability one.

Our novel proposed framework, Adversarial Multi-Task Neural Networks (AMT), penalizes adversarial tasks, determined by NCA to be scene recognition in the Holistic Video Understanding (HVU) dataset, to improve action recognition. This upends the common assumption that the model should always be encouraged to do well on all tasks in multi-task learning. Simultaneously, AMT still retains all the benefits of multi-task learning as a generalization of existing methods and uses object recognition as an auxiliary task to aid action recognition. We introduce two challenging Scene-Invariant test splits of HVU, where the model is evaluated on action-scene co-occurrences not encountered in training. We show that our approach improves accuracy by ~3% and encourages the model to attend to action features instead of correlation-biasing scene features. ",

Generally, the mainstream code generation methods rely on a large amount of paired training data, including both the natural language description and the code. However, in some domain-specific scenarios, building such a large paired corpus for code generation is difficult because there is no directly available pairing data, and a lot of effort is required to manually write the code descriptions to construct a high-quality training dataset. Due to the limited training data, the generation model cannot be well trained and is likely to be overfitting, making the model's performance unsatisfactory for real-world use. To this end, in this paper, we propose a task augmentation method that incorporates domain knowledge into code generation models through auxiliary tasks and a Subtoken-TranX model by extending the original TranX model to support subtoken-level code generation. To verify our proposed approach, we collect a real-world code generation dataset and conduct experiments on it. Our experimental results demonstrate that the subtoken-level TranX model outperforms the original TranX model and the Transformer model on our dataset, and the exact match accuracy of Subtoken-TranX improves significantly by 12.75\\% with the help of our task augmentation method.

Specifically, we regard the field of views from all cameras around the ego vehicle as a unified view, namely surroundview, and conduct temporal stereo matching on it. The resulting geometrical correspondence between different frames from STS is utilized and combined with the monocular depth to yield final depth prediction. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes show that STS greatly boosts 3D detection ability, notably for medium and long distance objects.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a simple, accurate and computationally efficient method to apply the ordinary unscented Kalman filter developed in Euclidean space to systems whose dynamics evolve on manifolds.We use the mathematical theory called stable embedding to make a variant of unscented Kalman filter that keeps state estimates in closeproximity to the manifold while exhibiting excellent estimation performance. We confirm the performance of our devised filter by applying it to the satellite system model and comparing the performance with other unscented Kalman filters devised specifically for systems on manifolds. Our devised filter has a low estimation error, keeps the state estimates in close proximity to the manifold as expected, and consumes a minor amount of computation time. Also our devised filter is simple and easy to use because our filter directly employs the off-the-shelf standard unscented Kalman filter devised in Euclidean space without any particular manifold-structure-preserving discretization method or coordinate transformation.

    "title": "LTE4G: Long-Tail Experts for Graph Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) usually assume a balanced situation where both the class distribution and the node degree distribution are balanced. However, in real-world situations, we often encounter cases where a few classes (i.e., head class) dominate other classes (i.e., tail class) as well as in the node degree perspective, and thus naively applying existing GNNs eventually fall short of generalizing to the tail cases. Although recent studies proposed methods to handle long-tail situations on graphs, they only focus on either the class long-tailedness or the degree long-tailedness. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for training GNNs, called Long-Tail Experts for Graphs (LTE4G), which jointly considers the class long-tailedness, and the degree long-tailedness for node classification. The core idea is to assign an expert GNN model to each subset of nodes that are split in a balanced manner considering both the class and degree long-tailedness. After having trained an expert for each balanced subset, we adopt knowledge distillation to obtain two class-wise students, i.e., Head class student and Tail class student, each of which is responsible for classifying nodes in the head classes and tail classes, respectively. We demonstrate that LTE4G outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art methods in node classification evaluated on both manual and natural imbalanced graphs.

    "abstract": "The real-world facial expression recognition (FER) datasets suffer from noisy annotations due to crowd-sourcing, ambiguity in expressions, the subjectivity of annotators and inter-class similarity. However, the recent deep networks have strong capacity to memorize the noisy annotations leading to corrupted feature embedding and poor generalization. To handle noisy annotations, we propose a dynamic FER learning framework (DNFER) in which clean samples are selected based on dynamic class specific threshold during training. Specifically, DNFER is based on supervised training using selected clean samples and unsupervised consistent training using all the samples. During training, the mean posterior class probabilities of each mini-batch is used as dynamic class-specific threshold to select the clean samples for supervised training. This threshold is independent of noise rate and does not need any clean data unlike other methods. In addition, to learn from all samples, the posterior distributions between weakly-augmented image and strongly-augmented image are aligned using an unsupervised consistency loss. We demonstrate the robustness of DNFER on both synthetic as well as on real noisy annotated FER datasets like RAFDB, FERPlus, SFEW and AffectNet. ",

    "abstract": "A powerful category of data poisoning attacks modify a subset of training examples by small adversarial perturbations to change the prediction of certain test-time data. Existing defense mechanisms are not desirable to deploy in practice, as they often drastically harm the generalization performance, or are attack-specific and prohibitively slow to apply. Here, we propose a simple but highly effective approach that unlike existing methods breaks various types of poisoning attacks with the slightest drop in the generalization performance. We make the key observation that attacks exploit sharp loss regions to craft adversarial perturbations which can substantially alter examples' gradient or representations under small perturbations. To break poisoning attacks, our approach comprises two components: an optimized friendly noise that is generated to maximally perturb examples without degrading the performance, and a random varying noise component. The first component takes examples farther away from the sharp loss regions, and the second component smooths out the loss landscape. The combination of both components builds a very light-weight but extremely effective defense against the most powerful triggerless targeted and hidden-trigger backdoor poisoning attacks, including Gradient Matching, Bulls-eye Polytope, and Sleeper Agent. We show that our friendly noise is transferable to other architectures, and adaptive attacks cannot break our defense due to its random noise component. ",

Our architecture can be trained unsupervised with policy gradient descent to generate problem specific heuristics for any CSP in a purely data driven manner. The approach is based on a novel graph representation for CSPs that is both generic and compact and enables us to process every possible CSP instance with one GNN, regardless of constraint arity, relations or domain size. Unlike previous RL-based methods, we operate on a global search action space and allow our GNN to modify any number of variables in every step of the stochastic search. This enables our method to properly leverage the inherent parallelism of GNNs. We perform a thorough empirical evaluation where we learn heuristics for well known and important CSPs from random data, including graph coloring, MaxCut, 3-SAT and MAX-k-SAT. Our approach outperforms prior approaches for neural combinatorial optimization by a substantial margin. It can compete with, and even improve upon, conventional search heuristics on test instances that are several orders of magnitude larger and structurally more complex than those seen during training.

We highlight its promising potential when considering various triggers, locations and identity pairs, without the need to make any assumptions on the nature of the backdoor and its setup.

Whether neural networks are consistent with such a theory is open for debate. We propose unit tests for evaluating whether a system's behavior is consistent with several key aspects of Fodor's criteria. Using a simple visual concept learning task, we evaluate several modern neural architectures against this specification. We find that models succeed on tests of groundedness, modularlity, and reusability of concepts, but that important questions about causality remain open.

We have used Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers models for the linguistic features, openSMILE and Wav2Vec 2.0 for the audio features. The vocal interaction feature sets were designed and developed from Turn Takings. The results show that the linguistic features always give the best results (91.2% for the Request task and 70.3% for the Complaint task). The Wav2Vec 2.0 features seem more suitable for these two tasks than the ComPaRe16 features.

    "abstract": "Although pre-trained language models (PrLMs) have achieved significant success, recent studies demonstrate that PrLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. By generating adversarial examples with slight perturbations on different levels (sentence / word / character), adversarial attacks can fool PrLMs to generate incorrect predictions, which questions the robustness of PrLMs. However, we find that most existing textual adversarial examples are unnatural, which can be easily distinguished by both human and machine. Based on a general anomaly detector, we propose a novel metric (Degree of Anomaly) as a constraint to enable current adversarial attack approaches to generate more natural and imperceptible adversarial examples. Under this new constraint, the success rate of existing attacks drastically decreases, which reveals that the robustness of PrLMs is not as fragile as they claimed. In addition, we find that four types of randomization can invalidate a large portion of textual adversarial examples. Based on anomaly detector and randomization, we design a universal defense framework, which is among the first to perform textual adversarial defense without knowing the specific attack. Empirical results show that our universal defense framework achieves comparable or even higher after-attack accuracy with other specific defenses, while preserving higher original accuracy at the same time. Our work discloses the essence of textual adversarial attacks, and indicates that (1) further works of adversarial attacks should focus more on how to overcome the detection and resist the randomization, otherwise their adversarial examples would be easily detected and invalidated; and (2) compared with the unnatural and perceptible adversarial examples, it is those undetectable adversarial examples that pose real risks for PrLMs and require more attention for future robustness-enhancing strategies.

A total of 12028 tweets about the Omicron variant were studied, and the specific characteristics of tweets that were analyzed include - sentiment, language, source, type, and embedded URLs. The findings of this study are manifold. First, from sentiment analysis, it was observed that 50.5% of tweets had a neutral emotion. The other emotions - bad, good, terrible, and great were found in 15.6%, 14.0%, 12.5%, and 7.5% of the tweets, respectively. Second, the findings of language interpretation showed that 65.9% of the tweets were posted in English. It was followed by Spanish, French, Italian, and other languages. Third, the findings from source tracking showed that Twitter for Android was associated with 35.2% of tweets. It was followed by Twitter Web App, Twitter for iPhone, Twitter for iPad, and other sources. Fourth, studying the type of tweets revealed that retweets accounted for 60.8% of the tweets, it was followed by original tweets and replies that accounted for 19.8% and 19.4% of the tweets, respectively. Fifth, in terms of embedded URL analysis, the most common domain embedded in the tweets was found to be twitter.com, which was followed by biorxiv.org, nature.com, and other domains. Finally, to support similar research in this field, we have developed a Twitter dataset that comprises more than 500,000 tweets about the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant since the first detected case of this variant on November 24, 2021.

In this paper, we consider privacy leakage over a finite time horizon and investigate optimal strategies to maximize the utility of the disclosed data while limiting the finite-horizon privacy leakage. We consider a simple privacy mechanism that involves compressing the user's data before each disclosure to meet the desired constraint on future privacy.

While EVM compatibility allows existing Ethereum users and developers to migrate more easily over to the alternative layer-1, EVM incompatibility might allow the firms to build more loyal and ``sticky'' user base, and in turn a more robust ecosystem. As such, the choice to be EVM-compatible is not merely a technological decision, but also an important strategic decision. In this paper, we develop a game theoretic model to study this competitive dynamic, and find that at equilibrium, new entrants/developers tend to adopt the dominant blockchain. To avoid adoption failure, the alternative blockchains have to either (1) directly subsidize the new entrant firms or (2) offer better features, which in practice can take form in lower transaction costs, faster finality, or larger network effects. We find that it is easier for EVM-compatible blockchains to attract users through direct subsidy, while it is more efficient for EVM-incompatible blockchains to attract users through offering better features/products.

Federated learning emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their raw data. Vertical federated learning, where each party owns different features of the same set of samples and only a single party has the label, is an important and challenging topic in federated learning. Communication costs among different parties have been a major hurdle for practical vertical learning systems. In this paper, we propose a novel communication-efficient vertical federated learning algorithm named FedOnce, which requires only one-shot communication among parties. To improve model accuracy and provide privacy guarantee, FedOnce features unsupervised learning representations in the federated setting and privacy-preserving techniques based on moments accountant. The comprehensive experiments on 10 datasets demonstrate that FedOnce achieves close performance compared to state-of-the-art vertical federated learning algorithms with much lower communication costs. Meanwhile, our privacy-preserving technique significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under the same privacy budget. ",

In the last decades, cellular networks have been dramatically growth with advanced telecommunication technologies for high-speed data transmission, high cell capacity, and low latency. The main goal of those technologies is to support a wide range of new applications, such as virtual reality, metaverse, telehealth, online education, autonomous and flying vehicles, smart cities, smart grids, advanced manufacturing, and many more. The key motivation of NextG networks is to meet the high demand for those applications by improving and optimizing network functions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has a high potential to achieve these requirements by being integrated in applications throughout all layers of the network. However, the security concerns on network functions of NextG using AI-based models, i.e., model poising, have not been investigated deeply. Therefore, it needs to design efficient mitigation techniques and secure solutions for NextG networks using AI-based methods. This paper proposes a comprehensive vulnerability analysis of deep learning (DL)-based channel estimation models trained with the dataset obtained from MATLAB's 5G toolbox for adversarial attacks and defensive distillation-based mitigation methods. The adversarial attacks produce faulty results by manipulating trained DL-based models for channel estimation in NextG networks, while making models more robust against any attacks through mitigation methods. This paper also presents the performance of the proposed defensive distillation mitigation method for each adversarial attack against the channel estimation model. The results indicated that the proposed mitigation method can defend the DL-based channel estimation models against adversarial attacks in NextG networks. ",

To this end, we start by putting forth a novel distributed event-triggering transmission strategy based on periodic sampling, under which a model-based stability criterion for the closed-loop network system is derived, by leveraging a discrete-time looped-functional approach. Marrying the model-based criterion with a data-driven system representation recently developed in the literature, a purely data-driven stability criterion expressed in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) is established. Meanwhile, the data-driven stability criterion suggests a means for co-designing the event-triggering coefficient matrix and the feedback control gain matrix using only some offline collected state-input data. Finally, numerical results corroborate the efficacy of the proposed distributed data-driven ETS in cutting off data transmissions and the co-design procedure. ",

    "abstract": "Learning a Bayesian network is an NP-hard problem and with an increase in the number of nodes, classical algorithms for learning the structure of Bayesian networks become inefficient. In recent years, some methods and algorithms for learning Bayesian networks with a high number of nodes (more than 50) were developed. But these solutions have their disadvantages, for instance, they only operate one type of data (discrete or continuous) or their algorithm has been created to meet a specific nature of data (medical, social, etc.). The article presents a BigBraveBN algorithm for learning large Bayesian Networks with a high number of nodes (over 100). The algorithm utilizes the Brave coefficient that measures the mutual occurrence of instances in several groups. To form these groups, we use the method of nearest neighbours based on the Mutual information (MI) measure. In the experimental part of the article, we compare the performance of BigBraveBN to other existing solutions on multiple data sets both discrete and continuous. The experimental part also represents tests on real data. The aforementioned experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the BigBraveBN algorithm in structure learning of Bayesian Networks. ",

However, these aggregations are lossy, i.e. they do not capture the semantics of the original triples, such as information contained in the predicates. To combat these shortcomings, current methods learn triple embeddings from scratch without utilizing entity and predicate embeddings from pre-trained models. In this paper, we design a novel fine-tuning approach for learning triple embeddings by creating weak supervision signals from pre-trained knowledge graph embeddings. We develop a method for automatically sampling triples from a knowledge graph and estimating their pairwise similarities from pre-trained embedding models. These pairwise similarity scores are then fed to a Siamese-like neural architecture to fine-tune triple representations. We evaluate the proposed method on two widely studied knowledge graphs and show consistent improvement over other state-of-the-art triple embedding methods on triple classification and triple clustering tasks.

These shapes support the display of information such as labels or encode various data with size or color. However, they can create overlaps between nodes which hinder the exploration process by hiding parts of the information. It is therefore of utmost importance to remove these overlaps to improve graph visualization readability. If not handled by the layout process, Overlap Removal (OR) algorithms have been proposed as layout post-processing. As graph layouts usually convey information about their topology, it is important that OR algorithms preserve them as much as possible. We propose a novel algorithm that models OR as a joint stress and scaling optimization problem, and leverages efficient stochastic gradient descent. This approach is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, and several quality metrics demonstrate its efficiency to quickly remove overlaps while retaining the initial layout structures. ",

In this work, inspired by homomorphic representations of indexed languages, we identify a subclass of 2-nested words, which we call 2-wave words. This class strictly extends the class of nested words, while preserving its main properties. More precisely, we prove closure under determinization of the corresponding automaton model, we provide a logical characterization of the recognized languages, and show that the corresponding graphs have bounded treewidth.

This broadband diffractive processor is composed of N_w wavelength channels, each of which is uniquely assigned to a distinct target transformation. A large set of arbitrarily-selected linear transformations can be individually performed through the same diffractive network at different illumination wavelengths, either simultaneously or sequentially (wavelength scanning). We demonstrate that such a broadband diffractive network, regardless of its material dispersion, can successfully approximate N_w unique complex-valued linear transforms with a negligible error when the number of diffractive neurons (N) in its design matches or exceeds 2 x N_w x N_i x N_o. We further report that the spectral multiplexing capability (N_w) can be increased by increasing N; our numerical analyses confirm these conclusions for N_w > 180, which can be further increased to e.g., ~2000 depending on the upper bound of the approximation error. Massively parallel, wavelength-multiplexed diffractive networks will be useful for designing high-throughput intelligent machine vision systems and hyperspectral processors that can perform statistical inference and analyze objects/scenes with unique spectral properties.

However, current work typically models graph dynamics with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), making them suffer seriously from computation and memory overheads on large temporal graphs. So far, scalability of dynamic graph representation learning on large temporal graphs remains one of the major challenges. In this paper, we present a scalable framework, namely SpikeNet, to efficiently capture the temporal and structural patterns of temporal graphs. We explore a new direction in that we can capture the evolving dynamics of temporal graphs with spiking neural networks (SNNs) instead of RNNs. As a low-power alternative to RNNs, SNNs explicitly model graph dynamics as spike trains of neuron populations and enable spike-based propagation in an efficient way. Experiments on three large real-world temporal graph datasets demonstrate that SpikeNet outperforms strong baselines on the temporal node classification task with lower computational costs. Particularly, SpikeNet generalizes to a large temporal graph (2M nodes and 13M edges) with significantly fewer parameters and computation overheads.

Prevailing computer-aided skin cancer classification systems employ deep learning approaches. However, recent studies reveal their extreme vulnerability to adversarial attacks -- often imperceptible perturbations to significantly reduce performances of skin cancer diagnosis models. To mitigate these threats, this work presents a simple, effective and resource-efficient defense framework by reverse engineering adversarial perturbations in skin cancer images. Specifically, a multiscale image pyramid is first established to better preserve discriminative structures in medical imaging domain. To neutralize adversarial effects, skin images at different scales are then progressively diffused by injecting isotropic Gaussian noises to move the adversarial examples to the clean image manifold. Crucially, to further reverse adversarial noises and suppress redundant injected noises, a novel multiscale denoising mechanism is carefully designed that aggregates image information from neighboring scales. We evaluated the defensive effectiveness of our method on ISIC 2019, a largest skin cancer multiclass classification dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully reverse adversarial perturbations from different attacks and significantly outperform some state-of-the-art methods in defending skin cancer diagnosis models.

The unceasing growth of knowledge in real life raises the necessity to enable the inductive reasoning ability on expanding KGs. Existing inductive work assumes that new entities all emerge once in a batch, which oversimplifies the real scenario that new entities continually appear. This study dives into a more realistic and challenging setting where new entities emerge in multiple batches. We propose a walk-based inductive reasoning model to tackle the new setting. Specifically, a graph convolutional network with adaptive relation aggregation is designed to encode and update entities using their neighboring relations. To capture the varying neighbor importance, we employ a query-aware feedback attention mechanism during the aggregation. Furthermore, to alleviate the sparse link problem of new entities, we propose a link augmentation strategy to add trustworthy facts into KGs. We construct three new datasets for simulating this multi-batch emergence scenario. The experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art embedding-based, walk-based and rule-based models on inductive KG reasoning. ",

In this domain, low-rank approximation is a promising method, but existing solutions considered a restricted number of design choices and failed to efficiently explore the design space, which lead to severe accuracy degradation and limited compression ratio achieved. To address the above limitations, this work proposes the SVD-NAS framework that couples the domains of low-rank approximation and neural architecture search. SVD-NAS generalises and expands the design choices of previous works by introducing the Low-Rank architecture space, LR-space, which is a more fine-grained design space of low-rank approximation. Afterwards, this work proposes a gradient-descent-based search for efficiently traversing the LR-space. This finer and more thorough exploration of the possible design choices results in improved accuracy as well as reduction in parameters, FLOPS, and latency of a CNN model. Results demonstrate that the SVD-NAS achieves 2.06-12.85pp higher accuracy on ImageNet than state-of-the-art methods under the data-limited problem setting.

Generally, an accurately implemented onboard model determines how well the system nonlinearities can be canceled. Thus, more accurate model results in better cancellation, leading to the higher performance of the controller. In this paper, a new control system is presented that combines nonlinear dynamic inversion with a piecewise multi-linear representation based control allocation. The piecewise multi-linear representation is developed through a new generalization of Kronecker product for block matrices, combined with the canonical piecewise linear representation of nonlinear functions. Analytical expressions for the Jacobian of the piecewise multi-linear model are also presented. Proposed formulation gives an exact representation of piecewise multi-linear aerodynamic data and thus is capable of accurately modeling nonlinear aerodynamics over the entire flight envelope of an aircraft. Resulting nonlinear controller is applied to control of a tailless flying wing aircraft with ten independently operating control surfaces. The simulation results for two innovative control surface configurations indicate that perfect control allocation performance can be achieved, leading to better tracking performance compared with ordinary polynomial-based control allocation.

After an event that has damaged an arbitrary subset of the edges, the network operator must find a spanning tree of the network using non-damaged edges by making as few checks as possible. Motivated by such questions, we study the problem of finding a spanning tree in a network, when we only have access to noisy queries of the form \"Does edge e exist?\". We design efficient algorithms, even when edges fail adversarially, for all possible error regimes; 2-sided error (where any answer might be erroneous), false positives (where \"no\" answers are always correct) and false negatives (where \"yes\" answers are always correct). In the first two regimes we provide efficient algorithms and give matching lower bounds for general graphs. In the False Negative case we design efficient algorithms for large interesting families of graphs (e.g. bounded treewidth, sparse). Using the previous results, we provide tight algorithms for the practically useful family of planar graphs in all error regimes. ",

In this work, we draw upon the idea of formal contracting from economics to overcome diverging incentives between agents in MARL. We propose an augmentation to a Markov game where agents voluntarily agree to binding state-dependent transfers of reward, under pre-specified conditions. Our contributions are theoretical and empirical. First, we show that this augmentation makes all subgame-perfect equilibria of all fully observed Markov games exhibit socially optimal behavior, given a sufficiently rich space of contracts. Next, we complement our game-theoretic analysis by showing that state-of-the-art RL algorithms learn socially optimal policies given our augmentation.

    "abstract": "The introduction of computational techniques to analyze chemical data has given rise to the analytical study of biological systems, known as \"bioinformatics\". One facet of bioinformatics is using machine learning (ML) technology to detect multivariable trends in various cases. Amongst the most pressing cases is predicting blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. The development of new drugs to treat central nervous system disorders presents unique challenges due to poor penetration efficacy across the blood-brain barrier. In this research, we aim to mitigate this problem through an ML model that analyzes chemical features. To do so: (i) An overview into the relevant biological systems and processes as well as the use case is given. (ii) Second, an in-depth literature review of existing computational techniques for detecting BBB permeability is undertaken. From there, an aspect unexplored across current techniques is identified and a solution is proposed. (iii) Lastly, a two-part in silico model to quantify likelihood of permeability of drugs with defined features across the BBB through passive diffusion is developed, tested, and reflected on. Testing and validation with the dataset determined the predictive logBB model's mean squared error to be around 0.112 units and the neuroinflammation model's mean squared error to be approximately 0.3 units, outperforming all relevant studies found.

    "abstract": "Recently, there have been significant developments in neural networks; thus, neural networks have been frequently used in the physics literature. This work estimates the masses of exotic hadrons, doubly charmed and bottomed baryons from the meson and baryon masses using neural networks. Subsequently, the number of data has been increased using the artificial data augmentation technique proposed recently. We have observed that the neural network's predictive ability increases using augmented data. This study has shown that data augmentation techniques play an essential role in improving neural network predictions; moreover, neural networks can make reasonable predictions for exotic hadrons, doubly charmed, and doubly bottomed baryons. The results are also comparable to Gaussian Process and Constituent Quark Model. ",

We propose here a framework for ab initio derivation of sequence motifs and linear formula using a new approach based on the interpretable neural network model called contextual regression model.

We uncovered a list of 300 motifs with important regulatory roles on gene expression and showed that they also had significant contributions to cell-type specific gene expression in 154 diverse cell types.

    "abstract": "Predicting disruptions across different tokamaks is a great obstacle to overcome. Future tokamaks can hardly tolerate disruptions at high performance discharge. Few disruption discharges at high performance can hardly compose an abundant training set, which makes it difficult for current data-driven methods to obtain an acceptable result. A machine learning method capable of transferring a disruption prediction model trained on one tokamak to another is required to solve the problem. The key is a disruption prediction model containing a feature extractor that is able to extract common disruption precursor traces in tokamak diagnostic data, and a transferable disruption classifier. Based on the concerns above, the paper first presents a deep fusion feature extractor designed specifically for extracting disruption precursor features from common diagnostics on tokamaks according to currently known precursors of disruption, providing a promising foundation for transferable models. The fusion feature extractor is proved by comparing with manual feature extraction on J-TEXT. Based on the feature extractor trained on J-TEXT, the disruption prediction model was transferred to EAST data with mere 20 discharges from EAST experiment. The performance is comparable with a model trained with 1896 discharges from EAST. From the comparison among other model training scenarios, transfer learning showed its potential in predicting disruptions across different tokamaks. ",

    "abstract": "As graph data becomes more ubiquitous, the need for robust inferential graph algorithms to operate in these complex data domains is crucial. In many cases of interest, inference is further complicated by the presence of adversarial data contamination. The effect of the adversary is frequently to change the data distribution in ways that negatively affect statistical and algorithmic performance. We study this phenomenon in the context of vertex nomination, a semi-supervised information retrieval task for network data. Here, a common suite of methods relies on spectral graph embeddings, which have been shown to provide both good algorithmic performance and flexible settings in which regularization techniques can be implemented to help mitigate the effect of an adversary. Many current regularization methods rely on direct network trimming to effectively excise the adversarial contamination, although this direct trimming often gives rise to complicated dependency structures in the resulting graph. We propose a new trimming method that operates in model space which can address both block structure contamination and white noise contamination (contamination whose distribution is unknown). This model trimming is more amenable to theoretical analysis while also demonstrating superior performance in a number of simulations, compared to direct trimming. ",

The estimates rely on detailed expressions for subgradients and local Lipschitz moduli of min-value functions in nonconvex robust optimization and require only the solution of the nominal problem. The theoretical results are illustrated by examples from military operations research involving mixed-integer optimization models. Across 54 cases examined, the median error in estimating the increase in minimum value is 12%. Therefore, the derived expressions for subgradients and local Lipschitz moduli may accurately inform analysts about the possibility of obtaining cost-effective, parameter-robust decisions in nonconvex optimization.

We propose FastCPH, a new method that runs in linear time and supports both the standard Breslow and Efron methods for tied events.

    "abstract": "Dental age is one of the most reliable methods to identify an individual's age. By using dental panoramic radiography (DPR) images, physicians and pathologists in forensic sciences try to establish the chronological age of individuals with no valid legal records or registered patients. The current methods in practice demand intensive labor, time, and qualified experts. The development of deep learning algorithms in the field of medical image processing has improved the sensitivity of predicting truth values while reducing the processing speed of imaging time. This study proposed an automated approach to estimate the forensic ages of individuals ranging in age from 8 to 68 using 1,332 DPR images. Initially, experimental analyses were performed with the transfer learning-based models, including InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetB4, MobileNetV2, VGG16, and ResNet50V2; and accordingly, the best-performing model, InceptionV3, was modified, and a new neural network model was developed. Reducing the number of the parameters already available in the developed model architecture resulted in a faster and more accurate dental age estimation. The performance metrics of the results attained were as follows: mean absolute error (MAE) was 3.13, root mean square error (RMSE) was 4.77, and correlation coefficient R$^2$ was 87%. It is conceivable to propose the new model as potentially dependable and practical ancillary equipment in forensic sciences and dental medicine. ",

    "abstract": "Bandit algorithms are widely used in sequential decision problems to maximize the cumulative reward. One potential application is mobile health, where the goal is to promote the user's health through personalized interventions based on user specific information acquired through wearable devices. Important considerations include the type of, and frequency with which data is collected (e.g. GPS, or continuous monitoring), as such factors can severely impact app performance and users' adherence. In order to balance the need to collect data that is useful with the constraint of impacting app performance, one needs to be able to assess the usefulness of variables. Bandit feedback data are sequentially correlated, so traditional testing procedures developed for independent data cannot apply. Recently, a statistical testing procedure was developed for the actor-critic bandit algorithm. An actor-critic algorithm maintains two separate models, one for the actor, the action selection policy, and the other for the critic, the reward model. The performance of the algorithm as well as the validity of the test are guaranteed only when the critic model is correctly specified. However, misspecification is frequent in practice due to incorrect functional form or missing covariates. In this work, we propose a modified actor-critic algorithm which is robust to critic misspecification and derive a novel testing procedure for the actor parameters in this case. ",

To evaluate the quality of the AI algorithms and obtain a trustworthy assessment on the quality of the algorithms, we establish a design-of-experiment framework to construct an efficient space-filling design in a high-dimensional constraint space and develop an effective surrogate model using additive Gaussian process to enable the emulation of the quality of AI algorithms. Both theoretical and numerical studies are conducted to justify the merits of the proposed framework.

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of constructing a canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition for a tensor network, rather than a single tensor. We illustrate how it is possible to reduce the complexity of constructing an approximate CP representation of the network by leveraging its structure in the course of the CP factor optimization. The utility of this technique is demonstrated for the order-4 Coulomb interaction tensor approximated by 2 order-3 tensors via an approximate generalized square-root (SQ) factorization, such as density fitting or (pivoted) Cholesky. The complexity of constructing a 4-way CP decomposition is reduced from $\\mathcal{O}(n^4 R_\\text{CP})$ (for the non-approximated Coulomb tensor) to $\\mathcal{O}(n^3 R_\\text{CP})$ for the SQ-factorized tensor, where $n$ and $R_\\text{CP}$ are the basis and CP ranks, respectively. This reduces the cost of constructing the CP approximation of 2-body interaction tensors of relevance to accurate many-body electronic structure by up to 2 orders of magnitude for systems with up to 36 atoms studied here. The full 4-way CP approximation of the Coulomb interaction tensor is shown to be more accurate than the known approaches utilizing CP-decomposed SQ factors (also obtained at the $\\mathcal{O}(n^3 R_\\text{CP})$ cost), such as the algebraic pseudospectral and tensor hypercontraction approaches. The CP decomposed SQ factors can also serve as a robust initial guess for the 4-way CP factors. ",

The effect prediction for marketing campaigns in a real industrial scenario is very complex and challenging due to the fact that prior knowledge is often learned from observation data, without any intervention for the marketing campaign. Furthermore, each subject is always under the interference of several marketing campaigns simultaneously. Therefore, we cannot easily parse and evaluate the effect of a single marketing campaign. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no effective methodologies to solve such a problem, i.e., modeling an individual-level prediction task based on a hierarchical structure with multiple intertwined events. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the underlying parse tree-like structure involved in the effect prediction task and we further establish a Hierarchical Capsule Prediction Network (HapNet) for predicting the effects of marketing campaigns. Extensive results based on both the synthetic data and real data demonstrate the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art methods and show remarkable practicability in real industrial applications.

The agents aim to minimize the worst-case expected cost computed over a Wasserstein ambiguity set that is centered at the empirical distribution. The samples of the uncertainty are distributed across the agents. Our approach consists of reformulating the problem as a semi-infinite program and then designing a distributed algorithm that solves a generic semi-infinite problem that has the same information structure as the reformulated problem. In particular, the decision variables consist of both local ones that agents are free to optimize over and global ones where they need to agree on. Our distributed algorithm is an iterative procedure that combines the notions of distributed ADMM and the cutting-surface method. We show that the iterates converge asymptotically to a solution of the distributionally robust problem to any pre-specified accuracy. Simulations illustrate our results. ",
