    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication is becoming critical for the enhanced reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the uncertainties in the road-traffic and AVs' wireless connections can severely impair timely decision-making. It is thus critical to simultaneously optimize the AVs' network selection and driving policies in order to minimize road collisions while maximizing the communication data rates. In this paper, we develop a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to characterize efficient network selection and autonomous driving policies in a multi-band vehicular network (VNet) operating on conventional sub-6GHz spectrum and Terahertz (THz) frequencies. The proposed framework is designed to (i) maximize the traffic flow and minimize collisions by controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics (i.e., speed and acceleration) from autonomous driving perspective, and (ii) maximize the data rates and minimize handoffs by jointly controlling the vehicle's motion dynamics and network selection from telecommunication perspective. We cast this problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop a deep Q-learning based solution to optimize the actions such as acceleration, deceleration, lane-changes, and AV-base station assignments for a given AV's state. The AV's state is defined based on the velocities and communication channel states of AVs. Numerical results demonstrate interesting insights related to the inter-dependency of vehicle's motion dynamics, handoffs, and the communication data rate. The proposed policies enable AVs to adopt safe driving behaviors with improved connectivity. ",

    "abstract": "With the development of hardware and algorithms, ASR(Automatic Speech Recognition) systems evolve a lot. As The models get simpler, the difficulty of development and deployment become easier, ASR systems are getting closer to our life. On the one hand, we often use APPs or APIs of ASR to generate subtitles and record meetings. On the other hand, smart speaker and self-driving car rely on ASR systems to control AIoT devices. In past few years, there are a lot of works on adversarial examples attacks against ASR systems. By adding a small perturbation to the waveforms, the recognition results make a big difference. In this paper, we describe the development of ASR system, different assumptions of attacks, and how to evaluate these attacks. Next, we introduce the current works on adversarial examples attacks from two attack assumptions: white-box attack and black-box attack. Different from other surveys, we pay more attention to which layer they perturb waveforms in ASR system, the relationship between these attacks, and their implementation methods. We focus on the effect of their works. ",

However, within the field of web information retrieval, there is a stark contrast in the lack of similarly flexible and powerful pre-trained models that can properly parse webpages. Consequently, we believe that common machine learning tasks like content extraction and information mining from webpages have low-hanging gains that yet remain untapped. We aim to close the gap by introducing an agnostic deep graph neural network feature extractor that can ingest webpage structures, pre-train self-supervised on massive unlabeled data, and fine-tune to arbitrary tasks on webpages effectually. Finally, we show that our pre-trained model achieves state-of-the-art results using multiple datasets on two very different benchmarks: webpage boilerplate removal and genre classification, thus lending support to its potential application in diverse downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Autonomous Driving (AD) related features represent important elements for the next generation of mobile robots and autonomous vehicles focused on increasingly intelligent, autonomous, and interconnected systems. The applications involving the use of these features must provide, by definition, real-time decisions, and this property is key to avoid catastrophic accidents. Moreover, all the decision processes must require low power consumption, to increase the lifetime and autonomy of battery-driven systems. These challenges can be addressed through efficient implementations of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on Neuromorphic Chips and the use of event-based cameras instead of traditional frame-based cameras. In this paper, we present a new SNN-based approach, called LaneSNN, for detecting the lanes marked on the streets using the event-based camera input. We develop four novel SNN models characterized by low complexity and fast response, and train them using an offline supervised learning rule. Afterward, we implement and map the learned SNNs models onto the Intel Loihi Neuromorphic Research Chip. For the loss function, we develop a novel method based on the linear composition of Weighted binary Cross Entropy (WCE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) measures. Our experimental results show a maximum Intersection over Union (IoU) measure of about 0.62 and very low power consumption of about 1 W. The best IoU is achieved with an SNN implementation that occupies only 36 neurocores on the Loihi processor while providing a low latency of less than 8 ms to recognize an image, thereby enabling real-time performance. The IoU measures provided by our networks are comparable with the state-of-the-art, but at a much low power consumption of 1 W. ",

Given the input, the goal is to determine a path from source to destination, which maximizes the \"score\" while constraining the total \"cost\" of the path to be within the given budget value. CPO problem has applications in urban navigation. However, the CPO problem is computationally challenging as it can be reduced to an instance of the arc orienteering problem, which is known to be NP-hard. The current state-of-the-art algorithms for this problem are essentially serial in nature and cannot take full advantage (i.e., achieve good load balance) of the increasingly available multi-core systems to solve a CPO query. Our proposed parallel algorithm (with its intelligent task-assignment scheme) achieves both superior solution quality and very low execution times (via good load balancing). Moreover, our approach is also able to demonstrate an almost linear speed-up with an increase in the number of cores. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has attracted growing interest for enabling privacy-preserving machine learning on data stored at multiple users while avoiding moving the data off-device. However, while data never leaves users' devices, privacy still cannot be guaranteed since significant computations on users' training data are shared in the form of trained local models. These local models have recently been shown to pose a substantial privacy threat through different privacy attacks such as model inversion attacks. As a remedy, Secure Aggregation (SA) has been developed as a framework to preserve privacy in FL, by guaranteeing the server can only learn the global aggregated model update but not the individual model updates. While SA ensures no additional information is leaked about the individual model update beyond the aggregated model update, there are no formal guarantees on how much privacy FL with SA can actually offer; as information about the individual dataset can still potentially leak through the aggregated model computed at the server. In this work, we perform a first analysis of the formal privacy guarantees for FL with SA. Specifically, we use Mutual Information (MI) as a quantification metric and derive upper bounds on how much information about each user's dataset can leak through the aggregated model update. When using the FedSGD aggregation algorithm, our theoretical bounds show that the amount of privacy leakage reduces linearly with the number of users participating in FL with SA. To validate our theoretical bounds, we use an MI Neural Estimator to empirically evaluate the privacy leakage under different FL setups on both the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Our experiments verify our theoretical bounds for FedSGD, which show a reduction in privacy leakage as the number of users and local batch size grow, and an increase in privacy leakage with the number of training rounds.

Albeit the advancement and promising results shown by machine learning techniques, attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities by generating adversarial samples. Adversarial samples are generated by intelligently crafting and adding perturbations to the input samples. There exists majority of the software based adversarial attacks and defenses. To defend against the adversaries, the existing malware detection based on machine learning and grayscale images needs a preprocessing for the adversarial data. This can cause an additional overhead and can prolong the real-time malware detection. So, as an alternative to this, we explore RRAM (Resistive Random Access Memory) based defense against adversaries. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to address the above mentioned critical system security issues. The above mentioned challenges are addressed by demonstrating proposed techniques to design a secure and robust cognitive system. First, a novel technique to detect stealthy malware is proposed. The technique uses malware binary images and then extract different features from the same and then employ different ML-classifiers on the dataset thus obtained. Results demonstrate that this technique is successful in differentiating classes of malware based on the features extracted. Secondly, I demonstrate the effects of adversarial attacks on a reconfigurable RRAM-neuromorphic architecture with different learning algorithms and device characteristics. I also propose an integrated solution for mitigating the effects of the adversarial attack using the reconfigurable RRAM architecture. ",

Automating defect detection would reduce documentation efforts that are necessary to decrease the risk of defects delaying construction projects. Since concrete is a widely used construction material, this work focuses on detecting honeycombs, a substantial defect in concrete structures that may even affect structural integrity. First, images were compared that were either scraped from the web or obtained from actual practice. The results demonstrate that web images represent just a selection of honeycombs and do not capture the complete variance. Second, Mask R-CNN and EfficientNet-B0 were trained for honeycomb detection to evaluate instance segmentation and patch-based classification, respectively achieving 47.7% precision and 34.2% recall as well as 68.5% precision and 55.7% recall. Although the performance of those models is not sufficient for completely automated defect detection, the models could be used for active learning integrated into defect documentation systems. In conclusion, CNNs can assist detecting honeycombs in concrete. ",

    "abstract": "Although there are many improvements to WENO3-Z that target the achievement of optimal order in the occurrence of the first-order critical point (CP1), they mainly address resolution performance, while the robustness of schemes is of less concern and lacks understanding accordingly. In light of our analysis considering the occurrence of critical points within grid intervals, we theoretically prove that it is impossible for a scale-independent scheme that has the stencil of WENO3-Z to fulfill the above order achievement, and current scale-dependent improvements barely fulfill the job when CP1 occurs at the middle of the grid cell. In order to achieve scale-independent improvements, we devise new smoothness indicators that increase the error order from 2 to 4 when CP1 occurs and perform more stably. Meanwhile, we construct a new global smoothness indicator that increases the error order from 4 to 5 similarly, through which new nonlinear weights with regard to WENO3-Z are derived and new scale-independents improvements, namely WENO-ZES2 and -ZES3, are acquired. Through 1D scalar and Euler tests, as well as 2D computations, in comparison with typical scale-dependent improvement, the following performances of the proposed schemes are demonstrated: The schemes can achieve third-order accuracy at CP1 no matter its location in the stencil, indicate high resolution in resolving flow subtleties, and manifest strong robustness in hypersonic simulations (e.g., the accomplishment of computations on hypersonic half-cylinder flow with Mach numbers reaching 16 and 19, respectively, as well as essentially non-oscillatory solutions of inviscid sharp double cone flow at M=9.59), which contrasts the comparative WENO3-Z improvement.

Adversaries hold an asymmetric advantage over the CSOC, as the number of deficiencies in these systems is increasing at a significantly higher rate compared to the expansion rate of the security teams to mitigate them in a resource-constrained environment. The current approaches are deterministic and one-time decision-making methods, which do not consider future uncertainties when prioritizing and selecting vulnerabilities for mitigation. These approaches are also constrained by the sub-optimal distribution of resources, providing no flexibility to adjust their response to fluctuations in vulnerability arrivals. We propose a novel framework, Deep VULMAN, consisting of a deep reinforcement learning agent and an integer programming method to fill this gap in the cyber vulnerability management process. Our sequential decision-making framework, first, determines the near-optimal amount of resources to be allocated for mitigation under uncertainty for a given system state and then determines the optimal set of prioritized vulnerability instances for mitigation.

Our proposed formulation accounts for the temporal evolution and the partial observability of the channel states. This allows us to consider future rewards when performing HO decisions, and hence obtain a robust HO policy. To alleviate the high complexity of solving our POMDP, we follow a divide-and-conquer approach by breaking down the POMDP formulation into sub-problems, each solved individually. Then, the policy and the candidate cluster of access points for the best solved sub-problem is used to perform HOs within a specific time horizon. We control the number of HOs by determining when to use the HO policy. Our simulation results show that our proposed solution reduces HOs by 47% compared to time-triggered LSF-based HOs and by 70% compared to data rate threshold-triggered LSF-based HOs. This amount can be further reduced through increasing the time horizon of the POMDP. ",

However, this is a challenging problem due to the two different domain characteristics, and the lack of NIR face dataset. In order to reduce domain discrepancy while using the existing face recognition models, we propose a 'Relation Module' which can simply add-on to any face recognition models. The local features extracted from face image contain information of each component of the face. Based on two different domain characteristics, to use the relationships between local features is more domain-invariant than to use it as it is. In addition to these relationships, positional information such as distance from lips to chin or eye to eye, also provides domain-invariant information. In our Relation Module, Relation Layer implicitly captures relationships, and Coordinates Layer models the positional information. Also, our proposed Triplet loss with conditional margin reduces intra-class variation in training, and resulting in additional performance improvements. Different from the general face recognition models, our add-on module does not need to pre-train with the large scale dataset. The proposed module fine-tuned only with CASIA NIR-VIS 2.0 database.

A large enough and perceptible perturbation is added to an image such that a model maintains its original decision, whereas a human will most likely make a mistake if forced to decide (or opt not to decide at all). Existing targeted attacks can be reformulated to synthesize such adversarial examples. Our proposed attack, dubbed NKE, is similar in essence to the fooling images, but is more efficient since it uses gradient descent instead of evolutionary algorithms. It also offers a new and unified perspective into the problem of adversarial vulnerability. Experimental results over MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that our attack is quite efficient in fooling deep neural networks. Code is available at https://github.com/aliborji/NKE. ",

    "abstract": "Identifying pills given their captured images under various conditions and backgrounds has been becoming more and more essential. Several efforts have been devoted to utilizing the deep learning-based approach to tackle the pill recognition problem in the literature. However, due to the high similarity between pills' appearance, misrecognition often occurs, leaving pill recognition a challenge. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a novel approach named PIKA that leverages external knowledge to enhance pill recognition accuracy. Specifically, we address a practical scenario (which we call contextual pill recognition), aiming to identify pills in a picture of a patient's pill intake. Firstly, we propose a novel method for modeling the implicit association between pills in the presence of an external data source, in this case, prescriptions. Secondly, we present a walk-based graph embedding model that transforms from the graph space to vector space and extracts condensed relational features of the pills. Thirdly, a final framework is provided that leverages both image-based visual and graph-based relational features to accomplish the pill identification task. Within this framework, the visual representation of each pill is mapped to the graph embedding space, which is then used to execute attention over the graph representation, resulting in a semantically-rich context vector that aids in the final classification. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use external prescription data to establish associations between medicines and to classify them using this aiding information. The architecture of PIKA is lightweight and has the flexibility to incorporate into any recognition backbones. The experimental results show that by leveraging the external knowledge graph, PIKA can improve the recognition accuracy from 4.8% to 34.1% in terms of F1-score, compared to baselines. ",

These apps need to be categorized and reviewed following a proper framework that ensures their quality. This study aims to present an approach to evaluating plant disease detection mobile apps, this includes providing ratings of distinct features of the apps and insights into the exploitation of artificial intelligence used in plant disease detection. For this purpose, plant disease detection apps were searched in three prominent app stores using a set of keywords. A total of 606 apps were found and from them 17 relevant apps were identified based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The selected apps were reviewed by three raters using our devised app rating scale. User comments from the app stores are collected and analyzed to understand their expectations and views. Following the rating procedure, most apps earned acceptable ratings in software quality characteristics such as aesthetics, usability, and performance, but gained poor ratings in AI-based advanced functionality, which is the key aspect of this study. However, most of the apps cannot be used as a complete solution to plant disease detection, diagnosis, and treatment. Only one app, Plantix - your crop doctor, could successfully identify plants from images, detect diseases, maintain a rich plant database, and suggest potential treatments for the disease presented. It also provides a community where plant lovers can communicate with each other to gain additional benefits. In general, all existing apps need to improve functionalities, user experience, and software quality. Therefore, a set of design considerations has been proposed for future app improvements. ",

    "abstract": "High dynamic range (HDR) imaging is a fundamental problem in image processing, which aims to generate well-exposed images, even in the presence of varying illumination in the scenes. In recent years, multi-exposure fusion methods have achieved remarkable results, which merge multiple low dynamic range (LDR) images, captured with different exposures, to generate corresponding HDR images. However, synthesizing HDR images in dynamic scenes is still challenging and in high demand. There are two challenges in producing HDR images: 1). Object motion between LDR images can easily cause undesirable ghosting artifacts in the generated results. 2). Under and overexposed regions often contain distorted image content, because of insufficient compensation for these regions in the merging stage. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale sampling and aggregation network for HDR imaging in dynamic scenes. To effectively alleviate the problems caused by small and large motions, our method implicitly aligns LDR images by sampling and aggregating high-correspondence features in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, we propose a densely connected network based on discrete wavelet transform for performance improvement, which decomposes the input into several non-overlapping frequency subbands and adaptively performs compensation in the wavelet domain. Experiments show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performances under diverse scenes, compared to other promising HDR imaging methods. In addition, the HDR images generated by our method contain cleaner and more detailed content, with fewer distortions, leading to better visual quality. ",

These methods solely consider the distortion quality and ignore crucial requirements for online applications, e.g., low latency and low model complexity. In this paper, we focus on online video transmission, in which VSR algorithms are required to generate high-resolution video sequences frame by frame in real time. To address such challenges, we propose an extremely low-latency VSR algorithm based on a novel kernel knowledge transfer method, named convolutional kernel bypass graft (CKBG). First, we design a lightweight network structure that does not require future frames as inputs and saves extra time costs for caching these frames. Then, our proposed CKBG method enhances this lightweight base model by bypassing the original network with ``kernel grafts'', which are extra convolutional kernels containing the prior knowledge of external pretrained image SR models. In the testing phase, we further accelerate the grafted multi-branch network by converting it into a simple single-path structure. Experiment results show that our proposed method can process online video sequences up to 110 FPS, with very low model complexity and competitive SR performance. ",

Classical model-based solutions to composite hypothesis testing are sensitive to imperfect models and are often computationally expensive. In contrast, data-driven machine learning is often more robust and yields classifiers with fixed computational complexity. Learned detectors usually do not have a CFAR as required in many applications. To close this gap, we introduce CFARnet where the loss function is penalized to promote similar distributions of the detector under any null hypothesis scenario. Asymptotic analysis in the case of linear models with general Gaussian noise reveals that the classical generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is actually a minimizer of the CFAR constrained Bayes risk. Experiments in both synthetic data and real hyper-spectral images show that CFARnet leads to near CFAR detectors with similar accuracy as their competitors. ",

    "abstract": "The paper presents a new efficient and robust method for rare event probability estimation for computational models of an engineering product or a process returning categorical information only, for example, either success or failure. For such models, most of the methods designed for the estimation of failure probability, which use the numerical value of the outcome to compute gradients or to estimate the proximity to the failure surface, cannot be applied. Even if the performance function provides more than just binary output, the state of the system may be a non-smooth or even a discontinuous function defined in the domain of continuous input variables. In these cases, the classical gradient-based methods usually fail. We propose a simple yet efficient algorithm, which performs a sequential adaptive selection of points from the input domain of random variables to extend and refine a simple distance-based surrogate model. Two different tasks can be accomplished at any stage of sequential sampling: (i) estimation of the failure probability, and (ii) selection of the best possible candidate for the subsequent model evaluation if further improvement is necessary. The proposed criterion for selecting the next point for model evaluation maximizes the expected probability classified by using the candidate. Therefore, the perfect balance between global exploration and local exploitation is maintained automatically. The method can estimate the probabilities of multiple failure types. Moreover, when the numerical value of model evaluation can be used to build a smooth surrogate, the algorithm can accommodate this information to increase the accuracy of the estimated probabilities. Lastly, we define a new simple yet general geometrical measure of the global sensitivity of the rare-event probability to individual variables, which is obtained as a by-product of the proposed algorithm.

These models are often deployed on the server-side and receive user data in an information-rich representation to solve a specific task, such as image classification. Since images can contain sensitive information, which users might not be willing to share, privacy protection becomes increasingly important. Adversarial Representation Learning (ARL) is a common approach to train an encoder that runs on the client-side and obfuscates an image. It is assumed, that the obfuscated image can safely be transmitted and used for the task on the server without privacy concerns. However, in this work, we find that training a reconstruction attacker can successfully recover the original image of existing ARL methods. To this end, we introduce a novel ARL method enhanced through low-pass filtering, limiting the available information amount to be encoded in the frequency domain. Our experimental results reveal that our approach withstands reconstruction attacks while outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods regarding the privacy-utility trade-off. We further conduct a user study to qualitatively assess our defense of the reconstruction attack. ",

Over the past few years, there has been an increasing interest in unsupervised and self-supervised learning paradigms as it overcomes the requirement of large scale annotated data. In this paper, we propose RAZE, a Region guided self-supervised gAZE representation learning framework which leverage from non-annotated facial image data. RAZE learns gaze representation via auxiliary supervision i.e. pseudo-gaze zone classification where the objective is to classify visual field into different gaze zones (i.e. left, right and center) by leveraging the relative position of pupil-centers. Thus, we automatically annotate pseudo gaze zone labels of 154K web-crawled images and learn feature representations via `Ize-Net' framework. `Ize-Net' is a capsule layer based CNN architecture which can efficiently capture rich eye representation. The discriminative behaviour of the feature representation is evaluated on four benchmark datasets: CAVE, TabletGaze, MPII and RT-GENE. Additionally, we evaluate the generalizability of the proposed network on two other downstream task (i.e. driver gaze estimation and visual attention estimation) which demonstrate the effectiveness of the learnt eye gaze representation.

Representation modeling methods which are free from those limitations, however, are seldom explored because of its poor performance in previous attempts. Our analyses reveal that invalid sampling method and unhealthy gradients are the main contributors to its unsatisfactory performance. In this work, we present two techniques to tackle these problems: dropout sampling and fully normalized LSTM. Based on these two techniques, we propose InitialGAN whose parameters are randomly initialized completely. Besides, we introduce a new evaluation metric, Least Coverage Rate, to better evaluate the quality of generated samples. The experimental results demonstrate that InitialGAN outperforms both MLE and other compared models. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time a language GAN can outperform MLE without any pre-training techniques. ",

As the common feature extractor of learning-based MVS, vanilla Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) suffers from discouraged feature representations for reflection and texture-less areas, which limits the generalization of MVS. Even FPNs worked with pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) fail to tackle these issues. On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved prominent success in many 2D vision tasks. Thus we ask whether ViTs can facilitate the feature learning in MVS? In this paper, we propose a pre-trained ViT enhanced MVS network called MVSFormer, which can learn more reliable feature representations benefited by informative priors from ViT. Then MVSFormer-P and MVSFormer-H are further proposed with fixed ViT weights and trainable ones respectively. MVSFormer-P is more efficient while MVSFormer-H can achieve superior performance. To make ViTs robust to arbitrary resolutions for MVS tasks, we propose to use an efficient multi-scale training with gradient accumulation. Moreover, we discuss the merits and drawbacks of classification and regression-based MVS methods, and further propose to unify them with a temperature-based strategy. MVSFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DTU dataset. Particularly, our anonymous submission of MVSFormer is ranked in the Top-1 position on both intermediate and advanced sets of the highly competitive Tanks-and-Temples leaderboard on the day of submission compared with other published works.

Other works focused on speed-up through replacing expensive optimisers and state solvers, or reducing the design-space have been attempted, but have not yet received the same attention. The portfolio of articles presenting different applications has as such become extensive, but few real breakthroughs have yet been celebrated. An overall trend in the literature is the strong faith in the \"magic\" of artificial intelligence and thus misunderstandings about the capabilities of such methods. The aim of this article is therefore to present a critical review of the current state of research in this field. To this end, an overview of the different model-applications is presented, and efforts are made to identify reasons for the overall lack of convincing success.

    "abstract": "Aspiring to achieve an accurate Bitcoin price prediction based on people's opinions on Twitter usually requires millions of tweets, using different text mining techniques (preprocessing, tokenization, stemming, stop word removal), and developing a machine learning model to perform the prediction. These attempts lead to the employment of a significant amount of computer power, central processing unit (CPU) utilization, random-access memory (RAM) usage, and time. To address this issue, in this paper, we consider a classification of tweet attributes that effects on price changes and computer resource usage levels while obtaining an accurate price prediction. To classify tweet attributes having a high effect on price movement, we collect all Bitcoin-related tweets posted in a certain period and divide them into four categories based on the following tweet attributes: $(i)$ the number of followers of the tweet poster, $(ii)$ the number of comments on the tweet, $(iii)$ the number of likes, and $(iv)$ the number of retweets. We separately train and test by using the Q-learning model with the above four categorized sets of tweets and find the best accurate prediction among them. Especially, we design several reward functions to improve the prediction accuracy of the Q-leaning. We compare our approach with a classic approach where all Bitcoin-related tweets are used as input data for the model, by analyzing the CPU workloads, RAM usage, memory, time, and prediction accuracy. The results show that tweets posted by users with the most followers have the most influence on a future price, and their utilization leads to spending 80\\% less time, 88.8\\% less CPU consumption, and 12.5\\% more accurate predictions compared with the classic approach.

In this work, we aim to address this issue by providing a simple method that could be applied to not just energy-conserving systems, but also dissipative systems, by including a different inductive bias in different cases in the form of a regularisation term in the loss function. The proposed method does not require changing the neural network architecture and could form the basis to validate a novel idea, therefore showing promises to accelerate research in this direction.

    "title": "Computing Power of Hybrid Models in Synchronous Networks",
    "abstract": "During the last two decades, a small set of distributed computing models for networks have emerged, among which LOCAL, CONGEST, and Broadcast Congested Clique (BCC) play a prominent role. We consider hybrid models resulting from combining these three models. That is, we analyze the computing power of models allowing to, say, perform a constant number of rounds of CONGEST, then a constant number of rounds of LOCAL, then a constant number of rounds of BCC, possibly repeating this figure a constant number of times. We specifically focus on 2-round models, and we establish the complete picture of the relative powers of these models. That is, for every pair of such models, we determine whether one is (strictly) stronger than the other, or whether the two models are incomparable. The separation results are obtained by approaching communication complexity through an original angle, which may be of independent interest. The two players are not bounded to compute the value of a binary function, but the combined outputs of the two players are constrained by this value. In particular, we introduce the XOR-Index problem, in which Alice is given a binary vector $x\\in\\{0,1\\}^n$ together with an index $i\\in[n]$, Bob is given a binary vector $y\\in\\{0,1\\}^n$ together with an index $j\\in[n]$, and, after a single round of 2-way communication, Alice must output a boolean $\\textrm{out}_A$, and Bob must output a boolean $\\textrm{out}_B$, such that $\\mbox{out}_A\\land\\mbox{out}_B = x_j\\oplus y_i$. We show that the communication complexity of XOR-Index is $\\Omega(n)$ bits. ",

    "abstract": "Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) is an appealing tool for the extraction of height information of urban infrastructures. Due to the widespread applications of the MUSIC algorithm in source localization, it is a suitable solution in TomoSAR when multiple snapshots (looks) are available. While the classical MUSIC algorithm aims to estimate the whole reflectivity profile of scatterers, sequential MUSIC algorithms are suited for the detection of sparse point-like scatterers. In this class of methods, successive cancellation is performed through orthogonal complement projections on the MUSIC power spectrum. In this work, a new sequential MUSIC algorithm named recursive covariance canceled MUSIC (RCC-MUSIC), is proposed. This method brings higher accuracy in comparison with the previous sequential methods at the cost of a negligible increase in computational cost. Furthermore, to improve the performance of RCC-MUSIC, it is combined with the recent method of covariance matrix estimation called correlation subspace. Utilizing the correlation subspace method results in a denoised covariance matrix which in turn, increases the accuracy of subspace-based methods. Several numerical examples are presented to compare the performance of the proposed method with the relevant state-of-the-art methods. As a subspace method, simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of estimation accuracy and computational load. ",

We consider a MIMO multi-hop system, where the source, the relay, and the destination are equipped with multiple antennas. Further, an intelligent reconfigurable surface (IRS) is established to cancel the RSI as much as possible. The considered decode-and-forward (DF) hybrid relay can operate in either half-duplex or full-duplex mode, and the mode changes adaptively depending on the RSI strength. We investigate a robust transceiver design problem, which maximizes the throughput rate corresponding to the worst-case RSI under a self-interference channel uncertainty bound constraint. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses the IRS for RSI cancellation in MIMO full-duplex DF relay systems. The yielded problem turns out to be a non-convex optimization problem, where the non-convex objective is optimized over the cone of semidefinite matrices. We propose a closed-from lower bound for the IRS worst case RSI cancellation. Eventually, we show an important result that, for the worst case scenario, IRS can be helpful only if the number of IRS elements are at least as large as the size of the interference channel. Moreover, a novel method based on majorization theory is proposed to find the best response of the transmitters and relay against worst case RSI. Furthermore, we propose a multi-level water-filling algorithm to obtain a locally optimal solution iteratively. Finally, we obtain insights on the optimal antenna allocation at the relay input-frontend and output-frontend, for relay reception and transmission, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Representation learning algorithms offer the opportunity to learn invariant representations of the input data with regard to nuisance factors. Many authors have leveraged such strategies to learn fair representations, i.e., vectors where information about sensitive attributes is removed. These methods are attractive as they may be interpreted as minimizing the mutual information between a neural layer's activations and a sensitive attribute. However, the theoretical grounding of such methods relies either on the computation of infinitely accurate adversaries or on minimizing a variational upper bound of a mutual information estimate. In this paper, we propose a methodology for direct computation of the mutual information between a neural layer and a sensitive attribute. We employ stochastically-activated binary neural networks, which lets us treat neurons as random variables. We are then able to compute (not bound) the mutual information between a layer and a sensitive attribute and use this information as a regularization factor during gradient descent. We show that this method compares favorably with the state of the art in fair representation learning and that the learned representations display a higher level of invariance compared to full-precision neural networks.

We assess this possibility in the context of an integrated TN-NTN, comprising a ground cellular deployment paired with a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellation, providing sub-6 GHz connectivity to an urban area populated by ground users (GUEs) and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). Our study reveals that offloading UAV traffic to the NTN segment drastically reduces the downlink outage of UAVs from 70% to nearly zero, also boosting their uplink signal quality as long as the LEO satellite constellation is sufficiently dense to guarantee a minimum elevation angle. Offloading UAVs to the NTN also benefits coexisting GUEs, preventing uplink outages of around 12% that GUEs would otherwise incur. Despite the limited bandwidth available below 6 GHz, NTN-offloaded UAVs meet command and control rate requirements even across an area the size of Barcelona with as many as one active UAV per cell. Smaller UAV populations yield proportionally higher rates, potentially enabling aerial broadband applications. ",

Knowledge of relict landslides' location is vital to understand their mechanisms, update inventory maps and improve risk assessment. However, relict landslide mapping is complex in tropical regions covered with rainforest vegetation. A new CNN approach is proposed for semi-automatic detection of relict landslides, which uses a dataset generated by a k-means clustering algorithm and has a pre-training step. The weights computed in the pre-training are used to fine-tune the CNN training process. A comparison between the proposed and standard approaches is performed using CBERS-4A WPM images. Three CNNs for semantic segmentation are used (U-Net, FPN, Linknet) with two augmented datasets. A total of 42 combinations of CNNs are tested. Values of precision and recall were very similar between the combinations tested. Recall was higher than 75\\% for every combination, but precision values were usually smaller than 20\\%. False positives (FP) samples were addressed as the cause for these low precision values. Predictions of the proposed approach were more accurate and correctly detected more landslides. This work demonstrates that there are limitations for detecting relict landslides in areas covered with rainforest, mainly related to similarities between the spectral response of pastures and deforested areas with \\textit{Gleichenella sp.} ferns, commonly used as an indicator of landslide scars.

Moreover, we induce the feature extractor to implicitly perceive the shape knowledge through a completion decoder, and present a geometric relation embedding for Transformer to obtain transformation-invariant geometry-aware feature representations. With the merits of more reliable overlap scores and more precise dense correspondences, UTOPIC can achieve stable and accurate registration results, even for the inputs with limited overlapping areas.

In this paper, towards the goal of better crop yield prediction, leveraging recent graph signal processing (GSP) tools to exploit spatial correlation among neighboring counties, we denoise relevant features via graph spectral filtering that are inputs to a deep learning prediction model. Specifically, we first construct a combinatorial graph with edge weights that encode county-to-county similarities in soil and location features via metric learning. We then denoise features via a maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation with a graph Laplacian regularizer (GLR). We focus on the challenge to estimate the crucial weight parameter $\\mu$, trading off the fidelity term and GLR, that is a function of noise variance in an unsupervised manner. We first estimate noise variance directly from noise-corrupted graph signals using a graph clique detection (GCD) procedure that discovers locally constant regions. We then compute an optimal $\\mu$ minimizing an approximate mean square error function via bias-variance analysis. Experimental results from collected USDA data show that using denoised features as input, performance of a crop yield prediction model can be improved noticeably. ",

We model the BAS system and formally analyze the impact of the false data injection attack on the system in term of energy cost. We find a small amount of erroneous input can incur significant energy cost, but is very hard to detect based on sensor data such as temperature alone. Since the MITM attack may disturb the KNX traffic pattern, we design a machine learning (ML) based detection strategy to detect the false data injection attack based on sophisticated features of the KNX telegram inter-arrival time. We perform real-world experiments and validate the presented false data injection attacks and ML detection strategy.

For this purpose, the notion of Zhukovskii stability, typically stated for continuous-time systems, is extended to the hybrid systems. Necessary conditions, particularly, a condition using a forward invariance notion, for existence of hybrid limit cycles are first presented. In addition, a sufficient condition, related to Zhukovskii stability, for the existence of (or lack of) hybrid limit cycles is established. Furthermore, under mild assumptions, we show that asymptotic stability of such hybrid limit cycles is not only equivalent to asymptotic stability of a fixed point of the associated Poincar\\'{e} map but also robust to perturbations. Specifically, robustness to generic perturbations, which capture state noise and unmodeled dynamics, and to inflations of the flow and jump sets are established in terms of $\\mathcal{KL}$ bounds. Furthermore, results establishing relationships between the properties of a computed Poincar\\'{e} map, which is necessarily affected by computational error, and the actual asymptotic stability properties of a hybrid limit cycle are proposed. In particular, it is shown that asymptotic stability of the exact Poincar\\'{e} map is preserved when computed with enough precision.

MGE also enhances the state-of-the-art Grammatical Evolution (GE) methods in two directions. First, MGE's representation is modular in that each individual has a set of genes, and each gene is mapped to a neuron by grammatical rules. Second, the proposed representation mitigates two important drawbacks of GE, namely the low scalability and weak locality of representation, towards generating modular and multi-layer networks with a high number of neurons. We define and evaluate five different forms of structures with and without modularity using MGE and find single-layer modules with no coupling more productive. Our experiments demonstrate that modularity helps in finding better neural networks faster. We have validated the proposed method using ten well-known classification benchmarks with different sizes, feature counts, and output class count. Our experimental results indicate that MGE provides superior accuracy with respect to existing NeuroEvolution methods and returns classifiers that are significantly simpler than other machine learning generated classifiers. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that MGE outperforms other GE methods in terms of locality and scalability properties. ",

The first regime is near initialization, specifically until the weights have moved by $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt m)$, where $m$ denotes the network width, which is in sharp contrast to the $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ weight motion allowed by the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK); here it is shown that GF and SGD only need a network width and number of samples inversely proportional to the NTK margin, and moreover that GF attains at least the NTK margin itself, which suffices to establish escape from bad KKT points of the margin objective, whereas prior work could only establish nondecreasing but arbitrarily small margins. The second regime is the Neural Collapse (NC) setting, where data lies in extremely-well-separated groups, and the sample complexity scales with the number of groups; here the contribution over prior work is an analysis of the entire GF trajectory from initialization. Lastly, if the inner layer weights are constrained to change in norm only and can not rotate, then GF with large widths achieves globally maximal margins, and its sample complexity scales with their inverse; this is in contrast to prior work, which required infinite width and a tricky dual convergence assumption. As purely technical contributions, this work develops a variety of potential functions and other tools which will hopefully aid future work. ",

We draw on an online survey (N=144) and semi-structured interviews (N=21) with teenagers, ages 13-19, to gain a better understanding how teenagers configure privacy on the popular image-sharing platform Instagram and why they make these privacy decisions. Finally, based on our findings, we provide design recommendations towards the design of better privacy controls for promoting teenage safety online. ",

    "abstract": "Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged and shown their benefits over discrete representations in recent years. However, fitting an INR to the given observations usually requires optimization with gradient descent from scratch, which is inefficient and does not generalize well with sparse observations. To address this problem, most of the prior works train a hypernetwork that generates a single vector to modulate the INR weights, where the single vector becomes an information bottleneck that limits the reconstruction precision of the output INR. Recent work shows that the whole set of weights in INR can be precisely inferred without the single-vector bottleneck by gradient-based meta-learning. Motivated by a generalized formulation of gradient-based meta-learning, we propose a formulation that uses Transformers as hypernetworks for INRs, where it can directly build the whole set of INR weights with Transformers specialized as set-to-set mapping. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for building INRs in different tasks and domains, including 2D image regression and view synthesis for 3D objects. Our work draws connections between the Transformer hypernetworks and gradient-based meta-learning algorithms and we provide further analysis for understanding the generated INRs.

    "abstract": "Domain generalization (DG) aims to learn a model on one or more different but related source domains that could be generalized into an unseen target domain. Existing DG methods try to prompt the diversity of source domains for the model's generalization ability, while they may have to introduce auxiliary networks or striking computational costs. On the contrary, this work applies the implicit semantic augmentation in feature space to capture the diversity of source domains. Concretely, an additional loss function of distance metric learning (DML) is included to optimize the local geometry of data distribution. Besides, the logits from cross entropy loss with infinite augmentations is adopted as input features for the DML loss in lieu of the deep features. We also provide a theoretical analysis to show that the logits can approximate the distances defined on original features well. Further, we provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanism and rational behind our approach, which gives us a better understanding of why leverage logits in lieu of features can help domain generalization. The proposed DML loss with the implicit augmentation is incorporated into a recent DG method, that is, Fourier Augmented Co-Teacher framework (FACT). Meanwhile, our method also can be easily plugged into various DG methods. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks (Digits-DG, PACS and Office-Home) have demonstrated that the proposed method is able to achieve the state-of-the-art performance. ",

In this article we introduce a method that permits us to measure the impact of environmental variations and we analyze the relation between the amplitude of variations, the modality with which they are introduced, and the performance and robustness of evolving agents. Our results demonstrate that (i) the evolutionary algorithm can tolerate environmental variations which have a very high impact, (ii) variations affecting the actions of the agent are tolerated much better than variations affecting the initial state of the agent or of the environment, and (iii) improving the accuracy of the fitness measure through multiple evaluations is not always useful. Moreover, our results show that environmental variations permit generating solutions which perform better both in varying and non-varying environments. ",

    "abstract": "Recent analyses of self-supervised learning (SSL) find the following data-centric properties to be critical for learning good representations: invariance to task-irrelevant semantics, separability of classes in some latent space, and recoverability of labels from augmented samples. However, given their discrete, non-Euclidean nature, graph datasets and graph SSL methods are unlikely to satisfy these properties. This raises the question: how do graph SSL methods, such as contrastive learning (CL), work well? To systematically probe this question, we perform a generalization analysis for CL when using generic graph augmentations (GGAs), with a focus on data-centric properties. Our analysis yields formal insights into the limitations of GGAs and the necessity of task-relevant augmentations. As we empirically show, GGAs do not induce task-relevant invariances on common benchmark datasets, leading to only marginal gains over naive, untrained baselines. Our theory motivates a synthetic data generation process that enables control over task-relevant information and boasts pre-defined optimal augmentations. This flexible benchmark helps us identify yet unrecognized limitations in advanced augmentation techniques (e.g., automated methods). Overall, our work rigorously contextualizes, both empirically and theoretically, the effects of data-centric properties on augmentation strategies and learning paradigms for graph SSL. ",

    "abstract": "With the presence of online collaborative tools for software developers, source code is shared and consulted frequently, from code viewers to merge requests and code snippets. Typically, code highlighting quality in such scenarios is sacrificed in favor of system responsiveness. In these on-the-fly settings, performing a formal grammatical analysis of the source code is not only expensive, but also intractable for the many times the input is an invalid derivation of the language. Indeed, current popular highlighters heavily rely on a system of regular expressions, typically far from the specification of the language's lexer. Due to their complexity, regular expressions need to be periodically updated as more feedback is collected from the users and their design unwelcome the detection of more complex language formations. This paper delivers a deep learning-based approach suitable for on-the-fly grammatical code highlighting of correct and incorrect language derivations, such as code viewers and snippets. It focuses on alleviating the burden on the developers, who can reuse the language's parsing strategy to produce the desired highlighting specification. Moreover, this approach is compared to nowadays online syntax highlighting tools and formal methods in terms of accuracy and execution time, across different levels of grammatical coverage, for three mainstream programming languages. The results obtained show how the proposed approach can consistently achieve near-perfect accuracy in its predictions, thereby outperforming regular expression-based strategies. ",

In this paper, we study the on-demand wireless resource orchestration problem with the focus on the computing delay in orchestration decision-making process. Specifically, we take the decision-making delay into the optimization problem. Then, a dynamic neural network (DyNN)-based method is proposed, where the model complexity can be adjusted according to the service requirements. We further build a knowledge base representing the relationship among the service requirements, available computing resources, and the resource allocation performance. By exploiting the knowledge, the width of DyNN can be selected in a timely manner, further improving the performance of orchestration. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the traditional static neural network, and also shows sufficient flexibility in on-demand service provisioning. ",

This study focuses on solving the problem of domestic activity clustering from audio. The target of domestic activity clustering is to cluster audio clips which belong to the same category of domestic activity into one cluster in an unsupervised way. In this paper, we propose a method of domestic activity clustering using a depthwise separable convolutional autoencoder network. In the proposed method, initial embeddings are learned by the depthwise separable convolutional autoencoder, and a clustering-oriented loss is designed to jointly optimize embedding refinement and cluster assignment. Different methods are evaluated on a public dataset (a derivative of the SINS dataset) used in the challenge on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) in 2018. Our method obtains the normalized mutual information (NMI) score of 54.46%, and the clustering accuracy (CA) score of 63.64%, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of NMI and CA. In addition, both computational complexity and memory requirement of our method is lower than that of previous deep-model-based methods.

    "abstract": "There has been an increased interest in applying machine learning techniques on relational structured-data based on an observed graph. Often, this graph is not fully representative of the true relationship amongst nodes. In these settings, building a generative model conditioned on the observed graph allows to take the graph uncertainty into account. Various existing techniques either rely on restrictive assumptions, fail to preserve topological properties within the samples or are prohibitively expensive for larger graphs. In this work, we introduce the node copying model for constructing a distribution over graphs. Sampling of a random graph is carried out by replacing each node's neighbors by those of a randomly sampled similar node. The sampled graphs preserve key characteristics of the graph structure without explicitly targeting them. Additionally, sampling from this model is extremely simple and scales linearly with the nodes. We show the usefulness of the copying model in three tasks. First, in node classification, a Bayesian formulation based on node copying achieves higher accuracy in sparse data settings. Second, we employ our proposed model to mitigate the effect of adversarial attacks on the graph topology. Last, incorporation of the model in a recommendation system setting improves recall over state-of-the-art methods. ",

Multi-modal volumetric concept activation was used to provide global and local explanations. Sensitivity was 80% at 1.78 false positive per patient. Global explanations showed that detection focused on CT for anatomical location and on PET for its confidence in the detection.

Such a model can then be synthesized into a hardware accelerator for use in quantum systems. In this study, we demonstrate a machine learning algorithm for predicting optimal pulse parameters. This algorithm is lightweight enough to fit on a low-resource FPGA and perform inference with a latency of 175 ns and pipeline interval of 5 ns with $~>~$0.99 gate fidelity. In the long term, such an accelerator could be used near quantum computing hardware where traditional computers cannot operate, enabling quantum control at a reasonable cost at low latencies without incurring large data bandwidths outside of the cryogenic environment.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) applied to a device's radio-frequency fingerprint~(RFF) has attracted significant attention in physical-layer authentications due to its extraordinary classification performance. Conventional DL-RFF techniques, trained by adopting maximum likelihood estimation~(MLE), tend to overfit the channel statistics embedded in the training dataset. This restricts their practical applications as it is challenging to collect sufficient training data capturing the characteristics of all possible wireless channel environments. To address this challenge, we propose a DL framework of disentangled representation learning~(DRL) that first learns to factor the input signals into a device-relevant component and a device-irrelevant component via adversarial learning. Then, it synthesizes a set of augmented signals by shuffling these two parts within a given training dataset for training of subsequent RFF extractor. The implicit data augmentation in the proposed framework imposes a regularization on the RFF extractor to avoid the possible overfitting of device-irrelevant channel statistics, without collecting additional data from unknown channels. Experiments validate that the proposed approach, referred to as DR-RFF, outperforms conventional methods in terms of generalizability to unknown complicated propagation environments, e.g., dispersive multipath fading channels, even though all the training data are collected in a simple environment with dominated direct line-of-sight~(LoS) propagation paths.
