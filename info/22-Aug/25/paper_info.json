    "abstract": "Entity alignment is a crucial task in knowledge graph fusion. However, most entity alignment approaches have the scalability problem. Recent methods address this issue by dividing large KGs into small blocks for embedding and alignment learning in each. However, such a partitioning and learning process results in an excessive loss of structure and alignment. Therefore, in this work, we propose a scalable GNN-based entity alignment approach to reduce the structure and alignment loss from three perspectives. First, we propose a centrality-based subgraph generation algorithm to recall some landmark entities serving as the bridges between different subgraphs. Second, we introduce self-supervised entity reconstruction to recover entity representations from incomplete neighborhood subgraphs, and design cross-subgraph negative sampling to incorporate entities from other subgraphs in alignment learning. Third, during the inference process, we merge the embeddings of subgraphs to make a single space for alignment search. Experimental results on the benchmark OpenEA dataset and the proposed large DBpedia1M dataset verify the effectiveness of our approach. ",

We develop a method based on a variational approach leading to an optimality equation which is then projected into a finite dimensional space. Discretization yields a linear although severely ill-posed equation which is then regularized via appropriate ad-hoc penalizers resulting a in a generalized Tikhonov-Phillips functional. No smoothness assumptions are imposed on the conductivity. Numerical examples for the case in which the conductivity can take only two prescribed values (a two-materials case) show that the approach is able to produce very good reconstructions of the exact solution.

Recent works show that parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) can be used to solve challenging reinforcement learning (RL) tasks with provable learning advantages. While existing works yield potentials of PQC-based methods, the design choices of PQC architectures and their influences on the learning tasks are generally underexplored. In this work, we introduce EQAS-PQC, an evolutionary quantum architecture search framework for PQC-based models, which uses a population-based genetic algorithm to evolve PQC architectures by exploring the search space of quantum operations. Experimental results show that our method can significantly improve the performance of hybrid quantum-classical models in solving benchmark reinforcement problems.

With their unique disability identity, it is not clear how PWD perceive their avatars and whether and how they prefer to disclose their disability when presenting themselves in social VR. We fill this gap by exploring PWD's avatar perception and disability disclosure preferences in social VR. Our study involved two steps. We first conducted a systematic review of fifteen popular social VR applications to evaluate their avatar diversity and accessibility support. We then conducted an in-depth interview study with 19 participants who had different disabilities to understand their avatar experiences. Our research revealed a number of disability disclosure preferences and strategies adopted by PWD (e.g., reflect selective disabilities, present a capable self). We also identified several challenges faced by PWD during their avatar customization process. We discuss the design implications to promote avatar accessibility and diversity for future social VR platforms. ",

We evaluate state-of-the-art and classical data augmentation strategies with different levels of synthetic noise for the datasets MNist, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and the real-world dataset Clothing1M.

Results show that the appropriate selection of data augmentation can drastically improve the model robustness to label noise, increasing up to 177.84% of relative best test accuracy compared to the baseline with no augmentation, and an increase of up to 6% in absolute value with the state-of-the-art DivideMix training strategy.

    "abstract": "Relying on the fact that not all inputs require the same amount of computation to yield a confident prediction, multi-exit networks are gaining attention as a prominent approach for pushing the limits of efficient deployment. Multi-exit networks endow a backbone model with early exits, allowing to obtain predictions at intermediate layers of the model and thus save computation time and/or energy. However, current various designs of multi-exit networks are only considered to achieve the best trade-off between resource usage efficiency and prediction accuracy, the privacy risks stemming from them have never been explored. This prompts the need for a comprehensive investigation of privacy risks in multi-exit networks. In this paper, we perform the first privacy analysis of multi-exit networks through the lens of membership leakages. In particular, we first leverage the existing attack methodologies to quantify the multi-exit networks' vulnerability to membership leakages. Our experimental results show that multi-exit networks are less vulnerable to membership leakages and the exit (number and depth) attached to the backbone model is highly correlated with the attack performance. Furthermore, we propose a hybrid attack that exploits the exit information to improve the performance of existing attacks. We evaluate membership leakage threat caused by our hybrid attack under three different adversarial setups, ultimately arriving at a model-free and data-free adversary. These results clearly demonstrate that our hybrid attacks are very broadly applicable, thereby the corresponding risks are much more severe than shown by existing membership inference attacks. We further present a defense mechanism called TimeGuard specifically for multi-exit networks and show that TimeGuard mitigates the newly proposed attacks perfectly. ",

    "abstract": "Traditional analyses in non-convex optimization typically rely on the smoothness assumption, namely requiring the gradients to be Lipschitz. However, recent evidence shows that this smoothness condition does not capture the properties of some deep learning objective functions, including the ones involving Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTMs. Instead, they satisfy a much more relaxed condition, with potentially unbounded smoothness. Under this relaxed assumption, it has been theoretically and empirically shown that the gradient-clipped SGD has an advantage over the vanilla one. In this paper, we show that clipping is not indispensable for Adam-type algorithms in tackling such scenarios: we theoretically prove that a generalized SignSGD algorithm can obtain similar convergence rates as SGD with clipping but does not need explicit clipping at all. This family of algorithms on one end recovers SignSGD and on the other end closely resembles the popular Adam algorithm. Our analysis underlines the critical role that momentum plays in analyzing SignSGD-type and Adam-type algorithms: it not only reduces the effects of noise, thus removing the need for large mini-batch in previous analyses of SignSGD-type algorithms, but it also substantially reduces the effects of unbounded smoothness and gradient norms. We also compare these algorithms with popular optimizers on a set of deep learning tasks, observing that we can match the performance of Adam while beating the others. ",

In applications such as biological, social, and transportation networks, interactions between objects span multiple aspects. Multilayer (ML) networks have been proposed for accurately modeling such applications. In this paper, we present FirmCore, a new family of dense subgraphs in ML networks, and show that it satisfies many of the nice properties of $k$-cores in single-layer graphs. Unlike the state of the art core decomposition of ML graphs, FirmCores have a polynomial time algorithm, making them a powerful tool for understanding the structure of massive ML networks. We also extend FirmCore for directed ML graphs. We show that FirmCores and directed FirmCores can be used to obtain efficient approximation algorithms for finding the densest subgraphs of ML graphs and their directed counterparts. Our extensive experiments over several real ML graphs show that our FirmCore decomposition algorithm is significantly more efficient than known algorithms for core decompositions of ML graphs. Furthermore, it returns solutions of matching or better quality for the densest subgraph problem over (possibly directed) ML graphs. ",

Over the years, numerous methods have been proposed for time series anomaly detection using deep learning-based methods. Many of these methods demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, giving the false impression that these systems are robust and deployable in many practical and industrial real-world scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate that the performance of state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods is degraded substantially by adding only small adversarial perturbations to the sensor data. We use different scoring metrics such as prediction errors, anomaly, and classification scores over several public and private datasets ranging from aerospace applications, server machines, to cyber-physical systems in power plants. Under well-known adversarial attacks from Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) methods, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) methods, which claim to be robust against anomalies and have been possibly integrated in real-life systems, have their performance drop to as low as 0%. To the best of our understanding, we demonstrate, for the first time, the vulnerabilities of anomaly detection systems against adversarial attacks.

Previous works assumed strong prior knowledge about the incoming data (e.g., knowing the class boundaries) which can be impossible to obtain in complex and unpredictable environments. In this paper, motivated by real-world scenarios, we formally define the online unsupervised lifelong learning problem with class-incremental streaming data, which is non-iid and single-pass. The problem is more challenging than existing lifelong learning problems due to the absence of labels and prior knowledge. To address the issue, we propose Self-Supervised ContrAstive Lifelong LEarning (SCALE) which extracts and memorizes knowledge on-the-fly. SCALE is designed around three major components: a pseudo-supervised contrastive loss, a self-supervised forgetting loss, and an online memory update for uniform subset selection. All three components are designed to work collaboratively to maximize learning performance. Our loss functions leverage pairwise similarity thus remove the dependency on supervision or prior knowledge. We perform comprehensive experiments of SCALE under iid and four non-iid data streams. SCALE outperforms the best state-of-the-art algorithm on all settings with improvements of up to 6.43%, 5.23% and 5.86% kNN accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SubImageNet datasets. ",

Another important advantage is that each data point is sanitized independently from the others, and therefore different users may use different levels of obfuscation depending on their privacy requirements, or they may even use entirely different mechanisms depending on the services they are trading their data for. A challenging requirement in this setting is to construct the original distribution on the users sensitive data from their noisy versions. Existing techniques can only estimate that distribution separately on each obfuscation schema and corresponding noisy data subset. But the smaller are the subsets, the more imprecise the estimations are. In this paper we study how to avoid the subsets-fractioning problem when combining local privacy mechanisms, thus recovering an optimal utility. We focus on the estimation of the original distribution, and on the two main methods to estimate it: the matrix-inversion method and the iterative Bayes update. We consider various cases of combination of local privacy mechanisms, and compare the flexibility and the performance of the two methods. ",

    "title": "Long Code for Code Search",
    "abstract": "Thanks to the Transformer-based pretraining models, the performance of code search has been improved significantly. However, due to the restriction of multi-head self-attention and GPU memory, there is a limit on the input token length. The existing pretrained code models, such as GraphCodeBERT, CodeBERT, RoBERTa (code), take the first 256 tokens by default, which makes them unable to represent the complete information of long code (i.e., code that is greater than 256 tokens). Unlike the long text document that can be regarded as a whole with complete semantics, the semantics of long code is discontinuous as a piece of long code may contain different code modules. Therefore, it is unreasonable to directly apply the long text processing methods to long code. To tackle the long code problem, we propose MLCS (Modeling Long Code for Code Search) to obtain a better representation for long code. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of MLCS for long code retrieval. With MLCS, we could use Transformer-based pretraining models to model long code without changing their internal structure and re-pretraining. Through AST-based splitting and attention-based fusion methods, MLCS achieves an overall mean reciprocal ranking (MRR) score of 0.785, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art result of 0.713 on the public CodeSearchNet benchmark.

    "abstract": "With a good code search engine, developers can reuse existing code snippets and accelerate software development process. Current code search methods can be divided into two categories: traditional information retrieval (IR) based and deep learning (DL) based approaches. DL-based approaches include the cross-encoder paradigm and the bi-encoder paradigm. However, both approaches have certain limitations. The inference of IR-based and bi-encoder models are fast, however, they are not accurate enough; while cross-encoder models can achieve higher search accuracy but consume more time. In this work, we propose TOSS, a two-stage fusion code search framework that can combine the advantages of different code search methods. TOSS first uses IR-based and bi-encoder models to efficiently recall a small number of top-k code candidates, and then uses fine-grained cross-encoders for finer ranking. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments on different code candidate volumes and multiple programming languages to verify the effectiveness of TOSS. We also compare TOSS with six data fusion methods. Experimental results show that TOSS is not only efficient, but also achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with an overall mean reciprocal ranking (MRR) score of 0.763, compared to the best baseline result on the CodeSearchNet benchmark of 0.713.

    "abstract": "In dermatological disease diagnosis, the private data collected by mobile dermatology assistants exist on distributed mobile devices of patients. Federated learning (FL) can use decentralized data to train models while keeping data local. Existing FL methods assume all the data have labels. However, medical data often comes without full labels due to high labeling costs. Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, contrastive learning (CL) and masked autoencoders (MAE), can leverage the unlabeled data to pre-train models, followed by fine-tuning with limited labels. However, combining SSL and FL has unique challenges. For example, CL requires diverse data but each device only has limited data. For MAE, while Vision Transformer (ViT) based MAE has higher accuracy over CNNs in centralized learning, MAE's performance in FL with unlabeled data has not been investigated. Besides, the ViT synchronization between the server and clients is different from traditional CNNs. Therefore, special synchronization methods need to be designed. In this work, we propose two federated self-supervised learning frameworks for dermatological disease diagnosis with limited labels. The first one features lower computation costs, suitable for mobile devices. The second one features high accuracy and fits high-performance servers. Based on CL, we proposed federated contrastive learning with feature sharing (FedCLF). Features are shared for diverse contrastive information without sharing raw data for privacy. Based on MAE, we proposed FedMAE. Knowledge split separates the global and local knowledge learned from each client. Only global knowledge is aggregated for higher generalization performance. Experiments on dermatological disease datasets show superior accuracy of the proposed frameworks over state-of-the-arts. ",

Such AI systems are generally considered as stand-alone for decision support, with ethical assessments, guidelines and frameworks applied to them through this lens. However, as the prevalence of AI increases in this domain, such systems will interact through information flow networks created by interacting decision-making entities, leading to often ill-understood multi-AI complex systems. In this paper we describe how these multi-AI systems can arise, even in relatively simple real-world humanitarian response scenarios, and lead to potentially emergent and erratic erroneous behavior. We discuss how we can better work towards more trustworthy multi-AI systems by exploring some of their associated challenges and opportunities, and how we can design better mechanisms to understand and assess such systems. This paper is designed to be a first exposition on this topic in the field of humanitarian response, raising awareness, exploring the possible landscape of this domain, and providing a starting point for future work within the wider community.

    "abstract": "Recently, some span-based methods have achieved encouraging performances for joint aspect-sentiment analysis, which first extract aspects (aspect extraction) by detecting aspect boundaries and then classify the span-level sentiments (sentiment classification). However, most existing approaches either sequentially extract task-specific features, leading to insufficient feature interactions, or they encode aspect features and sentiment features in a parallel manner, implying that feature representation in each task is largely independent of each other except for input sharing. Both of them ignore the internal correlations between the aspect extraction and sentiment classification. To solve this problem, we novelly propose a hierarchical interactive network (HI-ASA) to model two-way interactions between two tasks appropriately, where the hierarchical interactions involve two steps: shallow-level interaction and deep-level interaction. First, we utilize cross-stitch mechanism to combine the different task-specific features selectively as the input to ensure proper two-way interactions. Second, the mutual information technique is applied to mutually constrain learning between two tasks in the output layer, thus the aspect input and the sentiment input are capable of encoding features of the other task via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate HI-ASA's superiority over baselines. ",

Despite the current development in this direction, the efficient capture and processing of important sequential and spatial information, in a direct and simultaneous way, is still relatively under-explored. To overcome the challenge and unlock the potentials of neural networks for motion planning tasks, in this paper, we propose STP-Net, an end-to-end learning framework that can fully extract and leverage important spatio-temporal information to form an efficient neural motion planner. By interpreting the movement of the robot as a video clip, robot motion planning is transformed to a video prediction task that can be performed by STP-Net in both spatially and temporally efficient ways. Empirical evaluations across different seen and unseen environments show that, with nearly 100% accuracy (aka, success rate), STP-Net demonstrates very promising performance with respect to both planning speed and path cost. Compared with existing NN-based motion planners, STP-Net achieves at least 5x, 2.6x and 1.8x faster speed with lower path cost on 2D Random Forest, 2D Maze and 3D Random Forest environments, respectively. Furthermore, STP-Net can quickly and simultaneously compute multiple near-optimal paths in multi-robot motion planning tasks ",

In this work, we propose a method to leverage weak/noisy labels (e.g., risk scores generated by machine rules for detecting malware) that are cheaper to obtain for anomaly detection. Specifically, we propose ADMoE, the first framework for anomaly detection algorithms to learn from noisy labels. In a nutshell, ADMoE leverages mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture to encourage specialized and scalable learning from multiple noisy sources. It captures the similarities among noisy labels by sharing most model parameters, while encouraging specialization by building \"expert\" sub-networks. To further juice out the signals from noisy labels, ADMoE uses them as input features to facilitate expert learning. Extensive results on eight datasets (including a proprietary enterprise security dataset) demonstrate the effectiveness of ADMoE, where it brings up to 34% performance improvement over not using it. Also, it outperforms a total of 13 leading baselines with equivalent network parameters and FLOPS. Notably, ADMoE is model-agnostic to enable any neural network-based detection methods to handle noisy labels, where we showcase its results on both multiple-layer perceptron (MLP) and the leading AD method DeepSAD.

Most approaches assume optimal illumination and slow camera motion. These assumptions are often violated in robotic applications, where images contain motion blur and the scene may not have suitable illumination. This can cause significant problems for downstream tasks such as navigation, inspection or visualization of the scene. To alleviate these problems we present E-NeRF, the first method which estimates a volumetric scene representation in the form of a NeRF from a fast-moving event camera. Our method can recover NeRFs during very fast motion and in high dynamic range conditions, where frame-based approaches fail. We show that rendering high-quality frames is possible by only providing an event stream as input. Furthermore, by combining events and frames, we can estimate NeRFs of higher quality than state-of-the-art approaches under severe motion blur. We also show that combining events and frames can overcome failure cases of NeRF estimation in scenarios where only few input views are available, without requiring additional regularization. ",

Some of proposals of data aggregation protocols use the blinding technique of Shi et al. for BGN cryptosystem, an additive homomorphic encryption. Previously, there have been some security analysis on some of BGN based data aggregation protocols in the context of integrity or authenticity of data. Even with such security analysis, the BGN cryptosystem has been a popular building block of privacy preserving data aggregation protocol. In this paper, we study the privacy issues in the blinding technique of Shi et al. used for BGN cryptosystem. We show that the blinding techniques for the BGN cryptosystem used in several protocols are not privacy preserving against the recipient, the decryptor. Our analysis is based on the fact that the BGN cryptosystem uses a pairing e:GxG-->G_T and the existence of the pairing makes the DDH problem on G easy to solve. We also suggest how to prevent such privacy leakage in the blinding technique of Shi et al. used for BGN cryptosystem. ",

Therefore, finding the best object detection algorithm is essential to apply it effectively. Many object detection algorithms have been released, and many have compared object detection algorithms, but few have compared the latest algorithms, such as YOLOv5, primarily which focus on street-level objects. This paper compares various one-stage detector algorithms; SSD MobileNetv2 FPN-lite 320x320, YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5s for street-level object detection within real-time images. The experiment utilizes a modified Udacity Self Driving Car Dataset with 3,169 images. Dataset is split into train, validation, and test; Then, it is preprocessed and augmented using rescaling, hue shifting, and noise. Each algorithm is then trained and evaluated. Based on the experiments, the algorithms have produced decent results according to the inference time and the values of their precision, recall, F1-Score, and Mean Average Precision (mAP). The results also shows that YOLOv5l outperforms the other algorithms in terms of accuracy with a mAP@.5 of 0.593, MobileNetv2 FPN-lite has the fastest inference time among the others with only 3.20ms inference time. It is also found that YOLOv5s is the most efficient, with it having a YOLOv5l accuracy and a speed almost as quick as the MobileNetv2 FPN-lite. This shows that various algorithm are suitable for street-level object detection and viable enough to be used in self-driving car. ",

Existing fairness testing approaches are mostly designed for identifying individual discrimination, i.e., discrimination against individuals. Yet, as another widely concerning type of discrimination, testing against group discrimination, mostly hidden, is much less studied. To address the gap, in this work, we propose TESTSGD, an interpretable testing approach which systematically identifies and measures hidden (which we call `subtle' group discrimination} of a neural network characterized by conditions over combinations of the sensitive features. Specifically, given a neural network, TESTSGDfirst automatically generates an interpretable rule set which categorizes the input space into two groups exposing the model's group discrimination. Alongside, TESTSGDalso provides an estimated group fairness score based on sampling the input space to measure the degree of the identified subtle group discrimination, which is guaranteed to be accurate up to an error bound. We evaluate TESTSGDon multiple neural network models trained on popular datasets including both structured data and text data. The experiment results show that TESTSGDis effective and efficient in identifying and measuring such subtle group discrimination that has never been revealed before. Furthermore, we show that the testing results of TESTSGDcan guide generation of new samples to mitigate such discrimination through retraining with negligible accuracy drop. ",

    "abstract": "As an efficient algorithm to solve the multi-view registration problem,the motion averaging (MA) algorithm has been extensively studied and many MA-based algorithms have been introduced. They aim at recovering global motions from relative motions and exploiting information redundancy to average accumulative errors. However, one property of these methods is that they use Guass-Newton method to solve a least squares problem for the increment of global motions, which may lead to low efficiency and poor robustness to outliers. In this paper, we propose a novel motion averaging framework for the multi-view registration with Laplacian kernel-based maximum correntropy criterion (LMCC). Utilizing the Lie algebra motion framework and the correntropy measure, we propose a new cost function that takes all constraints supplied by relative motions into account. Obtaining the increment used to correct the global motions, can further be formulated as an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the cost function. By virtue of the quadratic technique, the optimization problem can be solved by dividing into two subproblems, i.e., computing the weight for each relative motion according to the current residuals and solving a second-order cone program problem (SOCP) for the increment in the next iteration. We also provide a novel strategy for determining the kernel width which ensures that our method can efficiently exploit information redundancy supplied by relative motions in the presence of many outliers. Finally, we compare the proposed method with other MA-based multi-view registration methods to verify its performance. Experimental tests on synthetic and real data demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in terms of efficiency, accuracy and robustness. ",

Specifically, we train a self-supervised prediction model and save a set of snapshots of the model parameters, without incurring addition training cost. Then we employ nuclear norm to evaluate the temporal inconsistency between the predictions of different snapshots, which can be further deployed as the intrinsic reward. Moreover, a variational weighting mechanism is proposed to assign weight to different snapshots in an adaptive manner. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in various benchmark environments.

In addition to the well-known application for clustering malware, we show that fuzzy hashes and deep learning are indeed well-suited to classify files according to the presence of certain content, e.g., malware. DLAM relies on transformer-based models from the field of natural language processing and outperforms existing methods. Traditional fuzzy hashes like TLSH and ssdeep have a limited size and fail to detect file anomalies if they are relatively small compared to the overall file size. DLAM, however, enables the detection of such file correlations in the computed fuzzy hashes of TLSH and ssdeep, even for anomaly sizes of less than 15%. It achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art fuzzy hashing algorithms while relying on more efficient hash computations and can, therefore, be used at a much larger scale. ",

To prevent this, Privacy by Design is often proposed as a solution for data protection. In this paper, the effect of camera distortions is studied using Deep Learning techniques commonly used to extract sensitive data. To do so, we simulate out-of-focus images corresponding to a realistic conventional camera with fixed focal length, aperture, and focus, as well as grayscale images coming from a monochrome camera. We then prove, through an experimental study, that we can build a privacy-aware camera that cannot extract personal information such as license plate numbers. At the same time, we ensure that useful non-sensitive data can still be extracted from distorted images. Code is available at https://github.com/upciti/privacy-by-design-semseg . ",

    "abstract": "Asynchronous Time Series is a multivariate time series where all the channels are observed asynchronously-independently, making the time series extremely sparse when aligning them. We often observe this effect in applications with complex observation processes, such as health care, climate science, and astronomy, to name a few. Because of the asynchronous nature, they pose a significant challenge to deep learning architectures, which presume that the time series presented to them are regularly sampled, fully observed, and aligned with respect to time. This paper proposes a novel framework, that we call Deep Convolutional Set Functions (DCSF), which is highly scalable and memory efficient, for the asynchronous time series classification task. With the recent advancements in deep set learning architectures, we introduce a model that is invariant to the order in which time series' channels are presented to it. We explore convolutional neural networks, which are well researched for the closely related problem-classification of regularly sampled and fully observed time series, for encoding the set elements. We evaluate DCSF for AsTS classification, and online (per time point) AsTS classification. Our extensive experiments on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets verify that the suggested model performs substantially better than a range of state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and run time.

    "abstract": "In feed-forward time-sensitive networks with Deficit Round-Robin (DRR), worst-case delay bounds were obtained by combining Total Flow Analysis (TFA) with the strict service curve characterization of DRR by Tabatabaee et al. The latter is the best-known single server analysis of DRR, however the former is dominated by Polynomial-size Linear Programming (PLP), which improves the TFA bounds and stability region, but was never applied to DRR networks. We first perform the necessary adaptation of PLP to DRR by computing burstiness bounds per-class and per-output aggregate and by enabling PLP to support non-convex service curves. Second, we extend the methodology to support networks with cyclic dependencies: This raises further dependency loops, as, on one hand, DRR strict service curves rely on traffic characteristics inside the network, which comes as output of the network analysis, and on the other hand, TFA or PLP requires prior knowledge of the DRR service curves. This can be solved by iterative methods, however PLP itself requires making cuts, which imposes other levels of iteration, and it is not clear how to combine them. We propose a generic method, called PLP-DRR, for combining all the iterations sequentially or in parallel. We show that the obtained bounds are always valid even before convergence; furthermore, at convergence, the bounds are the same regardless of how the iterations are combined. This provides the best-known worst-case bounds for time-sensitive networks, with general topology, with DRR. We apply the method to an industrial network, where we find significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art. ",

In this paper, we adapt RBF networks as a classifier on top of CNNs by modifying the training process and introducing a new activation function to train modern vision architectures end-to-end for image classification. The specific architecture of RBFs enables the learning of a similarity distance metric to compare and find similar and dissimilar images. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using an RBF classifier on top of any CNN architecture provides new human-interpretable insights about the decision-making process of the models.

Nonetheless, due to the high texture variability present in endoscopic images, the development of robust and accurate feature matching becomes a challenging task. Recently, deep learning techniques which deliver learned features extracted via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have gained traction in a wide range of computer vision tasks. However, they all follow a supervised learning scheme where a large amount of annotated data is required to reach good performances, which is generally not always available for medical data databases. To overcome this limitation related to labeled data scarcity, the self-supervised learning paradigm has recently shown great success in a number of applications. This paper proposes a novel self-supervised approach for endoscopic image matching based on deep learning techniques. When compared to standard hand-crafted local feature descriptors, our method outperformed them in terms of precision and recall. Furthermore, our self-supervised descriptor provides a competitive performance in comparison to a selection of state-of-the-art deep learning based supervised methods in terms of precision and matching score.

In this work, we propose a novel detection method for adversarial examples to prevent attacks.

    "abstract": "Multi-scenario recommendation is dedicated to retrieve relevant items for users in multiple scenarios, which is ubiquitous in industrial recommendation systems. These scenarios enjoy portions of overlaps in users and items, while the distribution of different scenarios is different. The key point of multi-scenario modeling is to efficiently maximize the use of whole-scenario information and granularly generate adaptive representations both for users and items among multiple scenarios. we summarize three practical challenges which are not well solved for multi-scenario modeling: (1) Lacking of fine-grained and decoupled information transfer controls among multiple scenarios. (2) Insufficient exploitation of entire space samples. (3) Item's multi-scenario representation disentanglement problem. In this paper, we propose a Scenario-Adaptive and Self-Supervised (SASS) model to solve the three challenges mentioned above. Specifically, we design a Multi-Layer Scenario Adaptive Transfer (ML-SAT) module with scenario-adaptive gate units to select and fuse effective transfer information from whole scenario to individual scenario in a quite fine-grained and decoupled way. To sufficiently exploit the power of entire space samples, a two-stage training process including pre-training and fine-tune is introduced. The pre-training stage is based on a scenario-supervised contrastive learning task with the training samples drawn from labeled and unlabeled data spaces. The model is created symmetrically both in user side and item side, so that we can get distinguishing representations of items in different scenarios. Extensive experimental results on public and industrial datasets demonstrate the superiority of the SASS model over state-of-the-art methods. This model also achieves more than 8.0% improvement on Average Watching Time Per User in online A/B tests. ",

We build upon a recent method for nuclei tracking that combines weakly-supervised learning from a small set of nuclei center point annotations with an integer linear program (ILP) for optimal cell lineage extraction. Our work specifically addresses the following challenging properties of C. elegans embryo recordings: (1) Many cell divisions as compared to benchmark recordings of other organisms, and (2) the presence of polar bodies that are easily mistaken as cell nuclei. To cope with (1), we devise and incorporate a learnt cell division detector. To cope with (2), we employ a learnt polar body detector. We further propose automated ILP weights tuning via a structured SVM, alleviating the need for tedious manual set-up of a respective grid search. Our method outperforms the previous leader of the cell tracking challenge on the Fluo-N3DH-CE embryo dataset. We report a further extensive quantitative evaluation on two more C. elegans datasets. We will make these datasets public to serve as an extended benchmark for future method development. Our results suggest considerable improvements yielded by our method, especially in terms of the correctness of division event detection and the number and length of fully correct track segments.

It is basically scale invariant feature and is built on high-resolution pyramid feature map for small objects.

We demonstrate the proposed S2 feature can improve the performance of both one-stage and two-stage detectors on MS COCO dataset.

The proposed methodology identifies the hosting capacity of solar panels in the system while maintaining the resiliency under different unwanted conditions hence helps to obtain an optimal allocation topology for solar panels in the system. The proposed method also identifies the critical nodes that are highly sensitive to the changes and could drive the system into non-resiliency.

Estimating fruit counts before harvest provides useful information for logistics planning. While considerable progress has been made toward fruit detection, estimating the actual counts remains challenging. In practice, fruits are often clustered together. Therefore, methods that only detect fruits fail to offer general solutions to estimate accurate fruit counts. Furthermore, in horticultural studies, rather than a single yield estimate, finer information such as the distribution of the number of apples per cluster is desirable. In this work, we formulate fruit counting from images as a multi-class classification problem and solve it by training a Convolutional Neural Network. We first evaluate the per-image accuracy of our method and compare it with a state-of-the-art method based on Gaussian Mixture Models over four test datasets. Even though the parameters of the Gaussian Mixture Model-based method are specifically tuned for each dataset, our network outperforms it in three out of four datasets with a maximum of 94\\% accuracy. Next, we use the method to estimate the yield for two datasets for which we have ground truth. Our method achieved 96-97\\% accuracies.

    "abstract": "The Russian Invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 resulted in a rapidly changing (cyber) threat environment. This changing environment incentivized the sharing of security advice on social media, both for the Ukrainian population, as well as against Russian cyber attacks at large. Previous research found a significant influence of online security advice on end users. We collected 8,920 tweets posted after the Russian Invasion of Ukraine and examined 1,228 in detail, including qualitatively coding 232 relevant tweets and 140 linked documents for security and privacy advice. We identified 221 unique pieces of advice which we divided into seven categories and 21 subcategories, and advice targeted at individuals or organizations. We then compared our findings to those of prior studies, finding noteworthy similarities. Our results confirm a lack of advice prioritization found by prior work, which seems especially detrimental during times of crisis. In addition, we find offers for individual support to be a valuable tool and identify misinformation as a rising threat in general and for security advice specifically. ",

    "title": "Motion Robust High-Speed Light-weighted Object Detection with Event  Camera",
    "abstract": "The event camera produces a large dynamic range event stream with a very high temporal resolution discarding redundant visual information, thus bringing new possibilities for object detection tasks. However, the existing methods of applying the event camera to object detection tasks using deep learning methods still have many problems. First, existing methods cannot take into account objects with different velocities relative to the motion of the event camera due to the global synchronized time window and temporal resolution. Second, most of the existing methods rely on large parameter neural networks, which implies a large computational burden and low inference speed, thus contrary to the high temporal resolution of the event stream. In our work, we design a high-speed lightweight detector called Agile Event Detector (AED) with a simple but effective data augmentation method. Also, we propose an event stream representation tensor called Temporal Active Focus (TAF), which takes full advantage of the asynchronous generation of event stream data and is robust to the motion of moving objects. It can also be constructed without much time-consuming. We further propose a module called the Bifurcated Folding Module (BFM) to extract the rich temporal information in the TAF tensor at the input layer of the AED detector. We conduct our experiments on two typical real-scene event camera object detection datasets: the complete Prophesee GEN1 Automotive Detection Dataset and the Prophesee 1 MEGAPIXEL Automotive Detection Dataset with partial annotation. Experiments show that our method is competitive in terms of accuracy, speed, and the number of parameters simultaneously. Also by classifying the objects into multiple motion levels based on the optical flow density metric, we illustrated the robustness of our method for objects with different velocities relative to the camera.

Recent studies have proposed unrestricted adversarial attacks that are not norm-constrained. However, the previous unrestricted attack methods still have limitations to fool real-world applications in a black-box setting. In this paper, we present a novel method for generating unrestricted adversarial examples using GAN where an attacker can only access the top-1 final decision of a classification model. Our method, Latent-HSJA, efficiently leverages the advantages of a decision-based attack in the latent space and successfully manipulates the latent vectors for fooling the classification model. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method is efficient in evaluating the robustness of classification models with limited queries in a black-box setting. First, we demonstrate that our targeted attack method is query-efficient to produce unrestricted adversarial examples for a facial identity recognition model that contains 307 identities. Then, we demonstrate that the proposed method can also successfully attack a real-world celebrity recognition service. ",

By spectral analysis we mathematically show the effective of spectral regularization methods, and point out the linking between the spectral filtering result and the solution of the regularization optimization objective. For ill-posed problems like image deblurring, the optimization objective contains a regularization term (also called the regularization functional) that encodes our prior knowledge into the solution. We demonstrate how to craft a regularization term by hand using the idea of maximum a posterior estimation. Then, we point out the limitations of such regularization-based methods, and step into the neural-network based methods. Based on the idea of Wasserstein generative adversarial models, we can train a CNN to learn the regularization functional. Such data-driven approaches are able to capture the complexity, which may not be analytically modellable. Besides, in recent years with the improvement of architectures, the network has been able to output an image closely approximating the ground truth given the blurry observation. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) works on this Image-to-Image translation idea. We analyze the DeblurGAN-v2 method proposed by Orest Kupyn et al. [14] in 2019 based on numerical tests. And, based on the experimental results and our knowledge, we put forward some suggestions for improvement on this method. ",

    "abstract": "Object detection methods have witnessed impressive improvements in the last years thanks to the design of novel neural network architectures and the availability of large scale datasets. However, current methods have a significant limitation: they are able to detect only the classes observed during training time, that are only a subset of all the classes that a detector may encounter in the real world. Furthermore, the presence of unknown classes is often not considered at training time, resulting in methods not even able to detect that an unknown object is present in the image. In this work, we address the problem of detecting unknown objects, known as open-set object detection. We propose a novel training strategy, called UNKAD, able to predict unknown objects without requiring any annotation of them, exploiting non annotated objects that are already present in the background of training images. In particular, exploiting the four-steps training strategy of Faster R-CNN, UNKAD first identifies and pseudo-labels unknown objects and then uses the pseudo-annotations to train an additional unknown class. While UNKAD can directly detect unknown objects, we further combine it with previous unknown detection techniques, showing that it improves their performance at no costs. ",

In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework including two action recognition methods for lane change recognition, using video data collected by cameras. Our method achieves the best lane change classification results using only the RGB video data of the PREVENTION dataset. Class activation maps demonstrate that action recognition models can efficiently extract lane change motions. A method to better extract motion clues is also proposed in this paper. ",

According to how the triples will be treated independently or dependently, we divided the task of knowledge graph completion into conventional and graph neural network representation learning and we discuss them in more detail.

Therefore, designing feature representations robust to such point clouds is critical. Inspired by human associative recognition, we propose a novel 3D detection framework that associates intact features for objects via domain adaptation. We bridge the gap between the perceptual domain, where features are derived from real scenes with sub-optimal representations, and the conceptual domain, where features are extracted from augmented scenes that consist of non-occlusion objects with rich detailed information. A feasible method is investigated to construct conceptual scenes without external datasets. We further introduce an attention-based re-weighting module that adaptively strengthens the feature adaptation of more informative regions. The network's feature enhancement ability is exploited without introducing extra cost during inference, which is plug-and-play in various 3D detection frameworks. We achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI 3D detection benchmark in both accuracy and speed. Experiments on nuScenes and Waymo datasets also validate the versatility of our method. ",

    "abstract": "Binary analyses based on deep neural networks (DNNs), or neural binary analyses (NBAs), have become a hotly researched topic in recent years. DNNs have been wildly successful at pushing the performance and accuracy envelopes in the natural language and image processing domains. Thus, DNNs are highly promising for solving binary analysis problems that are typically hard due to a lack of complete information resulting from the lossy compilation process. Despite this promise, it is unclear that the prevailing strategy of repurposing embeddings and model architectures originally developed for other problem domains is sound given the adversarial contexts under which binary analysis often operates. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that the current state of the art in neural function boundary detection is vulnerable to both inadvertent and deliberate adversarial attacks. We proceed from the insight that current generation NBAs are built upon embeddings and model architectures intended to solve syntactic problems. We devise a simple, reproducible, and scalable black-box methodology for exploring the space of inadvertent attacks - instruction sequences that could be emitted by common compiler toolchains and configurations - that exploits this syntactic design focus. We then show that these inadvertent misclassifications can be exploited by an attacker, serving as the basis for a highly effective black-box adversarial example generation process. We evaluate this methodology against two state-of-the-art neural function boundary detectors: XDA and DeepDi. We conclude with an analysis of the evaluation data and recommendations for how future research might avoid succumbing to similar attacks. ",

    "abstract": "In a recent work, we studied a novel precoding design for cell-free networks called team minimum mean-square error (TMMSE) precoding, which rigorously generalizes centralized MMSE precoding to distributed operations based on transmitter-specific channel state information (CSI). Despite its flexibility in handling different cooperation regimes at the CSI sharing level, TMMSE precoding assumes network-wide sharing of the data bearing signals, and hence it is inherently not scalable. In this work, inspired by recent advances on scalable cell-free architectures based on user-centric network clustering techniques, we address this issue by proposing a novel version of the TMMSE precoding design covering partial message sharing. The obtained framework is then successfully applied to derive a variety of novel, optimal, and efficient precoding schemes for a user-centric cell-free network deployed using multiple radio stripes. Numerical simulations of a typical industrial internet-of-things scenario corroborate the gains of TMMSE precoding over competing schemes in terms of spectral efficiency under different power constraints. Although presented in the context of downlink precoding, the results of this paper may be applied also on the uplink. ",

The partitioning was validated using graph neural network architecture for suitable formation of the microgrids. Further, using an effective measurable causality analysis like granger causality, we identified critical nodes in the partitioned microgrid and placement of DERs on these nodes resulted in enhanced network reliability and resiliency. Further, to validate the system performance and energy resiliency, we computed percolation threshold for the microgrid network that indicates the system resiliency after incorporating DERs at those critical nodes. This proposed methodology for the first ensures effective microgrid partitioning, identification of critical nodes, optimal DERs allocation and system resiliency evaluation through data driven analysis approach in a distribution network.

A suitable model can be difficult to determine when the spatial domain of interest is large compared to the wavelength or when spherical and planar wavefronts are present or the sound field is complex, as in the near-field. To span such complex sound fields, the global reconstruction task can be partitioned into local subdomain problems. Previous studies have shown that partitioning approaches rely on sufficient measurements within each domain, due to the higher number of model coefficients. This study proposes a joint analysis of all local subdomains, while enforcing self-similarity between neighbouring partitions. More specifically, the coefficients of local plane wave representations are sought to have spatially smooth magnitudes. A convolutional model of the sound field in terms of plane wave filters is formulated and the inverse reconstruction problem is solved via the alternating direction method of multipliers. The experiments on simulated and measured sound fields suggest, that the proposed method both retains the flexibility of local models to conform to complex sound fields and also preserves the global structure to reconstruct from fewer measurements.

This structure often leads to redundancy of the information, poor scalability with the network size, communication and memory overhead. In this paper, we develop a framework for the design and analysis of distributed algorithms, named END, to systematically assign local copies only to a subset of the agents, while still ensuring consistency. END unifies and generalizes several existing (application-specific) approaches, and leverages the original sparsity of the problem to improve efficiency and minimize redundancy.

Thus, it is pertinent that medical professionals who interpret these scans reduce the risk of human error by using computer-aided detection systems. The variety of algorithms used in system implementation, however, has yielded mixed results. Here we investigate the best machine learning classifier for each prostate zone. We also discover salient features to clarify the models' classification rationale. Of the data provided, we gathered and augmented T2 weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient map images to extract first through third order statistical features as input to machine learning classifiers. For our deep learning classifier, we used a convolutional neural net (CNN) architecture for automatic feature extraction and classification. The interpretability of the CNN results was improved by saliency mapping to understand the classification mechanisms within. Ultimately, we concluded that effective detection of peripheral and anterior fibromuscular stroma (AS) lesions depended more on statistical distribution features, whereas those in the transition zone (TZ) depended more on textural features. Ensemble algorithms worked best for PZ and TZ zones, while CNNs were best in the AS zone. These classifiers can be used to validate a radiologist's predictions and reduce inter-reader variability in patients suspected to have prostate cancer. The salient features reported in this study can also be investigated further to better understand hidden features and biomarkers of prostate lesions with mpMRIs. ",

We further investigate the model performance with reduced labeled training data (down to 10 percent) to test the robustness of the model when trained with small, labeled datasets. The model is trained and validated on the EyePACS dataset and tested independently on clinical data from the University of Illinois, Chicago (UIC). Compared to baseline models, our CL pretrained FundusNet model had higher AUC (CI) values (0.91 (0.898 to 0.930) vs 0.80 (0.783 to 0.820) and 0.83 (0.801 to 0.853) on UIC data).

CL based pretraining with NST significantly improves DL classification performance, helps the model generalize well (transferable from EyePACS to UIC data), and allows training with small, annotated datasets, therefore reducing ground truth annotation burden of the clinicians.

    "title": "Indirect social learning through collective performance favors  decentralization",
    "abstract": "Many models of learning in teams assume that team members can share solutions or learn concurrently. These assumptions break down in multi-disciplinary teams where team members tend to complete distinct, interrelated pieces of larger tasks. Such contexts make it difficult for individuals to separate the performance effects of their own actions from the actions of interacting neighbors. In this work, we show that individuals can also learn indirectly from network neighbors. In this context, individuals in dense networks tend to perform better when refining their work (through \"exploiting\" searches) by efficiently finding local optima. However when individuals innovate (through \"exploring\" searches), dense networks hurt performance by increasing uncertainty. We also find that decentralization improves team performance across a wide variety of tasks. Our results offer new design principles for multi-disciplinary teams where direct learning is not realistic or possible. ",
