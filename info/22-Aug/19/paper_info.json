    "title": "Performance Evaluation of Selective Fixed-filter Active Noise Control  based on Different Convolutional Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Due to its rapid response time and a high degree of robustness, the selective fixed-filter active noise control (SFANC) method appears to be a viable candidate for widespread use in a variety of practical active noise control (ANC) systems. In comparison to conventional fixed-filter ANC methods, SFANC can select the pre-trained control filters for different types of noise. Deep learning technologies, thus, can be used in SFANC methods to enable a more flexible selection of the most appropriate control filters for attenuating various noises. Furthermore, with the assistance of a deep neural network, the selecting strategy can be learned automatically from noise data rather than through trial and error, which significantly simplifies and improves the practicability of ANC design. Therefore, this paper investigates the performance of SFANC based on different one-dimensional and two-dimensional convolutional neural networks. Additionally, we conducted comparative analyses of several network training strategies and discovered that fine-tuning could improve selection performance. ",

    "abstract": "In supervised machine learning, use of correct labels is extremely important to ensure high accuracy. Unfortunately, most datasets contain corrupted labels. Machine learning models trained on such datasets do not generalize well. Thus, detecting their label errors can significantly increase their efficacy. We propose a novel framework, called CTRL (Clustering TRaining Losses for label error detection), to detect label errors in multi-class datasets. It detects label errors in two steps based on the observation that models learn clean and noisy labels in different ways. First, we train a neural network using the noisy training dataset and obtain the loss curve for each sample. Then, we apply clustering algorithms to the training losses to group samples into two categories: cleanly-labeled and noisily-labeled. After label error detection, we remove samples with noisy labels and retrain the model. Our experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art error detection accuracy on both image (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) and tabular datasets under simulated noise. We also use a theoretical analysis to provide insights into why CTRL performs so well. ",

    "abstract": "The effective representation, precessing, analysis, and visualization of large-scale structured data over graphs are gaining a lot of attention. So far most of the literature has focused on real-valued signals. However, signals are often sparse in the Fourier domain, and more informative and compact representations for them can be obtained using the complex envelope of their spectral components, as opposed to the original real-valued signals. Motivated by this fact, in this work we generalize graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) to the complex domain, deriving the theory that allows to incorporate a complex-valued graph shift operators (GSO) in the definition of graph filters (GF) and process complex-valued graph signals (GS). The theory developed can handle spatio-temporal complex network processes. We prove that complex-valued GCNs are stable with respect to perturbations of the underlying graph support, the bound of the transfer error and the bound of error propagation through multiply layers. Then we apply complex GCN to power grid state forecasting, power grid cyber-attack detection and localization. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has received a surge of interest in recent years thanks to its benefits in data privacy protection, efficient communication, and parallel data processing. Also, with appropriate algorithmic designs, one could achieve the desirable linear speedup for convergence effect in FL. However, most existing works on FL are limited to systems with i.i.d. data and centralized parameter servers and results on decentralized FL with heterogeneous datasets remains limited. Moreover, whether or not the linear speedup for convergence is achievable under fully decentralized FL with data heterogeneity remains an open question. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a new algorithm, called NET-FLEET, for fully decentralized FL systems with data heterogeneity. The key idea of our algorithm is to enhance the local update scheme in FL (originally intended for communication efficiency) by incorporating a recursive gradient correction technique to handle heterogeneous datasets. We show that, under appropriate parameter settings, the proposed NET-FLEET algorithm achieves a linear speedup for convergence. We further conduct extensive numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed NET-FLEET algorithm and verify our theoretical findings. ",

Real life data in machine learning is usually very noisy and almost never clean, which can be attributed to various factors depending on the domain, e.g. outliers, random noise and adversarial noise. Therefore, the models we develop for various tasks should be robust to such kinds of noisy data, which led to the thriving field of robust machine learning. We consider this important issue in the setting of automatic speech recognition. With the increasing popularity of pre-trained models, it's an important question to analyze and understand the robustness of such models to noise. In this work, we perform a robustness analysis of the pre-trained neural models wav2vec2, HuBERT and DistilHuBERT on the LibriSpeech and TIMIT datasets. We use different kinds of noising mechanisms and measure the model performances as quantified by the inference time and the standard Word Error Rate metric. We also do an in-depth layer-wise analysis of the wav2vec2 model when injecting noise in between layers, enabling us to predict at a high level what each layer learns. Finally for this model, we visualize the propagation of errors across the layers and compare how it behaves on clean versus noisy data. Our experiments conform the predictions of Pasad et al.

First, we propose RAN-explicit (RAN-e) -- a new hardware-aware search space and a semi-automatic search algorithm -- to replace inefficient blocks with hardware-aware blocks. Next, we propose a training-free model scaling method called RAN-implicit (RAN-i) where we theoretically prove the link between network topology and its expressivity in terms of number of non-linear units. We demonstrate that our networks achieve state-of-the-art results on ImageNet at different scales and for several types of hardware. For example, compared to EfficientNet-Lite-B0, RAN-e achieves a similar accuracy while improving Frames-Per-Second (FPS) by 1.5x on Arm micro-NPUs. On the other hand, RAN-i demonstrates up to 2x reduction in #MACs over ConvNexts with a similar or better accuracy. We also show that RAN-i achieves nearly 40% higher FPS than ConvNext on Arm-based datacenter CPUs. Finally, RAN-i based object detection networks achieve a similar or higher mAP and up to 33% higher FPS on datacenter CPUs compared to ConvNext based models. ",

As a defense, architecture obfuscation is proposed to remap the victim DNN to a different architecture. Nonetheless, we observe that, with only extracting an obfuscated DNN architecture, the adversary can still retrain a substitute model with high performance (e.g., accuracy), rendering the obfuscation techniques ineffective. To mitigate this under-explored vulnerability, we propose ObfuNAS, which converts the DNN architecture obfuscation into a neural architecture search (NAS) problem. Using a combination of function-preserving obfuscation strategies, ObfuNAS ensures that the obfuscated DNN architecture can only achieve lower accuracy than the victim. We validate the performance of ObfuNAS with open-source architecture datasets like NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-301. The experimental results demonstrate that ObfuNAS can successfully find the optimal mask for a victim model within a given FLOPs constraint, leading up to 2.6% inference accuracy degradation for attackers with only 0.14x FLOPs overhead.

However, in this paper, we uncover an ever-overlooked phenomenon: the pre-trained graph representation learning model tested with full graphs underperforms the model tested with well-pruned graphs. This observation reveals that there exist confounders in graphs, which may interfere with the model learning semantic information, and current graph representation learning methods have not eliminated their influence. To tackle this issue, we propose Robust Causal Graph Representation Learning (RCGRL) to learn robust graph representations against confounding effects. RCGRL introduces an active approach to generate instrumental variables under unconditional moment restrictions, which empowers the graph representation learning model to eliminate confounders, thereby capturing discriminative information that is causally related to downstream predictions. We offer theorems and proofs to guarantee the theoretical effectiveness of the proposed approach. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and multiple benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that compared with state-of-the-art methods, RCGRL achieves better prediction performance and generalization ability. ",

This paper presents a new general video restoration framework for the restoration of user videos shared on social media platforms. In contrast to most deep learning-based video restoration methods that perform end-to-end mapping, where feature extraction is mostly treated as a black box, in the sense that what role a feature plays is often unknown, our new method, termed Video restOration through adapTive dEgradation Sensing (VOTES), introduces the concept of a degradation feature map (DFM) to explicitly guide the video restoration process. Specifically, for each video frame, we first adaptively estimate its DFM to extract features representing the difficulty of restoring its different regions. We then feed the DFM to a convolutional neural network (CNN) to compute hierarchical degradation features to modulate an end-to-end video restoration backbone network, such that more attention is paid explicitly to potentially more difficult to restore areas, which in turn leads to enhanced restoration performance. We will explain the design rationale of the VOTES framework and present extensive experimental results to show that the new VOTES method outperforms various state-of-the-art techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively.

    "abstract": "It's common for current methods in skeleton-based action recognition to mainly consider capturing long-term temporal dependencies as skeleton sequences are typically long (>128 frames), which forms a challenging problem for previous approaches. In such conditions, short-term dependencies are few formally considered, which are critical for classifying similar actions. Most current approaches are consisted of interleaving spatial-only modules and temporal-only modules, where direct information flow among joints in adjacent frames are hindered, thus inferior to capture short-term motion and distinguish similar action pairs. To handle this limitation, we propose a general framework, coined as STGAT, to model cross-spacetime information flow. It equips the spatial-only modules with spatial-temporal modeling for regional perception. While STGAT is theoretically effective for spatial-temporal modeling, we propose three simple modules to reduce local spatial-temporal feature redundancy and further release the potential of STGAT, which (1) narrow the scope of self-attention mechanism, (2) dynamically weight joints along temporal dimension, and (3) separate subtle motion from static features, respectively. As a robust feature extractor, STGAT generalizes better upon classifying similar actions than previous methods, witnessed by both qualitative and quantitative results. STGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale datasets: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and Kinetics Skeleton 400. Code is released. ",

To achieve acceleration for data-intensive and sparse graph computing, ASICs such as GCNAX have been proposed for efficient execution of aggregation and combination in GCN. GCNAX reducing 8x DRAM accesses compared with previous efforts. However, as graphs have reached terabytes in size, off-chip data movement from SSD to DRAM becomes a serious latency bottleneck. This paper proposes Compressive Graph Transmission (CGTrans), which performs the aggregation in SSD to dramatically relieves the transfer latency bottleneck due to SSD loading compared to CMOS-based graph accelerator ASICs. InSSD computing technique is required for CGTrans. Recently, Insider was proposed as a near-SSD processing system computing by integrating FPGA in SSD. However, the Insider still suffers low area efficiency, which will limit the performance of CGTrans. The recently proposed Fully Concurrent Access Technique (FAST) is utilized. FAST-GAS, as an in-SSD graph computing accelerator, is proposed to provide high-concurrent gather-andscatter operations to overcome the area efficiency problem. We proposed the GRAPHIC system containing CGTrans dataflow deployed on FAST-GAS.

To handle the problem of backhaul bottleneck in cellular network and satisfy people's requirements about latency, the network architecture like information-centric network (ICN) intends to proactively keep limited popular content at the edge of network based on predicted results. Meanwhile, the interactions between the content (e.g., deep neural network models, Wikipedia-alike knowledge base) and users could be regarded as a dynamic bipartite graph. In this paper, to maximize the cache hit rate, we leverage an effective dynamic graph neural network (DGNN) to jointly learn the structural and temporal patterns embedded in the bipartite graph. Furthermore, in order to have deeper insights into the dynamics within the evolving graph, we propose an age of information (AoI) based attention mechanism to extract valuable historical information while avoiding the problem of message staleness. Combining this aforementioned prediction model, we also develop a cache selection algorithm to make caching decisions in accordance with the prediction results. Extensive results demonstrate that our model can obtain a higher prediction accuracy than other state-of-the-art schemes in two real-world datasets. The results of hit rate further verify the superiority of the caching policy based on our proposed model over other traditional ways. ",

In the recent years, it was established that Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) have an equivalent representation in Boolean logic and can be formally analyzed using logical reasoning tools such as SAT solvers. However, to date, only BNNs can be transformed into a SAT formula. In this work, we introduce Truth Table Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (TTnets), a new family of SAT-encodable models featuring for the first time real-valued weights. Furthermore, it admits, by construction, some valuable conversion features including post-tuning and tractability in the robustness verification setting. The latter property leads to a more compact SAT symbolic encoding than BNNs. This enables the use of general SAT solvers, making property verification easier. We demonstrate the value of TTnets regarding the formal robustness property: TTnets outperform the verified accuracy of all BNNs with a comparable computation time. More generally, they represent a relevant trade-off between all known complete verification methods: TTnets achieve high verified accuracy with fast verification time, being complete with no timeouts. We are exploring here a proof of concept of TTnets for a very important application (complete verification of robustness) and we believe this novel real-valued network constitutes a practical response to the rising need for functional formal verification. We postulate that TTnets can apply to various CNN-based architectures and be extended to other properties such as fairness, fault attack and exact rule extraction. ",

    "abstract": "Recent progress in 4D implicit representation focuses on globally controlling the shape and motion with low dimensional latent vectors, which is prone to missing surface details and accumulating tracking error. While many deep local representations have shown promising results for 3D shape modeling, their 4D counterpart does not exist yet. In this paper, we fill this blank by proposing a novel Local 4D implicit Representation for Dynamic clothed human, named LoRD, which has the merits of both 4D human modeling and local representation, and enables high-fidelity reconstruction with detailed surface deformations, such as clothing wrinkles. Particularly, our key insight is to encourage the network to learn the latent codes of local part-level representation, capable of explaining the local geometry and temporal deformations. To make the inference at test-time, we first estimate the inner body skeleton motion to track local parts at each time step, and then optimize the latent codes for each part via auto-decoding based on different types of observed data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method has strong capability for representing 4D human, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on practical applications, including 4D reconstruction from sparse points, non-rigid depth fusion, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

    "abstract": "In this work, we identify open research opportunities in applying Neural Temporal Point Process (NTPP) models to industry scale customer behavior data by carefully reproducing NTPP models published up to date on known literature benchmarks as well as applying NTPP models to a novel, real world consumer behavior dataset that is twice as large as the largest publicly available NTPP benchmark. We identify the following challenges. First, NTPP models, albeit their generative nature, remain vulnerable to dataset imbalances and cannot forecast rare events. Second, NTPP models based on stochastic differential equations, despite their theoretical appeal and leading performance on literature benchmarks, do not scale easily to large industry-scale data. The former is in light of previously made observations on deep generative models. Additionally, to combat a cold-start problem, we explore a novel addition to NTPP models - a parametrization based on static user features. ",

As an example of a parabolic problem, we consider the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) with a point (Gaussian) source initial condition. In the $d$-dimensional ADE, perturbations in the initial condition decay with time $t$ as $t^{-d/2}$, which can cause a large approximation error in the PINN solution. Localized large gradients in the ADE solution make the (common in PINN) Latin hypercube sampling of the equation's residual highly inefficient. Finally, the PINN solution of parabolic equations is sensitive to the choice of weights in the loss function. We propose a normalized form of ADE where the initial perturbation of the solution does not decrease in amplitude and demonstrate that this normalization significantly reduces the PINN approximation error. We propose criteria for weights in the loss function that produce a more accurate PINN solution than those obtained with the weights selected via other methods. Finally, we proposed an adaptive sampling scheme that significantly reduces the PINN solution error for the same number of the sampling (residual) points. We demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed PINN model for forward, inverse, and backward ADEs. ",

However, long-term/global dependencies widely exist in programs, and most of these neural architectures fail to capture these dependencies. In this paper, we propose Tree-Transformer, a novel recursive tree-structured neural network which aims to overcome the above limitations. Tree-Transformer leverages two multi-head attention units to model the dependency between siblings and parent-children node pairs. Moreover, we propose a bi-directional propagation strategy to allow node information passing in two directions: bottom-up and top-down along trees. By combining bottom-up and top-down propagation, Tree-Transformer can learn both global contexts and meaningful node features. The extensive experimental results show that our Tree-Transformer outperforms existing tree-based or graph-based neural networks in program-related tasks with tree-level and node-level prediction tasks, indicating that Tree-Transformer performs well on learning both tree-level and node-level representations.

In this paper, we extend the classic GAN setup with an external memory to replay features from real samples.

    "abstract": "Secure multi-party computation-based machine learning, referred to as MPL, has become an important technology to utilize data from multiple parties with privacy preservation. While MPL provides rigorous security guarantees for the computation process, the models trained by MPL are still vulnerable to attacks that solely depend on access to the models. Differential privacy could help to defend against such attacks. However, the accuracy loss brought by differential privacy and the huge communication overhead of secure multi-party computation protocols make it highly challenging to balance the 3-way trade-off between privacy, efficiency, and accuracy. In this paper, we are motivated to resolve the above issue by proposing a solution, referred to as PEA (Private, Efficient, Accurate), which consists of a secure DPSGD protocol and two optimization methods. First, we propose a secure DPSGD protocol to enforce DPSGD in secret sharing-based MPL frameworks. Second, to reduce the accuracy loss led by differential privacy noise and the huge communication overhead of MPL, we propose two optimization methods for the training process of MPL: (1) the data-independent feature extraction method, which aims to simplify the trained model structure; (2) the local data-based global model initialization method, which aims to speed up the convergence of the model training. We implement PEA in two open-source MPL frameworks: TF-Encrypted and Queqiao. The experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of PEA. E.g. when ${\\epsilon}$ = 2, we can train a differentially private classification model with an accuracy of 88% for CIFAR-10 within 7 minutes under the LAN setting. This result significantly outperforms the one from CryptGPU, one SOTA MPL framework: it costs more than 16 hours to train a non-private deep neural network model on CIFAR-10 with the same accuracy.

In order to obtain class-conditional generation, it was suggested to guide the diffusion process by gradients from a time-dependent classifier. While the idea is theoretically sound, deep learning-based classifiers are infamously susceptible to gradient-based adversarial attacks. Therefore, while traditional classifiers may achieve good accuracy scores, their gradients are possibly unreliable and might hinder the improvement of the generation results. Recent work discovered that adversarially robust classifiers exhibit gradients that are aligned with human perception, and these could better guide a generative process towards semantically meaningful images. We utilize this observation by defining and training a time-dependent adversarially robust classifier and use it as guidance for a generative diffusion model. In experiments on the highly challenging and diverse ImageNet dataset, our scheme introduces significantly more intelligible intermediate gradients, better alignment with theoretical findings, as well as improved generation results under several evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we conduct an opinion survey whose findings indicate that human raters prefer our method's results. ",

    "abstract": "Modern privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), address privacy in software systems in a technologically agnostic way by mentioning general \"technical measures\" for data privacy compliance rather than dictating how these should be implemented. An understanding of the concept of technical measures and how exactly these can be handled in practice, however, is not trivial due to its interdisciplinary nature and the necessary technical-legal interactions. We aim to investigate how the concept of technical measures for data privacy compliance is understood in practice as well as the technical-legal interaction intrinsic to the process of implementing those technical measures. We follow a research design that is 1) exploratory in nature, 2) qualitative, and 3) interview-based, with 16 selected privacy professionals in the technical and legal domains. Our results suggest that there is no clear mutual understanding and commonly accepted approach to handling technical measures. Both technical and legal roles are involved in the implementation of such measures. While they still often operate in separate spheres, a predominant opinion amongst the interviewees is to promote more interdisciplinary collaboration. Our empirical findings confirm the need for better interaction between legal and engineering teams when implementing technical measures for data privacy. We posit that interdisciplinary collaboration is paramount to a more complete understanding of technical measures, which currently lacks a mutually accepted notion. Yet, as strongly suggested by our results, there is still a lack of systematic approaches to such interaction. Therefore, the results strengthen our confidence in the need for further investigations into the technical-legal dynamic of data privacy compliance. ",

Achieving high classification accuracy with a limited amount of labeled information in an image is one of the key challenges that researchers have started addressing in recent years. We propose a novel graph-regularized neural network (GRNN) algorithm that encompasses the superpixel-based segmentation for graph construction, a pixel-wise neural network classifier, and the label propagation technique to generate an accurate classification map. GRNN outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques not only for the standard Indian Pines HSI but also achieves a high classification accuracy (approx. 92%) on a new HSI data set collected over the forests of French Guiana (FG) even when less than 1% of the pixels are labeled. We show that GRNN is not only competitive with the state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, but also exhibits lower variance in accuracy for different number of training samples and over different independent random sampling of the labeled pixels for training.

However, existing methods fall short under the more challenging scenario of creating targeted attacks transferable among distinct models. In this work, we propose Diversified Weight Pruning (DWP) to further enhance the ensemble-based methods by leveraging the weight pruning method commonly used in model compression. Specifically, we obtain multiple diverse models by a random weight pruning method. These models preserve similar accuracies and can serve as additional models for ensemble-based methods, yielding stronger transferable targeted attacks. Experiments on ImageNet-Compatible Dataset under the more challenging scenarios are provided: transferring to distinct architectures and to adversarially trained models.

Despite overwhelming promises, the deep learning systems are vulnerable to crafted adversarial examples, which may be imperceptible to the human eye, but can lead the model to misclassify. Protections against adversarial perturbations on ensemble-based techniques have either been shown to be vulnerable to stronger adversaries or shown to lack an end-to-end evaluation. In this paper, we attempt to develop a new ensemble-based solution that constructs defender models with diverse decision boundaries with respect to the original model. The ensemble of classifiers constructed by (1) transformation of the input by a method called Split-and-Shuffle, and (2) restricting the significant features by a method called Contrast-Significant-Features are shown to result in diverse gradients with respect to adversarial attacks, which reduces the chance of transferring adversarial examples from the original to the defender model targeting the same class. We present extensive experimentations using standard image classification datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 against state-of-the-art adversarial attacks to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed ensemble-based defense. We also evaluate the robustness in the presence of a stronger adversary targeting all the models within the ensemble simultaneously.

It states that an agent will attempt to minimize its variational free energy, defined in terms of beliefs over observations, internal states and policies. Traditionally, every aspect of a discrete active inference model must be specified by hand, i.e.\\ by manually defining the hidden state space structure, as well as the required distributions such as likelihood and transition probabilities. Recently, efforts have been made to learn state space representations automatically from observations using deep neural networks. However, these models are typically overparameterized, with the risk of overfitting the data at hand. In this paper, we present a novel approach of learning state spaces using quantum physics-inspired tensor networks. The ability of tensor networks to represent the probabilistic nature of quantum states as well as to reduce large state spaces makes tensor networks a natural candidate for active inference. We show how tensor networks can be used as a generative model for sequential data. Furthermore, we show how one can obtain beliefs from such a generative model and how an active inference agent can use these to compute the expected free energy. Finally, we demonstrate our method on the classic T-maze environment. ",

Our method is based on a dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) rigged by a mesh-based parametric 3D human model serving as a geometry proxy. Previous methods usually rely on multi-view videos or accurate 3D geometry information as additional inputs; besides, most methods suffer from degraded quality when generalized to unseen poses. We identify that the key to generalization is a good input embedding for querying dynamic NeRF: A good input embedding should define an injective mapping in the full volumetric space, guided by surface mesh deformation under pose variation. Based on this observation, we propose to embed the input query with its relationship to local surface regions spanned by a set of geodesic nearest neighbors on mesh vertices. By including both position and relative distance information, our embedding defines a distance-preserved deformation mapping and generalizes well to unseen poses. To reduce the dependency on additional inputs, we first initialize per-frame 3D meshes using off-the-shelf tools and then propose a pipeline to jointly optimize NeRF and refine the initial mesh. Extensive experiments show our method can synthesize plausible human rendering results under unseen poses and views. ",

The performance of generic object detectors tends to drastically deteriorate on tiny object detection tasks. In this paper, we point out that either box prior in the anchor-based detector or point prior in the anchor-free detector is sub-optimal for tiny objects. Our key observation is that the current anchor-based or anchor-free label assignment paradigms will incur many outlier tiny-sized ground truth samples, leading to detectors imposing less focus on the tiny objects. To this end, we propose a Gaussian Receptive Field based Label Assignment (RFLA) strategy for tiny object detection. Specifically, RFLA first utilizes the prior information that the feature receptive field follows Gaussian distribution. Then, instead of assigning samples with IoU or center sampling strategy, a new Receptive Field Distance (RFD) is proposed to directly measure the similarity between the Gaussian receptive field and ground truth. Considering that the IoU-threshold based and center sampling strategy are skewed to large objects, we further design a Hierarchical Label Assignment (HLA) module based on RFD to achieve balanced learning for tiny objects. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing 3D human body shapes from 3D partial textured scans remains a fundamental task for many computer vision and graphics applications -- e.g., body animation, and virtual dressing. We propose a new neural network architecture for 3D body shape and high-resolution texture completion -- BCom-Net -- that can reconstruct the full geometry from mid-level to high-level partial input scans. We decompose the overall reconstruction task into two stages - first, a joint implicit learning network (SCom-Net and TCom-Net) that takes a voxelized scan and its occupancy grid as input to reconstruct the full body shape and predict vertex textures. Second, a high-resolution texture completion network, that utilizes the predicted coarse vertex textures to inpaint the missing parts of the partial 'texture atlas'. A Thorough experimental evaluation on 3DBodyTex.V2 dataset shows that our method achieves competitive results with respect to the state-of-the-art while generalizing to different types and levels of partial shapes. The proposed method has also ranked second in the SHARP 2022 Challenge1-Track1. ",

Based on previous work in computer vision on image inpainting, this paper shows how three-dimensional spatiotemporal partial convolutions can be used as layers in neural networks to fill gaps in satellite image time series. To evaluate the approach, we apply a U-Net-like model on incomplete image time series of quasi-global carbon monoxide observations from the Sentinel-5P satellite. Prediction errors were comparable to two considered statistical approaches while computation times for predictions were up to three orders of magnitude faster, making the approach applicable to process large amounts of satellite data. Partial convolutions can be added as layers to other types of neural networks, making it relatively easy to integrate with existing deep learning models. However, the approach does not quantify prediction errors and further research is needed to understand and improve model transferability. The implementation of spatiotemporal partial convolutions and the U-Net-like model is available as open-source software. ",

    "abstract": "Histopathological images contain abundant phenotypic information and pathological patterns, which are the gold standards for disease diagnosis and essential for the prediction of patient prognosis and treatment outcome. In recent years, computer-automated analysis techniques for histopathological images have been urgently required in clinical practice, and deep learning methods represented by convolutional neural networks have gradually become the mainstream in the field of digital pathology. However, obtaining large numbers of fine-grained annotated data in this field is a very expensive and difficult task, which hinders the further development of traditional supervised algorithms based on large numbers of annotated data. More recent studies have started to liberate from the traditional supervised paradigm, and the most representative ones are the studies on weakly supervised learning paradigm based on weak annotation, semi-supervised learning paradigm based on limited annotation, and self-supervised learning paradigm based on pathological image representation learning. These new methods have led a new wave of automatic pathological image diagnosis and analysis targeted at annotation efficiency. With a survey of over 130 papers, we present a comprehensive and systematic review of the latest studies on weakly supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and self-supervised learning in the field of computational pathology from both technical and methodological perspectives. Finally, we present the key challenges and future trends for these techniques. ",

    "abstract": "Lattices are a popular field of study in mathematical research, but also in more practical areas like cryptology or multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) transmission. In mathematical theory, most often lattices over real numbers are considered. However, in communications, complex-valued processing is usually of interest. Besides, by the use of dual-polarized transmission as well as by the combination of two time slots or frequencies, four-dimensional (quaternion-valued) approaches become more and more important. Hence, to account for this fact, well-known lattice algorithms and related concepts are generalized in this work. To this end, a brief review of complex arithmetic, including the sets of Gaussian and Eisenstein integers, and an introduction to quaternion-valued numbers, including the sets of Lipschitz and Hurwitz integers, are given. On that basis, generalized variants of two important algorithms are derived: first, of the polynomial-time LLL algorithm, resulting in a reduced basis of a lattice by performing a special variant of the Euclidean algorithm defined for matrices, and second, of an algorithm to calculate the successive minima - the norms of the shortest independent vectors of a lattice - and its related lattice points. Generalized bounds for the quality of the particular results are established and the asymptotic complexities of the algorithms are assessed. These findings are extensively compared to conventional real-valued processing. It is shown that the generalized approaches outperform their real-valued counterparts in complexity and/or quality aspects. Moreover, the application of the generalized algorithms to MIMO communications is studied, particularly in the field of lattice-reduction-aided and integer-forcing equalization. ",

Cooperative game theory offers solution concepts identifying distribution schemes, such as the Shapley value, that fairly reflect the contribution of individuals to the performance of the team or the Core, which reduces the incentive of agents to abandon their team. Applications of such methods include identifying influential features and sharing the costs of joint ventures or team formation. Unfortunately, using these solutions requires tackling a computational barrier as they are hard to compute, even in restricted settings. In this work, we show how cooperative game-theoretic solutions can be distilled into a learned model by training neural networks to propose fair and stable payoff allocations. We show that our approach creates models that can generalize to games far from the training distribution and can predict solutions for more players than observed during training.

It is a crucial component of active defense against advanced persistent threats (APTs). However, most of the current threat hunting methods rely on Cyber Threat Intelligence(CTI), which can find known attacks but cannot find unknown attacks that have not been disclosed by CTI. In this paper, we propose LogKernel, a threat hunting method based on graph kernel clustering which can effectively separates attack behaviour from benign activities. LogKernel first abstracts system audit logs into Behaviour Provenance Graphs (BPGs), and then clusters graphs by embedding them into a continuous space using a graph kernel. In particular, we design a new graph kernel clustering method based on the characteristics of BPGs, which can capture structure information and rich label information of the BPGs. To reduce false positives, LogKernel further quantifies the threat of abnormal behaviour. We evaluate LogKernel on the malicious dataset which includes seven simulated attack scenarios and the DAPRA CADETS dataset which includes four attack scenarios. The result shows that LogKernel can hunt all attack scenarios among them, and compared to the state-of-the-art methods, it can find unknown attacks. ",

However, little attention was paid to GNN's vulnerability to exposure bias: users are exposed to a limited number of items so that a system only learns a biased view of user preference to result in suboptimal recommendation quality. Although inverse propensity weighting is known to recognize and alleviate exposure bias, it usually works on the final objective with the model outputs, whereas GNN can also be biased during neighbor aggregation. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective approach, neighbor aggregation via inverse propensity (Navip) for GNNs. Specifically, given a user-item bipartite graph, we first derive propensity score of each user-item interaction in the graph. Then, inverse of the propensity score with Laplacian normalization is applied to debias neighbor aggregation from exposure bias. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through our extensive experiments on two public and Amazon Alexa datasets where the performance enhances up to 14.2%. ",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal and neurological disorders are the most common causes of walking problems among older people, and they often lead to diminished quality of life. Analyzing walking motion data manually requires trained professionals and the evaluations may not always be objective. To facilitate early diagnosis, recent deep learning-based methods have shown promising results for automated analysis, which can discover patterns that have not been found in traditional machine learning methods. We observe that existing work mostly applies deep learning on individual joint features such as the time series of joint positions. Due to the challenge of discovering inter-joint features such as the distance between feet (i.e. the stride width) from generally smaller-scale medical datasets, these methods usually perform sub-optimally. As a result, we propose a solution that explicitly takes both individual joint features and inter-joint features as input, relieving the system from the need of discovering more complicated features from small data. Due to the distinctive nature of the two types of features, we introduce a two-stream framework, with one stream learning from the time series of joint position and the other from the time series of relative joint displacement. We further develop a mid-layer fusion module to combine the discovered patterns in these two streams for diagnosis, which results in a complementary representation of the data for better prediction performance. We validate our system with a benchmark dataset of 3D skeleton motion that involves 45 patients with musculoskeletal and neurological disorders, and achieve a prediction accuracy of 95.56%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

The control law unites the time delayed estimation (TDE) framework with a second order switching controller of super twisting algorithm (STA) type via a novel generalized filtered tracking error (GFTE). While time delayed estimation framework eliminates the need for accurate modelling of robot dynamics by estimating the uncertain robot dynamics and interaction forces from immediate past data of state and control effort, the second order switching control law in the outer loop provides robustness against the time delayed estimation (TDE) error that arises due to approximation of the manipulator dynamics. Thus, the proposed control law tries to establish a desired impedance model between the robot end effector variables i.e. force and motion in presence of uncertainties, both when it is encountering smooth contact forces and during free motion. Simulation results for a two link manipulator using the proposed controller along with convergence analysis are shown to validate the proposition. ",

The unsupervised, joint optimization of neural intrinsics fields can be free from training data bias as well as accumulating error, and fully exploits all observed pixel values for UPS.

However, recent studies in clinical imaging have shown the limited generalization of biomarkers across and beyond benchmark datasets. Despite increasing model complexity and sample size in neuroimaging, the classification performance of ASD remains far away from clinical application. This raises the question of how we can overcome these barriers to develop early biomarkers for ASD. One approach might be to rethink how we operationalize the theoretical basis of this disease in machine learning models. Here we introduced unsupervised graph representations that explicitly map the neural mechanisms of a core aspect of ASD, deficits in dyadic social interaction, as assessed by dual brain recordings, termed hyperscanning, and evaluated their predictive performance. The proposed method differs from existing approaches in that it is more suitable to capture social interaction deficits on a neural level and is applicable to young children and infants. First results from functional-near infrared spectroscopy data indicate potential predictive capacities of a task-agnostic, interpretable graph representation. This first effort to leverage interaction-related deficits on neural level to classify ASD may stimulate new approaches and methods to enhance existing models to achieve developmental ASD biomarkers in the future.

This paper pertains to a novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based solution for sequence prediction under missing data. Our method is distinct from all existing approaches. It tries to encode the missingness patterns in the data directly without trying to impute data either before or during model building. Our encoding is lossless and achieves compression. It can be employed for both sequence classification and forecasting. We focus on forecasting here in a general context of multi-step prediction in presence of possible exogenous inputs. In particular, we propose novel variants of Encoder-Decoder (Seq2Seq) RNNs for this. The encoder here adopts the above mentioned pattern encoding, while at the decoder which has a different structure, multiple variants are feasible. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed architecture via multiple experiments on both single and multiple sequence (real) data-sets. We consider both scenarios where (i)data is naturally missing and (ii)data is synthetically masked. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables independent parties to collaboratively build machine learning (ML) models while protecting data privacy. Vertical federated learning (VFL), a variant of FL, has recently drawn increasing attention as the VFL matches the enterprises' demands of leveraging more valuable features to achieve better model performance without jeopardizing data privacy. However, conventional VFL may run into data deficiency as it is only able to exploit aligned samples (belonging to different parties) with labels, leaving often the majority of unaligned and unlabeled samples unused. The data deficiency hampers the effort of the federation. In this work, we propose a Federated Hybrid Self-Supervised Learning framework, coined FedHSSL, to utilize all available data (including unaligned and unlabeled samples) of participants to train the joint VFL model. The core idea of FedHSSL is to utilize cross-party views (i.e., dispersed features) of samples aligned among parties and local views (i.e., augmentations) of samples within each party to improve the representation learning capability of the joint VFL model through SSL (e.g., SimSiam). FedHSSL further exploits generic features shared among parties to boost the performance of the joint model through partial model aggregation. We empirically demonstrate that our FedHSSL achieves significant performance gains compared with baseline methods, especially when the number of labeled samples is small. We provide an in-depth analysis of FedHSSL regarding privacy leakage, which is rarely discussed in existing self-supervised VFL works. We investigate the protection mechanism for FedHSSL. The results show our protection can thwart the state-of-the-art label inference attack. ",

    "title": "Adaptive Re-Ranking with a Corpus Graph",
    "abstract": "Search systems often employ a re-ranking pipeline, wherein documents (or passages) from an initial pool of candidates are assigned new ranking scores. The process enables the use of highly-effective but expensive scoring functions that are not suitable for use directly in structures like inverted indices or approximate nearest neighbour indices. However, re-ranking pipelines are inherently limited by the recall of the initial candidate pool; documents that are not identified as candidates for re-ranking by the initial retrieval function cannot be identified. We propose a novel approach for overcoming the recall limitation based on the well-established clustering hypothesis. Throughout the re-ranking process, our approach adds documents to the pool that are most similar to the highest-scoring documents up to that point. This feedback process adapts the pool of candidates to those that may also yield high ranking scores, even if they were not present in the initial pool. It can also increase the score of documents that appear deeper in the pool that would have otherwise been skipped due to a limited re-ranking budget. We find that our Graph-based Adaptive Re-ranking (GAR) approach significantly improves the performance of re-ranking pipelines in terms of precision- and recall-oriented measures, is complementary to a variety of existing techniques (e.g., dense retrieval), is robust to its hyperparameters, and contributes minimally to computational and storage costs. For instance, on the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset, GAR can improve the nDCG of a BM25 candidate pool by up to 8% when applying a monoT5 ranker. ",

We construct and analyze a human-sensor system where a quickest detector aims to detect a change in an underlying state by observing human decisions that are influenced by the state. Apart from providing an analytical framework for such human-sensor systems, we also analyze the structure of the quickest detection policy. We show that the quickest detection policy has a single threshold and the optimal cost incurred is lower bounded by that of the classical quickest detector. This indicates that intermediate human decisions strictly hinder detection performance. We also analyze the sensitivity of the quickest detection cost with respect to the quantum decision parameters of the human decision maker, revealing that the performance is robust to inaccurate knowledge of the decision-making process. Numerical results are provided which suggest that observing the decisions of more rational decision makers will improve the quickest detection performance. Finally, we illustrate a numerical implementation of this quickest detector in the context of the Prisoner's Dilemma problem, in which it has been observed that Quantum Decision Theory can uniquely model empirically tested violations of the sure-thing principle.

    "abstract": "Phase retrieval (PR), a long-established challenge for recovering a complex-valued signal from its Fourier intensity-only measurements, has attracted considerable attention due to its widespread applications in digital imaging. Recently, deep learning-based approaches were developed that achieved some success in single-shot PR. These approaches require a single Fourier intensity measurement without the need to impose any additional constraints on the measured data. Nevertheless, vanilla deep neural networks (DNN) do not give good performance due to the substantial disparity between the input and output domains of the PR problems. Physics-informed approaches try to incorporate the Fourier intensity measurements into an iterative approach to increase the reconstruction accuracy. It, however, requires a lengthy computation process, and the accuracy still cannot be guaranteed. Besides, many of these approaches work on simulation data that ignore some common problems such as saturation and quantization errors in practical optical PR systems. In this paper, a novel physics-driven multi-scale DNN structure dubbed PPRNet is proposed. Similar to other deep learning-based PR methods, PPRNet requires only a single Fourier intensity measurement. It is physics-driven that the network is guided to follow the Fourier intensity measurement at different scales to enhance the reconstruction accuracy. PPRNet has a feedforward structure and can be end-to-end trained. Thus, it is much faster and more accurate than the traditional physics-driven PR approaches. Extensive simulations and experiments on a practical optical platform were conducted. The results demonstrate the superiority and practicality of the proposed PPRNet over the traditional learning-based PR methods. ",

    "abstract": "We consider the inverse problem for the Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) such that the parameters of the dependency structure can exhibit random changepoints over time. This can arise, for example, when the physical system is either under malicious attack (e.g., hacker attacks on power grids and internet networks) or subject to extreme external conditions (e.g., weather conditions impacting electricity grids or large market movements impacting valuations of derivative contracts). For that purpose, we employ Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) -- universal approximators that can incorporate prior information from any physical law described by a system of PDEs. This prior knowledge acts in the training of the neural network as a regularization that limits the space of admissible solutions and increases the correctness of the function approximation. We show that when the true data generating process exhibits changepoints in the PDE dynamics, this regularization can lead to a complete miss-calibration and a failure of the model. Therefore, we propose an extension of PINNs using a Total-Variation penalty which accommodates (multiple) changepoints in the PDE dynamics. These changepoints can occur at random locations over time, and they are estimated together with the solutions. We propose an additional refinement algorithm that combines changepoints detection with a reduced dynamic programming method that is feasible for the computationally intensive PINNs methods, and we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed model empirically using examples of different equations with changes in the parameters. In case of no changepoints in the data, the proposed model reduces to the original PINNs model. In the presence of changepoints, it leads to improvements in parameter estimation, better model fitting, and a lower training error compared to the original PINNs model. ",

The method is a compact end-to-end deep learning model which does not require feature engineering and can use low-cost raw photoplethysmography (PPG) as input signal.

In remote monitoring settings, such as in the WESAD dataset, we apply transfer learning to two other ICU datasets, reducing the MAE to 1.52 \\pm 0.50 breaths per minute, showing this model allows accurate and practical estimation of RR on affordable and wearable devices.

If a connected graph has intersection of some edges, then some loops of one-vertex graph will also intersect. Therefore the problem of embedding graphs into some surface is equivalent to the question of embedding one-vertex graph in given surface. This paper considers a graph with rotations called hieroglyph. The equivalence of four conditions is proved: (1) embedding hieroglyph into torus; (2) the absence of forbidden subgraphs in a hieroglyph; (3) some condition for the graph of loops; (4) the existence of a reduction of hieroglyph to one of the list of hieroglyphs.

    "abstract": "A basic premise in graph signal processing (GSP) is that a graph encoding pairwise (anti-)correlations of the targeted signal as edge weights is exploited for graph filtering. However, existing fast graph sampling schemes are designed and tested only for positive graphs describing positive correlations. In this paper, we show that for datasets with strong inherent anti-correlations, a suitable graph contains both positive and negative edge weights. In response, we propose a linear-time signed graph sampling method centered on the concept of balanced signed graphs. Specifically, given an empirical covariance data matrix $\\bar{\\bf{C}}$, we first learn a sparse inverse matrix (graph Laplacian) $\\mathcal{L}$ corresponding to a signed graph $\\mathcal{G}$. We define the eigenvectors of Laplacian $\\mathcal{L}_B$ for a balanced signed graph $\\mathcal{G}_B$ -- approximating $\\mathcal{G}$ via edge weight augmentation -- as graph frequency components. Next, we choose samples to minimize the low-pass filter reconstruction error in two steps. We first align all Gershgorin disc left-ends of Laplacian $\\mathcal{L}_B$ at smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathcal{L}_B)$ via similarity transform $\\mathcal{L}_p = \\S \\mathcal{L}_B \\S^{-1}$, leveraging a recent linear algebra theorem called Gershgorin disc perfect alignment (GDPA).

Classically, EEG-based BCI algorithms have relied on models such as support vector machines and linear discriminant analysis or multiclass common spatial patterns. During the last decade, however, more sophisticated machine learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks and gated recurrent unit networks, have been extensively used to enhance discriminability in multiclass BCI tasks. Additionally, preprocessing and denoising of EEG signals has always been key in the successful decoding of brain activity, and the determination of an optimal and standardized EEG preprocessing activity is an active area of research. In this paper, we present a deep neural network architecture specifically engineered to a) provide state-of-the-art performance in multiclass motor imagery classification and b) remain robust to preprocessing to enable real-time processing of raw data as it streams from EEG and BCI equipment. It is based on the intertwined use of time-distributed fully connected (tdFC) and space-distributed 1D temporal convolutional layers (sdConv) and explicitly addresses the possibility that interaction of spatial and temporal features of the EEG signal occurs at all levels of complexity. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our architecture provides superior performance compared baselines based on a combination of 3D convolutions and recurrent neural networks in a six-class motor imagery network, with a subjectwise accuracy that reaches 99%. Importantly, these results remain unchanged when minimal or extensive preprocessing is applied, possibly paving the way for a more transversal and real-time use of deep learning architectures in EEG classification.

    "title": "Frequency propagation: Multi-mechanism learning in nonlinear physical  networks",
    "abstract": "We introduce frequency propagation, a learning algorithm for nonlinear physical networks. In a resistive electrical circuit with variable resistors, an activation current is applied at a set of input nodes at one frequency, and an error current is applied at a set of output nodes at another frequency. The voltage response of the circuit to these boundary currents is the superposition of an `activation signal' and an `error signal' whose coefficients can be read in different frequencies of the frequency domain. Each conductance is updated proportionally to the product of the two coefficients. The learning rule is local and proved to perform gradient descent on a loss function. We argue that frequency propagation is an instance of a multi-mechanism learning strategy for physical networks, be it resistive, elastic, or flow networks. Multi-mechanism learning strategies incorporate at least two physical quantities, potentially governed by independent physical mechanisms, to act as activation and error signals in the training process. Locally available information about these two signals is then used to update the trainable parameters to perform gradient descent. We demonstrate how earlier work implementing learning via chemical signaling in flow networks also falls under the rubric of multi-mechanism learning. ",

    "abstract": "A graph $G$ is well-covered if every minimal vertex cover of $G$ is minimum, and a graph $G$ is well-dominated if every minimal dominating set of $G$ is minimum. Studies on well-covered graphs were initiated in [Plummer, JCT 1970], and well-dominated graphs were first introduced in [Finbow, Hartnell and Nowakow, AC 1988]. Well-dominated graphs are well-covered, and both classes have been widely studied in the literature. The recognition of well-covered graphs was proved coNP-complete by [Chv\\'atal and Slater, AODM 1993] and by [Sankaranarayana and Stewart, Networks 1992], but the complexity of recognizing well-dominated graphs has been left open since their introduction. We close this complexity gap by proving that recognizing well-dominated graphs is coNP-complete. This solves a well-known open question (c.f. [Levit and Tankus, DM 2017] and [G\\\"{o}z\\\"{u}pek, Hujdurovic and Milani\\v{c}, DMTCS 2017]), which was first asked in [Caro, Seb\\H{o} and Tarsi, JAlg 1996]. Surprisingly, our proof is quite simple, although it was a long-standing open problem. Finally, we show that recognizing well-totally-dominated graphs is coNP-complete, answering a question of [Bahad\\ir, Ekim, and G\\\"oz\\\"upek, AMC 2021]. ",

    "abstract": "A major challenge for causal inference from time-series data is the trade-off between computational feasibility and accuracy. Motivated by process motifs for lagged covariance in an autoregressive model with slow mean-reversion, we propose to infer networks of causal relations via pairwise edge measure (PEMs) that one can easily compute from lagged correlation matrices. Motivated by contributions of process motifs to covariance and lagged variance, we formulate two PEMs that correct for confounding factors and for reverse causation. To demonstrate the performance of our PEMs, we consider network interference from simulations of linear stochastic processes, and we show that our proposed PEMs can infer networks accurately and efficiently. Specifically, for slightly autocorrelated time-series data, our approach achieves accuracies higher than or similar to Granger causality, transfer entropy, and convergent crossmapping -- but with much shorter computation time than possible with any of these methods. Our fast and accurate PEMs are easy-to-implement methods for network inference with a clear theoretical underpinning. They provide promising alternatives to current paradigms for the inference of linear models from time-series data, including Granger causality, vector-autoregression, and sparse inverse covariance estimation.

Early prediction of heart disease is crucial for reducing heart morbidity and mortality. This paper proposes two quantum machine learning methods i.e. hybrid quantum neural network and hybrid random forest quantum neural network for early detection of heart disease. The methods are applied on the Cleveland and Statlog datasets. The results show that hybrid quantum neural network and hybrid random forest quantum neural network are suitable for high dimensional and low dimensional problems respectively. The hybrid quantum neural network is sensitive to outlier data while hybrid random forest is robust on outlier data. A comparison between different machine learning methods shows that the proposed quantum methods are more appropriate for early heart disease prediction where 96.43% and 97.78% area under curve are obtained for Cleveland and Statlog dataset respectively.

    "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment(MCI) is a precursor of Alzheimer's disease(AD), and the detection of MCI is of great clinical significance. Analyzing the structural brain networks of patients is vital for the recognition of MCI. However, the current studies on structural brain networks are totally dependent on specific toolboxes, which is time-consuming and subjective. Few tools can obtain the structural brain networks from brain diffusion tensor images. In this work, an adversarial learning-based structural brain-network generative model(SBGM) is proposed to directly learn the structural connections from brain diffusion tensor images. By analyzing the differences in structural brain networks across subjects, we found that the structural brain networks of subjects showed a consistent trend from elderly normal controls(NC) to early mild cognitive impairment(EMCI) to late mild cognitive impairment(LMCI): structural connectivity progressed in a progressively weaker direction as the condition worsened. In addition, our proposed model tri-classifies EMCI, LMCI, and NC subjects, achieving a classification accuracy of 83.33\\% on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative(ADNI) database. ",

Traditional machine learning techniques as well as modern day deep learning methods have been applied with promising results. In this paper we present EEG-BBNet, a hybrid network which integrates convolutional neural networks (CNN) with graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN). The benefit of the CNN in automatic feature extraction and the capability of GCNN in learning connectivity between EEG electrodes through graph representation are jointly exploited. We examine various connectivity measures, namely the Euclidean distance, Pearson's correlation coefficient, phase-locked value, phase-lag index, and Rho index. The performance of the proposed method is assessed on a benchmark dataset consisting of various brain-computer interface (BCI) tasks and compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. We found that our models outperform all baselines in the event-related potential (ERP) task with an average correct recognition rates up to 99.26% using intra-session data. EEG-BBNet with Pearson's correlation and RHO index provide the best classification results. In addition, our model demonstrates greater adaptability using inter-session and inter-task data. We also investigate the practicality of our proposed model with smaller number of electrodes. Electrode placements over the frontal lobe region appears to be most appropriate with minimal lost in performance. ",

Such results can be obtained after carefully setting the Predicted Probability of Going to Elevator (PPGE) threshold, thus avoiding a majority of false predictions for people heading to the elevator, while achieving as high as 80% of true predictive elevator landings as early as after having seen only 60% of the whole trajectory of a passenger.
