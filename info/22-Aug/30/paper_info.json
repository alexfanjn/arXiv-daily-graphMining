    "title": "What Does the Gradient Tell When Attacking the Graph Structure",
    "abstract": "Recent studies have proven that graph neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Attackers can rely solely on the training labels to disrupt the performance of the agnostic victim model by edge perturbations. Researchers observe that the saliency-based attackers tend to add edges rather than delete them, which is previously explained by the fact that adding edges pollutes the nodes' features by aggregation while removing edges only leads to some loss of information. In this paper, we further prove that the attackers perturb graphs by adding inter-class edges, which also manifests as a reduction in the homophily of the perturbed graph. From this point of view, saliency-based attackers still have room for improvement in capability and imperceptibility. The message passing of the GNN-based surrogate model leads to the oversmoothing of nodes connected by inter-class edges, preventing attackers from obtaining the distinctiveness of node features. To solve this issue, we introduce a multi-hop aggregated message passing to preserve attribute differences between nodes. In addition, we propose a regularization term to restrict the homophily variance to enhance the attack imperceptibility. Experiments verify that our proposed surrogate model improves the attacker's versatility and the regularization term helps to limit the homophily of the perturbed graph. ",

    "abstract": "Living-off-the-Land is an evasion technique used by attackers where native binaries are abused to achieve malicious intent. Since these binaries are often legitimate system files, detecting such abuse is difficult and often missed by modern anti-virus software. This paper proposes a novel abuse detection algorithm using raw command strings. First, natural language processing techniques such as regular expressions and one-hot encoding are utilized for encoding the command strings as numerical token vectors. Next, supervised learning techniques are employed to learn the malicious patterns in the token vectors and ultimately predict the command's label. Finally, the model is evaluated using statistics from the training phase and in a virtual environment to compare its effectiveness at detecting new commands to existing anti-virus products such as Windows Defender.

    "abstract": "We present the results of the NLP Community Metasurvey. Run from May to June 2022, the survey elicited opinions on controversial issues, including industry influence in the field, concerns about AGI, and ethics. Our results put concrete numbers to several controversies: For example, respondents are split almost exactly in half on questions about the importance of artificial general intelligence, whether language models understand language, and the necessity of linguistic structure and inductive bias for solving NLP problems. In addition, the survey posed meta-questions, asking respondents to predict the distribution of survey responses. This allows us not only to gain insight on the spectrum of beliefs held by NLP researchers, but also to uncover false sociological beliefs where the community's predictions don't match reality. We find such mismatches on a wide range of issues. Among other results, the community greatly overestimates its own belief in the usefulness of benchmarks and the potential for scaling to solve real-world problems, while underestimating its own belief in the importance of linguistic structure, inductive bias, and interdisciplinary science.

In this paper, we explore adversarial training on penultimate activations, ie, input features of the final linear classification layer. We show that this strategy is more efficient and better correlated with the objective of boosting prediction confidence than adversarial training on input images or intermediate features, as used in previous works. Furthermore, with activation normalization commonly used in domain adaptation to reduce domain gap, we derive two variants and systematically analyze the effects of normalization on our adversarial training. This is illustrated both in theory and through empirical analysis on real adaptation tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted on popular UDA benchmarks under both standard setting and source-data free setting. The results validate that our method achieves the best scores against previous arts. ",

Unfortunately, computing the Shapley value is computationally intractable in general. This paper focuses on computing the Shapley value of (weighted) connectivity games. For these connectivity games, that are defined on an underlying (weighted) graph, computing the Shapley value is #P-hard, and thus (likely) intractable even for graphs with a moderate number of vertices. We present an algorithm that can efficiently compute the Shapley value if the underlying graph has bounded treewidth. Next, we apply our algorithm to several real-world (covert) networks. We show that our algorithm can compute exact Shapley values for these networks quickly, whereas in prior work these values could only be approximated using a heuristic method. Finally, it is shown that our algorithm can also compute the Shapley value time efficiently for several larger (artificial) benchmark graphs from the PACE 2018 challenge. ",

One of the most popular problems in social network analysis is finding communities in its network structure. Usually, a community in a social network is a functional sub-partition of the graph. However, as the definition of community is somewhat imprecise, many algorithms have been proposed to solve this task, each of them focusing on different social characteristics of the actors and the communities. In this work we propose to use novel combinations of affinity functions, which are designed to capture different social mechanics in the network interactions. We use them to extend already existing community detection algorithms in order to combine the capacity of the affinity functions to model different social interactions than those exploited by the original algorithms.

We highlight some difficulties that a numerical DDE solver has to address, and explain how DelayDiffEq deals with these problems. We show how DelayDiffEq is able to solve difficult equations, how its stiff DDE solvers give efficiency on problems with time-scale separation, and how the design allows for generality and flexibility in usage such as being repurposed for generating solvers for stochastic delay differential equations.

    "abstract": "Inferring the position of objects and their rigid transformations is still an open problem in visual scene understanding. Here we propose a neuromorphic solution that utilizes an efficient factorization network which is based on three key concepts: (1) a computational framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSA) with complex-valued vectors; (2) the design of Hierarchical Resonator Networks (HRN) to deal with the non-commutative nature of translation and rotation in visual scenes, when both are used in combination; (3) the design of a multi-compartment spiking phasor neuron model for implementing complex-valued vector binding on neuromorphic hardware. The VSA framework uses vector binding operations to produce generative image models in which binding acts as the equivariant operation for geometric transformations. A scene can therefore be described as a sum of vector products, which in turn can be efficiently factorized by a resonator network to infer objects and their poses. The HRN enables the definition of a partitioned architecture in which vector binding is equivariant for horizontal and vertical translation within one partition, and for rotation and scaling within the other partition. The spiking neuron model allows to map the resonator network onto efficient and low-power neuromorphic hardware. In this work, we demonstrate our approach using synthetic scenes composed of simple 2D shapes undergoing rigid geometric transformations and color changes. A companion paper demonstrates this approach in real-world application scenarios for machine vision and robotics. ",

    "abstract": "Stealthy hardware Trojans (HTs) inserted during the fabrication of integrated circuits can bypass the security of critical infrastructures. Although researchers have proposed many techniques to detect HTs, several limitations exist, including: (i) a low success rate, (ii) high algorithmic complexity, and (iii) a large number of test patterns. Furthermore, the most pertinent drawback of prior detection techniques stems from an incorrect evaluation methodology, i.e., they assume that an adversary inserts HTs randomly. Such inappropriate adversarial assumptions enable detection techniques to claim high HT detection accuracy, leading to a \"false sense of security.\" Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, despite more than a decade of research on detecting HTs inserted during fabrication, there have been no concerted efforts to perform a systematic evaluation of HT detection techniques. In this paper, we play the role of a realistic adversary and question the efficacy of HT detection techniques by developing an automated, scalable, and practical attack framework, ATTRITION, using reinforcement learning (RL). ATTRITION evades eight detection techniques across two HT detection categories, showcasing its agnostic behavior. ATTRITION achieves average attack success rates of $47\\times$ and $211\\times$ compared to randomly inserted HTs against state-of-the-art HT detection techniques. We demonstrate ATTRITION's ability to evade detection techniques by evaluating designs ranging from the widely-used academic suites to larger designs such as the open-source MIPS and mor1kx processors to AES and a GPS module. Additionally, we showcase the impact of ATTRITION-generated HTs through two case studies (privilege escalation and kill switch) on the mor1kx processor. We envision that our work, along with our released HT benchmarks and models, fosters the development of better HT detection techniques. ",

While impressive strides have been made in depth estimation, significant challenges remain: (1) ground truth depth labels are difficult and expensive to collect at scale, (2) camera information is typically assumed to be known, but is often unreliable and (3) restrictive camera assumptions are common, even though a great variety of camera types and lenses are used in practice.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has been widely applied in neuroimaging, including to predicting brain-phenotype relationships from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes. MRI data usually requires extensive preprocessing before it is ready for modeling, even via deep learning, in part due to its high dimensionality and heterogeneity. A growing array of MRI preprocessing pipelines have been developed each with its own strengths and limitations. Recent studies have shown that pipeline-related variation may lead to different scientific findings, even when using the identical data. Meanwhile, the machine learning community has emphasized the importance of shifting from model-centric to data-centric approaches given that data quality plays an essential role in deep learning applications. Motivated by this idea, we first evaluate how preprocessing pipeline selection can impact the downstream performance of a supervised learning model. We next propose two pipeline-invariant representation learning methodologies, MPSL and PXL, to improve consistency in classification performance and to capture similar neural network representations between pipeline pairs. Using 2000 human subjects from the UK Biobank dataset, we demonstrate that both models present unique advantages, in particular that MPSL can be used to improve out-of-sample generalization to new pipelines, while PXL can be used to improve predictive performance consistency and representational similarity within a closed pipeline set. These results suggest that our proposed models can be applied to overcome pipeline-related biases and to improve reproducibility in neuroimaging prediction tasks. ",

    "abstract": "As an important supporting facility for electric vehicles, the reasonable planning and layout of charging stations are of great significance to the development of electric vehicles. However, the planning and layout of charging stations is affected by various complex factors such as policy economy, charging demand, user charging comfort, and road traffic conditions. How to weigh various factors to construct a reasonable model of charging station location and capacity has become a major difficulty in the field of electric vehicle charging facility planning. Firstly, this paper constructs the location and capacity optimization model of the charging station with the goal of maximizing the revenue of operators and minimizing the user's charging additional cost. At the same time, the road time-consuming index is introduced to quantify the impact of road congestion on the user's charging additional cost, so as to effectively improve the user's satisfaction during charging. Then, aiming at the charging station planning model, a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with an elite strategy (NSGA-II) based on chaos initialization and arithmetic crossover operator is proposed. Finally, taking the Haidian District of Beijing as the simulation object, the results show that compared with the situation of urban traffic networks not considered, the model proposed in this paper significantly reduces the cost of lost time of users by 11.4% and the total additional cost of users' charging by 7.6%. It not only ensures the economy of the system, but also effectively improves the charging satisfaction of users, which further verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the model, and can provide a reference for the planning and layout of charging stations in the future.

In particular, pose estimation of space objects is achieved using 3D vision data in an integrated Kalman filter (KF) and an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm in a closed-loop configuration. The initial guess for the internal ICP iteration is provided by the state estimate propagation of the Kalman filer. The Kalman filter is capable of not only estimating the target's states but also its inertial parameters. This allows the motion of the target to be predictable as soon as the filter converges. Consequently, the ICP can maintain pose tracking over a wider range of velocity due to the increased precision of ICP initialization. Furthermore, incorporation of the target's dynamics model in the estimation process allows the estimator continuously provide pose estimation even when the sensor temporally loses its signal namely due to obstruction. The capabilities of the pose estimation methodology is demonstrated by a ground testbed for Automated Rendezvous & Docking. In this experiment, Neptec's Laser Camera System (LCS) is used for real-time scanning of a satellite model attached to a manipulator arm, which is driven by a simulator according to orbital and attitude dynamics. The results showed that robust tracking of the free-floating tumbling satellite can be achieved only if the Kalman filter and ICP are in a closed-loop configuration. ",

To this end, we propose a measure called the label continuity error, which generically quantifies the degree of consistency between a sequence and partition for a set of elements.

    "abstract": "The success of deep learning on video Action Recognition (AR) has motivated researchers to progressively promote related tasks from the coarse level to the fine-grained level. Compared with conventional AR that only predicts an action label for the entire video, Temporal Action Detection (TAD) has been investigated for estimating the start and end time for each action in videos. Taking TAD a step further, Spatiotemporal Action Detection (SAD) has been studied for localizing the action both spatially and temporally in videos. However, who performs the action, is generally ignored in SAD, while identifying the actor could also be important. To this end, we propose a novel task, Actor-identified Spatiotemporal Action Detection (ASAD), to bridge the gap between SAD and actor identification. In ASAD, we not only detect the spatiotemporal boundary for instance-level action but also assign the unique ID to each actor. To approach ASAD, Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) and Action Classification (AC) are two fundamental elements. By using MOT, the spatiotemporal boundary of each actor is obtained and assigned to a unique actor identity. By using AC, the action class is estimated within the corresponding spatiotemporal boundary. Since ASAD is a new task, it poses many new challenges that cannot be addressed by existing methods: i) no dataset is specifically created for ASAD, ii) no evaluation metrics are designed for ASAD, iii) current MOT performance is the bottleneck to obtain satisfactory ASAD results. To address those problems, we contribute to i) annotate a new ASAD dataset, ii) propose ASAD evaluation metrics by considering multi-label actions and actor identification, iii) improve the data association strategies in MOT to boost the MOT performance, which leads to better ASAD results.

In the proposed CIM-SR-DCSK-CC system, the source transmits information bits to both the relay and destination in the first time slot, while the relay not only forwards the source information bits but also sends new information bits to the destination in the second time slot. To be specific, the relay employs an $N$-order Walsh code to carry additional ${{\\log }_{2}}N$ information bits, which are superimposed onto the SR-DCSK signal carrying the decoded source information bits. Subsequently, the superimposed signal carrying both the source and relay information bits is transmitted to the destination. Moreover, the theoretical bit error rate (BER) expressions of the proposed CIM-SR-DCSK-CC system are derived over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Compared with the conventional DCSK-CC system and SR-DCSK-CC system, the proposed CIM-SR-DCSK-CC system can significantly improve the throughput without deteriorating any BER performance. As a consequence, the proposed system is very promising for the applications of the 6G-enabled low-power and high-rate communication. ",

Several recent studies have explored such use-cases. However, these studies lack comprehensive evaluation over various metrics (such as reliability, latency, and energy) with regards to scalability and the Radio Frequency (RF) environment. In this work we evaluate the performance of IEEE 802.15.4 and the four BT 5 2.4GHz PHY options for the recently completed IETF 6TiSCH low-power wireless standard. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to directly compare these PHYs in identical settings. Specifically, we use a recently released 6TiSCH simulator, TSCH-Sim, to compare these PHY options in networks of up to 250 nodes over different RF environments (home, industrial, and outdoor), and highlight from these results how different PHY options might be better suited to particular application use-cases.

    "abstract": "We present the design, implementation and evaluation of a new cloud-based social chatbot called MyMigrationBot, that is deployed to Facebook. The system asks and answers questions related to user's personality traits and person-job competency fit to give feedback, and potentially support migrant populations. The chatbot's response database is based on reputable socio-psychological tools and can be customised. The system's backend is written with Node.js, deployed to AWS and Twilio, and joined with Facebook through Graph and Messenger APIs. To our knowledge this is the first multilingual social chatbot deployed to Facebook and designed to research and support migrant populations with feedback in Europe. It does not have personality like other bots, but it can study and feedback on migrants' personality and on other customised questionnaires e.g., job-competency fit. The aim of a social chatbot in our research project is to help engage migrants with social research using feedback information tailored to them. It can help migrants to get knowledge about their psycho-social resources and therefore to facilitate their integration process into a receiving labour market. We evaluated the chatbot on a group of 53 people, incl. 23 migrants, and we present the results. ",

The previous studies successfully perform steady-state power loss estimation for different applications, but which may be limited for the electric vehicles (EVs) with high dynamics. Based on two EV standard driving cycle profiles, this paper gives a comparative study of power loss estimation models with two different time resolutions, i.e., the output period average and the switching period average. The correspondingly estimated power losses, thermal profiles, and lifetime clearly pointed out that the widely applied power loss model with the output period average is limited for EV applications, in particular for the highly dynamic driving cycle. The difference in the predicted lifetime can be up to 300 times due to the unreasonable choice the loss model, which calls for the industry attention on the differences of the EVs and the importance of loss model selection in lifetime prediction.

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the limitations of current over-parameterized shadow removal models. We present a novel lightweight deep neural network that processes shadow images in the LAB color space. The proposed network termed \"LAB-Net\", is motivated by the following three observations: First, the LAB color space can well separate the luminance information and color properties. Second, sequentially-stacked convolutional layers fail to take full use of features from different receptive fields. Third, non-shadow regions are important prior knowledge to diminish the drastic color difference between shadow and non-shadow regions. Consequently, we design our LAB-Net by involving a two-branch structure: L and AB branches. Thus the shadow-related luminance information can well be processed in the L branch, while the color property is well retained in the AB branch. In addition, each branch is composed of several Basic Blocks, local spatial attention modules (LSA), and convolutional filters. Each Basic Block consists of multiple parallelized dilated convolutions of divergent dilation rates to receive different receptive fields that are operated with distinct network widths to save model parameters and computational costs. Then, an enhanced channel attention module (ECA) is constructed to aggregate features from different receptive fields for better shadow removal. Finally, the LSA modules are further developed to fully use the prior information in non-shadow regions to cleanse the shadow regions. We perform extensive experiments on the both ISTD and SRD datasets. Experimental results show that our LAB-Net well outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Also, our model's parameters and computational costs are reduced by several orders of magnitude. Our code is available at https://github.com/ngrxmu/LAB-Net. ",

LTE-Advanced comes with many features that can support this increasing demand. LTE-Advanced supports Heterogeneous Networks deployment, in which it consists of a mix of macro-cells, remote radio heads, and low power nodes such as Pico-cells, and Femto-cells. Embedding this mix of base-stations in a macro-cellular network allows for achieving significant gains in coverage, throughput and system capacity compared to the use of macro-cells only. These base-stations can operate on the same wireless channel as the macro-cellular network, which will provide higher spatial reuse via cell splitting. Also, it allows network operators to support higher data traffic by offloading it to smaller cells, such as Femto-cells. Hence, it enables network operators to provide their growing number of users with the required Quality of Service that meets with their service demands. In-order for the network operators to make the best out of the heterogeneous LTE-Advanced network, they need to use QoS-based packet scheduling algorithms that can efficiently manage the spectrum resources in the heterogeneous deployment. In this paper, we survey Quality of Service based packet scheduling algorithms that were proposed in the literature for the use of packet scheduling in Heterogeneous LTE-Advanced Networks. We start by explaining the concepts of QoS in LTE, heterogeneous LTE-Advanced networks, and how traffic is classified within a packet scheduling architecture for heterogeneous LTE-Advanced networks. Then, by summarising the proposed QoS-based packet scheduling algorithms in the literature for heterogeneous LTE-Advanced Networks, and for Femtocells LTE-Advanced Networks.

    "abstract": "Many machine learning problems use data in the tabular domains. Adversarial examples can be especially damaging for these applications. Yet, existing works on adversarial robustness mainly focus on machine-learning models in the image and text domains. We argue that due to the differences between tabular data and images or text, existing threat models are inappropriate for tabular domains. These models do not capture that cost can be more important than imperceptibility, nor that the adversary could ascribe different value to the utility obtained from deploying different adversarial examples. We show that due to these differences the attack and defence methods used for images and text cannot be directly applied to the tabular setup. We address these issues by proposing new cost and utility-aware threat models tailored to the adversarial capabilities and constraints of attackers targeting tabular domains. We introduce a framework that enables us to design attack and defence mechanisms which result in models protected against cost or utility-aware adversaries, e.g., adversaries constrained by a certain dollar budget. We show that our approach is effective on three tabular datasets corresponding to applications for which adversarial examples can have economic and social implications. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples that mislead models with imperceptible perturbations. In audio, although adversarial examples have achieved incredible attack success rates on white-box settings and black-box settings, most existing adversarial attacks are constrained by the input length. A More practical scenario is that the adversarial examples must be clipped or self-spliced and input into the black-box model. Therefore, it is necessary to explore how to improve transferability in different input length settings. In this paper, we take the synthetic speech detection task as an example and consider two representative SOTA models. We observe that the gradients of fragments with the same sample value are similar in different models via analyzing the gradients obtained by feeding samples into the model after cropping or self-splicing. Inspired by the above observation, we propose a new adversarial attack method termed sliding attack. Specifically, we make each sampling point aware of gradients at different locations, which can simulate the situation where adversarial examples are input to black-box models with varying input lengths. Therefore, instead of using the current gradient directly in each iteration of the gradient calculation, we go through the following three steps. First, we extract subsegments of different lengths using sliding windows. We then augment the subsegments with data from the adjacent domains. Finally, we feed the sub-segments into different models to obtain aggregate gradients to update adversarial examples. Empirical results demonstrate that our method could significantly improve the transferability of adversarial examples after clipping or self-splicing. Besides, our method could also enhance the transferability between models based on different features. ",

    "abstract": "Face presentation attack detection (PAD) plays an important role in defending face recognition systems against presentation attacks. The success of PAD largely relies on supervised learning that requires a huge number of labeled data, which is especially challenging for videos and often requires expert knowledge. To avoid the costly collection of labeled data, this paper presents a novel method for self-supervised video representation learning via motion prediction. To achieve this, we exploit the temporal consistency based on three RGB frames which are acquired at three different times in the video sequence. The obtained frames are then transformed into grayscale images where each image is specified to three different channels such as R(red), G(green), and B(blue) to form a dynamic grayscale snippet (DGS). Motivated by this, the labels are automatically generated to increase the temporal diversity based on DGS by using the different temporal lengths of the videos, which prove to be very helpful for the downstream task. Benefiting from the self-supervised nature of our method, we report the results that outperform existing methods on four public benchmark datasets, namely Replay-Attack, MSU-MFSD, CASIA-FASD, and OULU-NPU. Explainability analysis has been carried out through LIME and Grad-CAM techniques to visualize the most important features used in the DGS. ",

Manual analysis of huge amount of data on social media platforms is difficult. This has opened new research directions for automatic analysis of usercontributed social media documents. Automatic social media data analysis is difficult due to abundant information shared by users. Many researchers use Twitter data for Social Media Analysis (SMA) as the Twitter data is freely available in the public domain. One of the most this research work. Event Detection from social media data is used for different applications like traffic congestion detection, disaster and emergency management, and live news detection. Nature of the information which is shared on twitter platform is short-text, noisy, and ambiguous. Thus, event detection and extraction of event phrases from user-generated and illformed data becomes challenging. To address these challenges, events are extracted from streaming social media data in the form of keyphrases using different cognitive properties. The motivation behind this research work is to provide substantial improvements in the lexical variation of event phrases while detecting events and sub-events from twitter data. In this research work, the approach towards event detection from social media data is divided into three phases namely: Identifying sub-graphs in Microblog Word Co-occurrence Network (WCN) which provides important information about keyphrases; Identifying multiple events from social media data; and Ranking contextual information of event phrases.

Photonic devices are ideal for the design of high-bandwidth, parallel architectures matching the SNN computational paradigm.

As such, we designed and simulated an optoelectronic spiking neuron circuit on a monolithic silicon photonics (SiPh) process that replicates useful spiking behaviors beyond the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF). Additionally, we explored two learning algorithms with the potential for on-chip learning using Mach-Zehnder Interferometric (MZI) meshes as synaptic interconnects. A variation of Random Backpropagation (RPB) was experimentally demonstrated on-chip and matched the performance of a standard linear regression on a simple classification task. Meanwhile, the Contrastive Hebbian Learning (CHL) rule was applied to a simulated neural network composed of MZI meshes for a random input-output mapping task. The CHL-trained MZI network performed better than random guessing but does not match the performance of the ideal neural network (without the constraints imposed by the MZI meshes). Through these efforts, we demonstrate that co-integrated CMOS and SiPh technologies are well-suited to the design of scalable SNN computing architectures. ",

In this research paper, we propose a new dynamic model of opinion formation in directed networks. In this model, the opinion of each node is updated as the weighted average of its neighbours opinions, where the weights represent social influence. We define a new centrality measure as a social influence metric based on both influence and conformity. We measure this new approach using two opinion formation models: (i) the Degroot model and (ii) our own proposed model. Previously published research studies have not considered conformity, and have only considered the influence of the nodes when computing the social influence. In our definition, nodes with low in-degree and high out-degree that were connected to nodes with high out-degree and low in-degree had higher centrality. As the main contribution of this research, we propose an algorithm for finding a small subset of nodes in a social network that can have a significant impact on the opinions of other nodes. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods. ",

SNs have recently been widely used and, subsequently, have become suitable and popular platforms for product promotion and information diffusion. People in an SN directly influence each other's interests and behavior. One of the most important problems in SNs is to find people who can have the maximum influence on other nodes in the network in a cascade manner if they are chosen as the seed nodes of a network diffusion scenario. Influential diffusers are people who, if they are chosen as the seed set in a publishing issue in the network, that network will have the most people who have learned about that diffused entity. This is a well-known problem in literature known as influence maximization (IM) problem. Although it has been proven that this is an NP-complete problem and does not have a solution in polynomial time, it has been argued that it has the properties of sub modular functions and, therefore, can be solved using a greedy algorithm. Most of the methods proposed to improve this complexity are based on the assumption that the entire graph is visible. However, this assumption does not hold for many real-world graphs. This study is conducted to extend current maximization methods with link prediction techniques to pseudo-visibility graphs. To this end, a graph generation method called the exponential random graph model (ERGM) is used for link prediction. The proposed method is tested using the data from the Snap dataset of Stanford University. According to the experimental tests, the proposed method is efficient on real-world graphs. ",

Anomaly detection is an integral part of improving the availability as it eases the system administrator's burden and reduces the time between an anomaly and its resolution. However, current state-of-the-art (SoA) approaches to anomaly detection are supervised and semi-supervised, so they require a human-labelled dataset with anomalies - this is often impractical to collect in production HPC systems. Unsupervised anomaly detection approaches based on clustering, aimed at alleviating the need for accurate anomaly data, have so far shown poor performance. In this work, we overcome these limitations by proposing RUAD, a novel Recurrent Unsupervised Anomaly Detection model. RUAD achieves better results than the current semi-supervised and unsupervised SoA approaches. This is achieved by considering temporal dependencies in the data and including long-short term memory cells in the model architecture. The proposed approach is assessed on a complete ten-month history of a Tier-0 system (Marconi100 from CINECA with 980 nodes). RUAD achieves an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.763 in semi-supervised training and an AUC of 0.767 in unsupervised training, which improves upon the SoA approach that achieves an AUC of 0.747 in semi-supervised training and an AUC of 0.734 in unsupervised training.

Recently, various works have been presented to tackle the problem of inferring those relationships from the system trajectories via deep neural networks, but most of the studies assume binary or discrete types of interactions for simplicity. In the real world, the interaction kernels often involve continuous interaction strengths, which cannot be accurately approximated by discrete relations. In this work, we propose the relational attentive inference network (RAIN) to infer continuously weighted interaction graphs without any ground-truth interaction strengths. Our model employs a novel pairwise attention (PA) mechanism to refine the trajectory representations and a graph transformer to extract heterogeneous interaction weights for each pair of agents. We show that our RAIN model with the PA mechanism accurately infers continuous interaction strengths for simulated physical systems in an unsupervised manner. Further, RAIN with PA successfully predicts trajectories from motion capture data with an interpretable interaction graph, demonstrating the virtue of modeling unknown dynamics with continuous weights.

To successfully attack fine-tuned models under both settings, we propose to first train an adversarial generator against the source model, which adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and maps a clean input to an adversarial example. Then we search in the low-dimensional latent space produced by the encoder of the adversarial generator. The search is conducted under the guidance of the surrogate gradient obtained from the source model. Experimental results on different domains and different network architectures demonstrate that the proposed attack method can effectively and efficiently attack the fine-tuned models. ",

Simulation results verify that our solutions effectively copes with the congestion and outperforms the data throughput demand than the other previous works. ",

    "title": "Measuring design compliance using neural language models -- an  automotive case study",
    "abstract": "As the modern vehicle becomes more software-defined, it is beginning to take significant effort to avoid serious regression in software design. This is because automotive software architects rely largely upon manual review of code to spot deviations from specified design principles. Such an approach is both inefficient and prone to error. In recent days, neural language models pre-trained on source code are beginning to be used for automating a variety of programming tasks. In this work, we extend the application of such a Programming Language Model (PLM) to automate the assessment of design compliance. Using a PLM, we construct a system that assesses whether a set of query programs comply with Controller-Handler, a design pattern specified to ensure hardware abstraction in automotive control software. The assessment is based upon measuring whether the geometrical arrangement of query program embeddings, extracted from the PLM, aligns with that of a set of known implementations of the pattern. The level of alignment is then transformed into an interpretable measure of compliance. Using a controlled experiment, we demonstrate that our technique determines compliance with a precision of 92%. Also, using expert review to calibrate the automated assessment, we introduce a protocol to determine the nature of the violation, helping eventual refactoring. Results from this work indicate that neural language models can provide valuable assistance to human architects in assessing and fixing violations in automotive software design. ",

    "title": "Structural Adaptivity of Directed Networks",
    "abstract": "Network structure plays a critical role in functionality and performance of network systems. This paper examines structural adaptivity of diffusively coupled, directed multi-agent networks that are subject to diffusion performance. Inspired by the observation that the link redundancy in a network may degrade its diffusion performance, a distributed data-driven neighbor selection framework is proposed to adaptively adjust the network structure for improving the diffusion performance of exogenous influence over the network. Specifically, each agent is allowed to interact with only a specific subset of neighbors while global reachability from exogenous influence to all agents of the network is maintained. Both continuous-time and discrete-time directed networks are examined. For each of the two cases, we first examine the reachability properties encoded in the eigenvectors of perturbed variants of graph Laplacian or SIA matrix associated with directed networks, respectively. Then, an eigenvector-based rule for neighbor selection is proposed to derive a reduced network, on which the diffusion performance is enhanced. Finally, motivated by the necessity of distributed and data-driven implementation of the neighbor selection rule, quantitative connections between eigenvectors of the perturbed graph Laplacian and SIA matrix and relative rate of change in agent state are established, respectively. These connections immediately enable a data-driven inference of the reduced neighbor set for each agent using only locally accessible data. As an immediate extension, we further discuss the distributed data-driven construction of directed spanning trees of directed networks using the proposed neighbor selection framework. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the theoretical results. ",

    "abstract": "Learning heterogeneous graphs consisting of different types of nodes and edges enhances the results of homogeneous graph techniques. An interesting example of such graphs is control-flow graphs representing possible software code execution flows. As such graphs represent more semantic information of code, developing techniques and tools for such graphs can be highly beneficial for detecting vulnerabilities in software for its reliability. However, existing heterogeneous graph techniques are still insufficient in handling complex graphs where the number of different types of nodes and edges is large and variable. This paper concentrates on the Ethereum smart contracts as a sample of software codes represented by heterogeneous contract graphs built upon both control-flow graphs and call graphs containing different types of nodes and links. We propose MANDO, a new heterogeneous graph representation to learn such heterogeneous contract graphs' structures. MANDO extracts customized metapaths, which compose relational connections between different types of nodes and their neighbors. Moreover, it develops a multi-metapath heterogeneous graph attention network to learn multi-level embeddings of different types of nodes and their metapaths in the heterogeneous contract graphs, which can capture the code semantics of smart contracts more accurately and facilitate both fine-grained line-level and coarse-grained contract-level vulnerability detection. Our extensive evaluation of large smart contract datasets shows that MANDO improves the vulnerability detection results of other techniques at the coarse-grained contract level. More importantly, it is the first learning-based approach capable of identifying vulnerabilities at the fine-grained line-level, and significantly improves the traditional code analysis-based vulnerability detection approaches by 11.35% to 70.81% in terms of F1-score.

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art neural network language models (NNLMs) represented by long short term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNNs) and Transformers are becoming highly complex. They are prone to overfitting and poor generalization when given limited training data. To this end, an overarching full Bayesian learning framework encompassing three methods is proposed in this paper to account for the underlying uncertainty in LSTM-RNN and Transformer LMs. The uncertainty over their model parameters, choice of neural activations and hidden output representations are modeled using Bayesian, Gaussian Process and variational LSTM-RNN or Transformer LMs respectively. Efficient inference approaches were used to automatically select the optimal network internal components to be Bayesian learned using neural architecture search. A minimal number of Monte Carlo parameter samples as low as one was also used. These allow the computational costs incurred in Bayesian NNLM training and evaluation to be minimized. Experiments are conducted on two tasks: AMI meeting transcription and Oxford-BBC LipReading Sentences 2 (LRS2) overlapped speech recognition using state-of-the-art LF-MMI trained factored TDNN systems featuring data augmentation, speaker adaptation and audio-visual multi-channel beamforming for overlapped speech. Consistent performance improvements over the baseline LSTM-RNN and Transformer LMs with point estimated model parameters and drop-out regularization were obtained across both tasks in terms of perplexity and word error rate (WER). In particular, on the LRS2 data, statistically significant WER reductions up to 1.3% and 1.2% absolute (12.1% and 11.3% relative) were obtained over the baseline LSTM-RNN and Transformer LMs respectively after model combination between Bayesian NNLMs and their respective baselines.

We configure all layers by using NS-3 model objects and set and modify the values used by objects to investigate the effects of system parameters (access mechanism, UAV trajectory pattern, UAV velocity, number of sensors, and sensor traffic generation rate) on throughput, and average delay. The simulation results show that the RTS/CTS access mechanism provides better performance than the basic data access mechanism and the mobility model which has been prescribed shows higher performance than the random mobility model. Moreover, the results indicate that higher velocity of UAV degrades the system performance in terms of throughput and delay.

While there have been intensive studies through past decades on classical methods such as Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, conjugate gradient, multigrid methods and their more advanced variants, there is still a pressing need to develop faster, more robust and reliable solvers. Based on recent advances in scientific deep learning for operator regression, we propose HINTS, a hybrid, iterative, numerical, and transferable solver for differential equations. HINTS combines standard relaxation methods and the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet). Compared to standard numerical solvers, HINTS is capable of providing faster solutions for a wide class of differential equations, while preserving the accuracy close to machine zero. Through an eigenmode analysis, we find that the individual solvers in HINTS target distinct regions in the spectrum of eigenmodes, resulting in a uniform convergence rate and hence exceptional performance of the hybrid solver overall. Moreover, HINTS applies to equations in multidimensions, and is flexible with regards to computational domain and transferable to different discretizations. ",

    "abstract": "A railway is a complex system comprising multiple infrastructure and rolling stock assets. To operate the system safely, reliably, and efficiently, the condition many components needs to be monitored. To automate this process, data-driven fault detection and diagnostics models can be employed. In practice, however, the performance of data-driven models can be compromised if the training dataset is not representative of all possible future conditions. We propose to approach this problem by learning a feature representation that is, on the one hand, invariant to operating or environmental factors but, on the other hand, sensitive to changes in the asset's health condition. We evaluate how contrastive learning can be employed on supervised and unsupervised fault detection and diagnostics tasks given real condition monitoring datasets within a railway system - one image dataset from infrastructure assets and one time-series dataset from rolling stock assets. First, we evaluate the performance of supervised contrastive feature learning on a railway sleeper defect classification task given a labeled image dataset. Second, we evaluate the performance of unsupervised contrastive feature learning without access to faulty samples on an anomaly detection task given a railway wheel dataset. Here, we test the hypothesis of whether a feature encoder's sensitivity to degradation is also sensitive to novel fault patterns in the data. Our results demonstrate that contrastive feature learning improves the performance on the supervised classification task regarding sleepers compared to a state-of-the-art method. Moreover, on the anomaly detection task concerning the railway wheels, the detection of shelling defects is improved compared to state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "While a streaming voice assistant system has been used in many applications, this system typically focuses on unnatural, one-shot interactions assuming input from a single voice query without hesitation or disfluency. However, a common conversational utterance often involves multiple queries with turn-taking, in addition to disfluencies. These disfluencies include pausing to think, hesitations, word lengthening, filled pauses and repeated phrases. This makes doing speech recognition with conversational speech, including one with multiple queries, a challenging task. To better model the conversational interaction, it is critical to discriminate disfluencies and end of query in order to allow the user to hold the floor for disfluencies while having the system respond as quickly as possible when the user has finished speaking. In this paper, we present a turntaking predictor built on top of the end-to-end (E2E) speech recognizer. Our best system is obtained by jointly optimizing for ASR task and detecting when the user is paused to think or finished speaking. The proposed approach demonstrates over 97% recall rate and 85% precision rate on predicting true turn-taking with only 100 ms latency on a test set designed with 4 types of disfluencies inserted in conversational utterances.

    "abstract": "Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) have brought new opportunities to improve traffic throughput and reduce energy consumption. However, the uncertain lane-change behaviors (LCBs) of surrounding vehicles (SVs) as an uncontrollable factor significantly threaten the driving safety and the consistent movement of a group of platoon CAVs. How to ensure safe, efficient, and fuel economic platoon control poses a key challenge faced by researchers in complex traffic environments. This study proposes a dynamic platoon management and cooperative driving framework for a mixed traffic flow consisting of multiple CAVs and possible human-driven vehicles (HDVs) as the SVs on unsignalized roads. In the proposed framework, the leader CAV of the platoon provides a high-level automatic driving decision to the follower CAVs by developing an optimal trajectory estimation of the HDVs while distributed observers and tracking controllers are properly implemented by the follower CAVs. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of three stages. At the observation stage, the cruising information of all the SVs will be collected by the leader CAV through the Cellular-Vehicle-to-X (C-V2X) infrastructure, while an automatic decision-making driving assistance system (ADMDSS) is constructed to determine the driving states of the platoon. When the HDVs approach the communication range of the platoon, in the prediction stage, the trajectories of the HDVs as the target vehicles will be estimated and the reference trajectory planning for the leader CAV and the cooperative controller design for the follower CAVs will be respectively activated by using C-V2X infrastructure. Simulation cases are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. ",

It hinders cutting-edge detectors from focusing on informative areas to produce accurate 3D object detection results. This paper proposes a novel object detection network by semantical point-voxel feature interaction, dubbed PV-RCNN++. Unlike most of existing methods, PV-RCNN++ explores the semantic information to enhance the quality of object detection. First, a semantic segmentation module is proposed to retain more discriminative foreground keypoints. Such a module will guide our PV-RCNN++ to integrate more object-related point-wise and voxel-wise features in the pivotal areas. Then, to make points and voxels interact efficiently, we utilize voxel query based on Manhattan distance to quickly sample voxel-wise features around keypoints. Such the voxel query will reduce the time complexity from O(N) to O(K), compared to the ball query. Further, to avoid being stuck in learning only local features, an attention-based residual PointNet module is designed to expand the receptive field to adaptively aggregate the neighboring voxel-wise features into keypoints. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset show that PV-RCNN++ achieves 81.60$\\%$, 40.18$\\%$, 68.21$\\%$ 3D mAP on Car, Pedestrian, and Cyclist, achieving comparable or even better performance to the state-of-the-arts.

    "title": "Mining Android API Usage to Generate Unit Test Cases for Pinpointing  Compatibility Issues",
    "abstract": "Despite being one of the largest and most popular projects, the official Android framework has only provided test cases for less than 30% of its APIs. Such a poor test case coverage rate has led to many compatibility issues that can cause apps to crash at runtime on specific Android devices, resulting in poor user experiences for both apps and the Android ecosystem. To mitigate this impact, various approaches have been proposed to automatically detect such compatibility issues. Unfortunately, these approaches have only focused on detecting signature-induced compatibility issues (i.e., a certain API does not exist in certain Android versions), leaving other equally important types of compatibility issues unresolved. In this work, we propose a novel prototype tool, JUnitTestGen, to fill this gap by mining existing Android API usage to generate unit test cases. After locating Android API usage in given real-world Android apps, JUnitTestGen performs inter-procedural backward data-flow analysis to generate a minimal executable code snippet (i.e., test case). Experimental results on thousands of real-world Android apps show that JUnitTestGen is effective in generating valid unit test cases for Android APIs. We show that these generated test cases are indeed helpful for pinpointing compatibility issues, including ones involving semantic code changes. ",

The prior approaches target specific chart types or perform an anonymization model uniformly without considering the importance of data patterns in visualizations. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach that facilitates data custodians to generate multiple private charts while maintaining user-preferred patterns. To this end, we introduce pattern constraints to model users' preferences over data patterns in the dataset and incorporate them into the proposed Bayesian network-based Differential Privacy (DP) model PriVis. A prototype system, DPVisCreator, is developed to assist data custodians in implementing our approach. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated with quantitative evaluation of pattern utility under the different levels of privacy protection, case studies, and semi-structured expert interviews.

The proposed scheme effectively incorporates normalized Weisfeiler-Lehman procedure, random walks on graphs, and persistent homology. We thereby integrate three distinct properties of graphs, which are local topological features, node degrees, and global topological invariants, while preserving stability from graph perturbations. This generalizes many variants of Weisfeiler-Lehman procedures, which are primarily used to embed graphs with discrete node labels. Empirical results suggest that these representations can be efficiently utilized to produce comparable results to state-of-the-art techniques in classifying graphs with discrete node labels, and enhanced performances in classifying those with continuous node features.

To address this defect, state-of-the-art solutions choose to train deep networks on an auxiliary dataset of outliers. Various training criteria for these auxiliary outliers are proposed based on heuristic intuitions. However, we find that these intuitively designed outlier training criteria can hurt in-distribution learning and eventually lead to inferior performance. To this end, we identify three causes of the in-distribution incompatibility: contradictory gradient, false likelihood, and distribution shift. Based on our new understandings, we propose a new out-of-distribution detection method by adapting both the top-design of deep models and the loss function. Our method achieves in-distribution compatibility by pursuing less interference with the probabilistic characteristic of in-distribution features. On several benchmarks, our method not only achieves the state-of-the-art out-of-distribution detection performance but also improves the in-distribution accuracy. ",

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has forced many such endeavours to move to an online setting. While the gender-dependent differences in programming courses have been studied previously, for example revealing that girls may feel safer in same-sex groups, much less is known about gender-specific differences in online programming courses. In order to investigate whether gender-specific differences can be observed in online courses, we conducted an online introductory programming course for Scratch, in which we observed the gender-specific characteristics of participants with respect to how they interact, their enjoyment, the code they produce, and the creativity exposed by their programs. Overall, we observed no significant differences between how girls participated in all-female vs. mixed groups, and girls generally engaged with the course more actively than boys. This suggests that online courses can be a useful means to avoid gender-dependent group dynamics. However, when encouraging creative freedom in programming, girls and boys seem to fall back to socially inherited stereotypical behavior also in an online setting, influencing the choice of programming concepts applied. This may inhibit learning and is a challenge that needs to be addressed independently of whether courses are held online. ",

However, the dynamics of recommended items caused by attribute modifications (e.g. changes in prices) are also of great importance in real systems, especially in the fast-growing e-commerce environment, which may cause the users' demands to emerge, shift and disappear. Recent studies that make efforts on dynamic item representations treat the item attributes as side information but ignore its temporal dependency, or model the item evolution with a sequence of related users but do not consider item attributes. In this paper, we propose Core Attribute Evolution Network (CAEN), which partitions the user sequence according to the attribute value and thus models the item evolution over attribute dynamics with these users. Under this framework, we further devise a hierarchical attention mechanism that applies attribute-aware attention for user aggregation under each attribute, as well as personalized attention for activating similar users in assessing the matching degree between target user and item. Results from the extensive experiments over actual e-commerce datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-art methods and achieves significant improvements on the items with rapid changes over attributes, therefore helping the item recommendation to adapt to the growth of the e-commerce platform.

Lateral Movement intrusions have become more intricate with the increasing complexity and interconnected nature of enterprise networks, and require equally sophisticated detection mechanisms to proactively detect such threats in near real-time at enterprise scale. In this paper, the authors propose a novel, lightweight method for Lateral Movement detection using user behavioral analysis and machine learning. Specifically, this paper introduces a novel methodology for cyber domain-specific feature engineering that identifies Lateral Movement behavior on a per-user basis. Furthermore, the engineered features have also been used to develop two supervised machine learning models for Lateral Movement identification that have demonstrably outperformed models previously seen in literature while maintaining robust performance on datasets with high class imbalance. The models and methodology introduced in this paper have also been designed in collaboration with security operators to be relevant and interpretable in order to maximize impact and minimize time to value as a cyber threat detection toolkit. The underlying goal of the paper is to provide a computationally efficient, domain-specific approach to near real-time Lateral Movement detection that is interpretable and robust to enterprise-scale data volumes and class imbalance.

Likelihoods produced by deep generative models, although extensively studied, have been largely dismissed as being impractical for outlier detection. For one, deep generative model likelihoods are readily biased by low-level input statistics. Second, many recent solutions for correcting these biases are computationally expensive or do not generalize well to complex, natural datasets. Here, we explore outlier detection with a state-of-the-art deep autoregressive model: PixelCNN++. We show that biases in PixelCNN++ likelihoods arise primarily from predictions based on local dependencies. We propose two families of bijective transformations that we term \"shaking\" and \"stirring\", which ameliorate low-level biases and isolate the contribution of long-range dependencies to the PixelCNN++ likelihood. These transformations are computationally inexpensive and readily applied at evaluation time. We evaluate our approaches extensively with five grayscale and six natural image datasets and show that they achieve or exceed state-of-the-art outlier detection performance. In sum, lightweight remedies suffice to achieve robust outlier detection on images with deep generative models. ",

    "abstract": "Most programs compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) today are written in unsafe languages like C and C++. Unfortunately, memory-unsafe C code remains unsafe when compiled to Wasm -- and attackers can exploit buffer overflows and use-after-frees in Wasm almost as easily as they can on native platforms. Memory-Safe WebAssembly (MSWasm) proposes to extend Wasm with language-level memory-safety abstractions to precisely address this problem. In this paper, we build on the original MSWasm position paper to realize this vision. We give a precise and formal semantics of MSWasm, and prove that well-typed MSWasm programs are, by construction, robustly memory safe. To this end, we develop a novel, language-independent memory-safety property based on colored memory locations and pointers. This property also lets us reason about the security guarantees of a formal C-to-MSWasm compiler -- and prove that it always produces memory-safe programs (and preserves the semantics of safe programs). We use these formal results to then guide several implementations: Two compilers of MSWasm to native code, and a C-to-MSWasm compiler (that extends Clang). Our MSWasm compilers support different enforcement mechanisms, allowing developers to make security-performance trade-offs according to their needs. Our evaluation shows that the overhead of enforcing memory safety in software ranges from 22% (enforcing spatial safety alone) to 198% (enforcing full memory safety) on the PolyBenchC suite. More importantly, MSWasm's design makes it easy to swap between enforcement mechanisms; as fast (especially hardware-based) enforcement techniques become available, MSWasm will be able to take advantage of these advances almost for free.

    "abstract": "To improve the security and reliability of wind energy production, short-term forecasting has become of utmost importance. This study focuses on multi-step spatio-temporal wind speed forecasting for the Norwegian continental shelf. A graph neural network (GNN) architecture was used to extract spatial dependencies, with different update functions to learn temporal correlations. These update functions were implemented using different neural network architectures. One such architecture, the Transformer, has become increasingly popular for sequence modelling in recent years. Various alterations of the original architecture have been proposed to better facilitate time-series forecasting, of which this study focused on the Informer, LogSparse Transformer and Autoformer. This is the first time the LogSparse Transformer and Autoformer have been applied to wind forecasting and the first time any of these or the Informer have been formulated in a spatio-temporal setting for wind forecasting. By comparing against spatio-temporal Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models, the study showed that the models using the altered Transformer architectures as update functions in GNNs were able to outperform these. Furthermore, we propose the Fast Fourier Transformer (FFTransformer), which is a novel Transformer architecture based on signal decomposition and consists of two separate streams that analyse trend and periodic components separately. The FFTransformer and Autoformer were found to achieve superior results for the 10-minute and 1-hour ahead forecasts, with the FFTransformer significantly outperforming all other models for the 4-hour ahead forecasts. Finally, by varying the degree of connectivity for the graph representations, the study explicitly demonstrates how all models were able to leverage spatial dependencies to improve local short-term wind speed forecasting.

    "abstract": "Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a sampling best-first method to search for optimal decisions. The success of MCTS depends heavily on how the tree is built and the selection process plays a fundamental role in this. One particular selection mechanism that has proved to be reliable is based on the Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees (UCT). The UCT attempts to balance exploration and exploitation by considering the values stored in the statistical tree of the MCTS. However, some tuning of the MCTS UCT is necessary for this to work well. In this work, we use Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to evolve mathematical expressions with the goal to substitute the UCT formula and use the evolved expressions in MCTS. More specifically, we evolve expressions by means of our proposed Semantic-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm in MCTS approach (SIEA-MCTS). This is inspired by semantics in Genetic Programming (GP), where the use of fitness cases is seen as a requirement to be adopted in GP. Fitness cases are normally used to determine the fitness of individuals and can be used to compute the semantic similarity (or dissimilarity) of individuals. However, fitness cases are not available in MCTS. We extend this notion by using multiple reward values from MCTS that allow us to determine both the fitness of an individual and its semantics. By doing so, we show how SIEA-MCTS is able to successfully evolve mathematical expressions that yield better or competitive results compared to UCT without the need of tuning these evolved expressions. We compare the performance of the proposed SIEA-MCTS against MCTS algorithms, MCTS Rapid Action Value Estimation algorithms, three variants of the *-minimax family of algorithms, a random controller and two more EA approaches. We consistently show how SIEA-MCTS outperforms most of these intelligent controllers in the challenging game of Carcassonne. ",

    "abstract": "Data cleaning, architecture, and loss function design are important factors contributing to high-performance face recognition. Previously, the research community tries to improve the performance of each single aspect but failed to present a unified solution on the joint search of the optimal designs for all three aspects. In this paper, we for the first time identify that these aspects are tightly coupled to each other. Optimizing the design of each aspect actually greatly limits the performance and biases the algorithmic design. Specifically, we find that the optimal model architecture or loss function is closely coupled with the data cleaning. To eliminate the bias of single-aspect research and provide an overall understanding of the face recognition model design, we first carefully design the search space for each aspect, then a comprehensive search method is introduced to jointly search optimal data cleaning, architecture, and loss function design. In our framework, we make the proposed comprehensive search as flexible as possible, by using an innovative reinforcement learning based approach. Extensive experiments on million-level face recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly-designed search space for each aspect and the comprehensive search. We outperform expert algorithms developed for each single research track by large margins. More importantly, we analyze the difference between our searched optimal design and the independent design of the single factors. We point out that strong models tend to optimize with more difficult training datasets and loss functions. Our empirical study can provide guidance in future research towards more robust face recognition systems. ",

    "abstract": "In real-world applications, interactions between two entities can be usually represented by signed graphs, i.e., graphs containing edges with positive weight representing node attraction and edges with negative weight representing node repulsion. A relevant problem for the analysis of a graph is to find a graph clustering, i.e., a partition of its nodes into clusters such that nodes contained in the same cluster are densely connected by positive edges and sparsely connected by negative edges. In this work, we propose and engineer all the details of a memetic algorithm based on a novel multilevel approach for the problem. Experimental results show that our memetic strategy computes significantly better solutions than the current state-of-the-art. ",

    "abstract": "We consider communication in a fully cooperative multi-agent system, where the agents have partial observation of the environment and must act jointly to maximize the overall reward. We have a discrete-time queueing network where agents route packets to queues based only on the partial information of the current queue lengths. The queues have limited buffer capacity, so packet drops happen when they are sent to a full queue. In this work, we implemented a communication channel for the agents to share their information in order to reduce the packet drop rate. For efficient information sharing we use an attention-based communication model, called ATVC, to select informative messages from other agents. The agents then infer the state of queues using a combination of the variational auto-encoder, VAE, and product-of-experts, PoE, model. Ultimately, the agents learn what they need to communicate and with whom, instead of communicating all the time with everyone. We also show empirically that ATVC is able to infer the true state of the queues and leads to a policy which outperforms existing baselines. ",

We discover that the effect of attacks crucially depend on whether the rewards are bounded or unbounded. In bounded reward settings, we show that only reward manipulation or only action manipulation cannot guarantee a successful attack. However, by combining reward and action manipulation, the adversary can manipulate any order-optimal learning algorithm to follow any targeted policy with $\\tilde{\\Theta}(\\sqrt{T})$ total attack cost, which is order-optimal, without any knowledge of the underlying MDP. In contrast, in unbounded reward settings, we show that reward manipulation attacks are sufficient for an adversary to successfully manipulate any order-optimal learning algorithm to follow any targeted policy using $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ amount of contamination. Our results reveal useful insights about what can or cannot be achieved by poisoning attacks, and are set to spur more works on the design of robust RL algorithms. ",

Although many previous studies assume that each instance appears in all views, it is common in real-world applications for instances to be missing from some views, resulting in incomplete multi-view data. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Latent Heterogeneous Graph Network (LHGN) for incomplete multi-view learning, which aims to use multiple incomplete views as fully as possible in a flexible manner. By learning a unified latent representation, a trade-off between consistency and complementarity among different views is implicitly realized. To explore the complex relationship between samples and latent representations, a neighborhood constraint and a view-existence constraint are proposed, for the first time, to construct a heterogeneous graph. Finally, to avoid any inconsistencies between training and test phase, a transductive learning technique is applied based on graph learning for classification tasks. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model over existing state-of-the-art approaches. ",

However, in some practical scenarios, graph data are stored separately in multiple distributed parties, which may not be directly shared due to conflicts of interest. Hence, federated graph neural networks are proposed to address such data silo problems while preserving the privacy of each party (or client). Nevertheless, different graph data distributions among various parties, which is known as the statistical heterogeneity, may degrade the performance of naive federated learning algorithms like FedAvg. In this paper, we propose FedEgo, a federated graph learning framework based on ego-graphs to tackle the challenges above, where each client will train their local models while also contributing to the training of a global model. FedEgo applies GraphSAGE over ego-graphs to make full use of the structure information and utilizes Mixup for privacy concerns. To deal with the statistical heterogeneity, we integrate personalization into learning and propose an adaptive mixing coefficient strategy that enables clients to achieve their optimal personalization. Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of FedEgo. ",

The results show that, while a non-faulty robot achieves the highest trust, an apparently faulty robot that can speak manages to almost completely mitigate the loss of trust that is otherwise seen with faulty behaviour. We theorize that this mitigation is correlated with the increase in perceived intelligence that is also seen when speech is present. ",

    "abstract": "Node-link diagrams are widely used to visualize graphs. Most graph layout algorithms only consider graph topology or node attributes for aesthetic goals (e.g., with fewer edge crossings and node occlusions), resulting in information loss and waste. Existing hybrid approaches that bind the two perspectives mostly build layouts on top of the attribute-based communities to better satisfy exploration goals. However, they usually suffer from high human dependency, input restriction, and loosely-coupled bindings of topology and attributes, thus may have limited substantial improvements to the layout quality. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based graph exploration pipeline to enjoy the best of both graph topology and node attributes. First, we leverage embedding algorithms for attributed graphs to encode the two perspectives into latent space. Then, we present an embedding-driven graph layout algorithm, GEGraph, which can achieve aesthetic layouts with better community preservation to support an easy interpretation of the graph structure. Next, graph explorations are extended based on the generated graph layout and insights extracted from the embedding vectors. Illustrated with examples, we build a layout-preserving aggregation method with Focus+Context interaction and a related nodes searching approach with multiple proximity strategies. Finally, we conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluations, a user study, and two case studies to validate our approach. ",

We conduct a study where we assess the participants' response times, accuracy, and preferences for different combinations of the graph's structural and temporal representations on typical dynamic network exploration tasks, with and without support of common interaction methods. Our results suggest that matrices provide better support for tasks on lower-level entities and basic interactions require longer response times while increasing accuracy.

In this paper, we take the first step to uncover the root cause of such Arch-hints and summarize the principles to identify them. We then apply these principles to emerging Unified Memory (UM) management system and identify three new Arch-hints caused by UM's unique data movement patterns. We then develop a new extraction attack, UMProbe. We also create the first DNN benchmark suite in UM and utilize the benchmark suite to evaluate UMProbe. Our evaluation shows that UMProbe can extract the layer sequence with an accuracy of 95% for almost all victim test models, which thus calls for more attention to the DNN security in UM system. ",

However, thus far these methods have assumed that the unlabeled data does not contain out-of-distribution (OOD) classes, which is unrealistic with larger-scale unlabeled datasets. In this paper, we consider a more practical yet challenging problem, Open-Set Semi-Supervised Object Detection (OSSOD). We first find the existing SSOD method obtains a lower performance gain in open-set conditions, and this is caused by the semantic expansion, where the distracting OOD objects are mispredicted as in-distribution pseudo-labels for the semi-supervised training. To address this problem, we consider online and offline OOD detection modules, which are integrated with SSOD methods. With the extensive studies, we found that leveraging an offline OOD detector based on a self-supervised vision transformer performs favorably against online OOD detectors due to its robustness to the interference of pseudo-labeling. In the experiment, our proposed framework effectively addresses the semantic expansion issue and shows consistent improvements on many OSSOD benchmarks, including large-scale COCO-OpenImages. We also verify the effectiveness of our framework under different OSSOD conditions, including varying numbers of in-distribution classes, different degrees of supervision, and different combinations of unlabeled sets.

To this end, we derive online learning rules for spiking neural networks (SNNs) within a Bayesian continual learning framework. In it, each synaptic weight is represented by parameters that quantify the current epistemic uncertainty resulting from prior knowledge and observed data. The proposed online rules update the distribution parameters in a streaming fashion as data are observed. We instantiate the proposed approach for both real-valued and binary synaptic weights. Experimental results using Intel's Lava platform show the merits of Bayesian over frequentist learning in terms of capacity for adaptation and uncertainty quantification. ",

CF network can be an alternative technology to cellular networks for reducing interference. A challenging task in a CF network is scalability, where although the number of UEs tends to infinity, the computational complexity must remain finite in each AP or UE.

The Dense_Net outperforms the Conv_Net in all the cases. For instance, in the first case it has a %62.87 improvement in terms of loss.

This regularization technique reduces model confidence at the class boundary, where the signal is often noisy or uninformative, thus allowing training to focus on clinically informative data points away from this boundary region. From a theoretical perspective, we also show that our method can be framed as an extension of multi-horizon prediction, a learning heuristic proposed in other early prediction work. TLS empirically matches or outperforms considered competing methods on various early prediction benchmark tasks.

    "title": "Reducing Computational Complexity of Neural Networks in Optical Channel  Equalization: From Concepts to Implementation",
    "abstract": "In this paper, a new methodology is proposed that allows for the low-complexity development of neural network (NN) based equalizers for the mitigation of impairments in high-speed coherent optical transmission systems. In this work, we provide a comprehensive description and comparison of various deep model compression approaches that have been applied to feed-forward and recurrent NN designs. Additionally, we evaluate the influence these strategies have on the performance of each NN equalizer. Quantization, weight clustering, pruning, and other cutting-edge strategies for model compression are taken into consideration. In this work, we propose and evaluate a Bayesian optimization-assisted compression, in which the hyperparameters of the compression are chosen to simultaneously reduce complexity and improve performance. In conclusion, the trade-off between the complexity of each compression approach and its performance is evaluated by utilizing both simulated and experimental data in order to complete the analysis. By utilizing optimal compression approaches, we show that it is possible to design an NN-based equalizer that is simpler to implement and has better performance than the conventional digital back-propagation (DBP) equalizer with only one step per span. This is accomplished by reducing the number of multipliers used in the NN equalizer after applying the weighted clustering and pruning algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an equalizer based on NN can also achieve superior performance while still maintaining the same degree of complexity as the full electronic chromatic dispersion compensation block. We conclude our analysis by highlighting open questions and existing challenges, as well as possible future research directions. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear observer, called the neural observer, for observation tasks of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems and uncertain nonlinear systems by introducing the neural network (NN) into the design of observers. By exploring the method of NN representation to the NN mapping vector, we derive stability analyses (e.g., exponential convergence rate) of LTI and uncertain nonlinear systems that pave the way to solve observation problems using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) only. Remarkably, the neural observer designed for uncertain systems is based on the ideology of the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC), which can measure the uncertainty in real-time. The LMI results are also significant since we reveal that the observability and controllability of system matrices are required for the existence of solutions of LMIs. Finally, we verify the availability of neural observers on three simulation cases, including the X-29A aircraft model, the nonlinear pendulum, and the four-wheel steering vehicle. ",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a speaker diarization model based on target speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD) using transformers. To overcome the original TS-VAD model's drawback of being unable to handle an arbitrary number of speakers, we investigate model architectures that use input tensors with variable-length time and speaker dimensions. Transformer layers are applied to the speaker axis to make the model output insensitive to the order of the speaker profiles provided to the TS-VAD model. Time-wise sequential layers are interspersed between these speaker-wise transformer layers to allow the temporal and cross-speaker correlations of the input speech signal to be captured. We also extend a diarization model based on end-to-end neural diarization with encoder-decoder based attractors (EEND-EDA) by replacing its dot-product-based speaker detection layer with the transformer-based TS-VAD. Experimental results on VoxConverse show that using the transformers for the cross-speaker modeling reduces the diarization error rate (DER) of TS-VAD by 10.9%, achieving a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) DER of 4.74%. Also, our extended EEND-EDA reduces DER by 6.9% on the CALLHOME dataset relative to the original EEND-EDA with a similar model size, achieving a new SOTA DER of 11.18% under a widely used training data setting.

    "abstract": "Automatically measuring lesion/tumor size with RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) diameters and segmentation is important for computer-aided diagnosis. Although it has been studied in recent years, there is still space to improve its accuracy and robustness, such as (1) enhancing features by incorporating rich contextual information while keeping a high spatial resolution and (2) involving new tasks and losses for joint optimization. To reach this goal, this paper proposes a transformer-based network (MeaFormer, Measurement transFormer) for lesion RECIST diameter prediction and segmentation (LRDPS). It is formulated as three correlative and complementary tasks: lesion segmentation, heatmap prediction, and keypoint regression. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to use keypoint regression for RECIST diameter prediction. MeaFormer can enhance high-resolution features by employing transformers to capture their long-range dependencies. Two consistency losses are introduced to explicitly build relationships among these tasks for better optimization. Experiments show that MeaFormer achieves the state-of-the-art performance of LRDPS on the large-scale DeepLesion dataset and produces promising results of two downstream clinic-relevant tasks, i.e., 3D lesion segmentation and RECIST assessment in longitudinal studies.

    "abstract": "With the increasing use of high-precision system analysis programs in nuclear engineering, the number of high-fidelity computational data for accident simulation is exploding. Therefore, an algorithm that can achieve both automatic extraction of low-dimensional features from the data and guarantee the validity of the features is needed to improve the performance and confidence of the accident diagnosis system. This study proposes an autoencoder-based autonomous learning framework, namely Padded Auto-Encoder (PAE), which is able to automatically encode accident monitoring data that has been noise-added and with partially missing data into low-dimensional feature vectors via a Vision Transformer-based encoder, and to decode the feature vectors into noise-free and complete reconstructed monitoring data. Thus, the encoder part of the framework is able to automatically infer valid representations from partially missing and noisy monitoring data that reflect the complete and noise-free original data, and the representation vectors can be used for downstream tasks for accident diagnosis or else. In this paper, LOCA of HPR1000 was used as the study object, and the PAE was trained by an unsupervised method using cases with different break locations and sizes as the dataset. The encoder part of the pre-trained PAE was subsequently used as the feature extractor for the monitoring data, and several basic statistical learning algorithms for predicting the break locations and sizes. The results of the study show that the pre-trained diagnostic model with two stages has a better performance in break location and size diagnostic capability with an improvement of 41.62% and 80.86% in the metrics respectively, compared to the diagnostic model with end-to-end model structure.

Tumour in the brain is fatal as it may be cancerous, so it can feed on healthy cells nearby and keep increasing in size. This may affect the soft tissues, nerve cells, and small blood vessels in the brain. Hence there is a need to detect and classify them during the early stages with utmost precision. There are different sizes and locations of brain tumors which makes it difficult to understand their nature. The process of detection and classification of brain tumors can prove to be an onerous task even with advanced MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) techniques due to the similarities between the healthy cells nearby and the tumor. In this paper, we have used Keras and Tensorflow to implement state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, like EfficientNetB0, ResNet50, Xception, MobileNetV2, and VGG16, using Transfer Learning to detect and classify three types of brain tumors namely - Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary. The dataset we used consisted of 3264 2-D magnetic resonance images and 4 classes. Due to the small size of the dataset, various data augmentation techniques were used to increase the size of the dataset. Our proposed methodology not only consists of data augmentation, but also various image denoising techniques, skull stripping, cropping, and bias correction. In our proposed work EfficientNetB0 architecture performed the best giving an accuracy of 97.61%. The aim of this paper is to differentiate between normal and abnormal pixels and also classify them with better accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "The remarkable successes of neural networks in a huge variety of inverse problems have fueled their adoption in disciplines ranging from medical imaging to seismic analysis over the past decade. However, the high dimensionality of such inverse problems has simultaneously left current theory, which predicts that networks should scale exponentially in the dimension of the problem, unable to explain why the seemingly small networks used in these settings work as well as they do in practice. To reduce this gap between theory and practice, a general method for bounding the complexity required for a neural network to approximate a Lipschitz function on a high-dimensional set with a low-complexity structure is provided herein. The approach is based on the observation that the existence of a linear Johnson-Lindenstrauss embedding $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times D}$ of a given high-dimensional set $\\mathcal{S} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^D$ into a low dimensional cube $[-M,M]^d$ implies that for any Lipschitz function $f : \\mathcal{S}\\to \\mathbb{R}^p$, there exists a Lipschitz function $g : [-M,M]^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^p$ such that $g(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{x}) = f(\\mathbf{x})$ for all $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathcal{S}$. Hence, if one has a neural network which approximates $g : [-M,M]^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^p$, then a layer can be added which implements the JL embedding $\\mathbf{A}$ to obtain a neural network which approximates $f : \\mathcal{S} \\to \\mathbb{R}^p$. By pairing JL embedding results along with results on approximation of Lipschitz functions by neural networks, one then obtains results which bound the complexity required for a neural network to approximate Lipschitz functions on high dimensional sets. The end result is a general theoretical framework which can then be used to better explain the observed empirical successes of smaller networks in a wider variety of inverse problems than current theory allows.

Although numerous deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in many medical image segmentation tasks, accurate segmentation of kidney structures on computed tomography angiography (CTA) images remains challenging, due to the variable sizes of kidney tumors and the ambiguous boundaries between kidney structures and their surroundings. In this paper, we propose a boundary-aware network (BA-Net) to segment kidneys, kidney tumors, arteries, and veins on CTA scans. This model contains a shared encoder, a boundary decoder, and a segmentation decoder. The multi-scale deep supervision strategy is adopted on both decoders, which can alleviate the issues caused by variable tumor sizes. The boundary probability maps produced by the boundary decoder at each scale are used as attention to enhance the segmentation feature maps. We evaluated the BA-Net on the Kidney PArsing (KiPA) Challenge dataset and achieved an average Dice score of 89.65$\\%$ for kidney structure segmentation on CTA scans using 4-fold cross-validation.

In practice, the estimated posteriors' computational faithfulness is, however, rarely guaranteed. For example, Hermans et al. (2021) show that current simulation-based inference algorithms can produce posteriors that are overconfident, hence risking false inferences. In this work, we introduce Balanced Neural Ratio Estimation (BNRE), a variation of the NRE algorithm designed to produce posterior approximations that tend to be more conservative, hence improving their reliability, while sharing the same Bayes optimal solution. We achieve this by enforcing a balancing condition that increases the quantified uncertainty in small simulation budget regimes while still converging to the exact posterior as the budget increases. We provide theoretical arguments showing that BNRE tends to produce posterior surrogates that are more conservative than NRE's. We evaluate BNRE on a wide variety of tasks and show that it produces conservative posterior surrogates on all tested benchmarks and simulation budgets. Finally, we emphasize that BNRE is straightforward to implement over NRE and does not introduce any computational overhead. ",

We consider the case where probability distributions are not known a priori but also need to be estimated from data. These estimated distributions lead to empirical Gateaux derivatives, and we study the relationships between empirical, numerical, and analytical Gateaux derivatives. Starting with a case study of counterfactual mean estimation, we instantiate the exact relationship between finite-differences and the analytical Gateaux derivative. We then derive requirements on the rates of numerical approximation in perturbation and smoothing that preserve the statistical benefits of one-step adjustments, such as rate-double-robustness. We then study more complicated functionals such as dynamic treatment regimes and the linear-programming formulation for policy optimization in infinite-horizon Markov decision processes. The newfound ability to approximate bias adjustments in the presence of arbitrary constraints illustrates the usefulness of constructive approaches for Gateaux derivatives. We also find that the statistical structure of the functional (rate-double robustness) can permit less conservative rates of finite-difference approximation. This property, however, can be specific to particular functionals, e.g. it occurs for the counterfactual mean but not the infinite-horizon MDP policy value. ",
