    "title": "The Importance of the Instantaneous Phase in Detecting Faces with  Convolutional Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have provided new and accurate methods for processing digital images and videos. Yet, training CNNs is extremely demanding in terms of computational resources. Also, for specific applications, the standard use of transfer learning also tends to require far more resources than what may be needed. Furthermore, the final systems tend to operate as black boxes that are difficult to interpret. The current thesis considers the problem of detecting faces from the AOLME video dataset. The AOLME dataset consists of a large video collection of group interactions that are recorded in unconstrained classroom environments. For the thesis, still image frames were extracted at every minute from 18 24-minute videos. Then, each video frame was divided into 9x5 blocks with 50x50 pixels each. For each of the 19440 blocks, the percentage of face pixels was set as ground truth. Face detection was then defined as a regression problem for determining the face pixel percentage for each block. For testing different methods, 12 videos were used for training and validation. The remaining 6 videos were used for testing. The thesis examines the impact of using the instantaneous phase for the AOLME block-based face detection application. For comparison, the thesis compares the use of the Frequency Modulation image based on the instantaneous phase, the use of the instantaneous amplitude, and the original gray scale image. To generate the FM and AM inputs, the thesis uses dominant component analysis that aims to decrease the training overhead while maintaining interpretability. ",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have enabled major advances in image classification through convolution and pooling. In particular, image pooling transforms a connected discrete grid into a reduced grid with the same connectivity and allows reduction functions to take into account all the pixels of an image. However, a pooling satisfying such properties does not exist for graphs. Indeed, some methods are based on a vertex selection step which induces an important loss of information. Other methods learn a fuzzy clustering of vertex sets which induces almost complete reduced graphs. We propose to overcome both problems using a new pooling method, named MIVSPool. This method is based on a selection of vertices called surviving vertices using a Maximal Independent Vertex Set (MIVS) and an assignment of the remaining vertices to the survivors. Consequently, our method does not discard any vertex information nor artificially increase the density of the graph. Experimental results show an increase in accuracy for graph classification on various standard datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Properties of interest for crystals and molecules, such as band gap, elasticity, and solubility, are generally related to each other: they are governed by the same underlying laws of physics. However, when state-of-the-art graph neural networks attempt to predict multiple properties simultaneously (the multi-task learning (MTL) setting), they frequently underperform a suite of single property predictors. This suggests graph networks may not be fully leveraging these underlying similarities. Here we investigate a potential explanation for this phenomenon: the curvature of each property's loss surface significantly varies, leading to inefficient learning. This difference in curvature can be assessed by looking at spectral properties of the Hessians of each property's loss function, which is done in a matrix-free manner via randomized numerical linear algebra. We evaluate our hypothesis on two benchmark datasets (Materials Project (MP) and QM8) and consider how these findings can inform the training of novel multi-task learning models. ",

    "abstract": "Dynamic networks are a complex topic. Not only do they inherit the complexity of static networks (as a particular case) while making obsolete many techniques for these networks; they also happen to be deeply sensitive to specific definitional subtleties, such as strictness (can several consecutive edges be used at the same time instant?), properness (can adjacent edges be present at the same time?) and simpleness (can an edge be present more than once?). These features, it turns out, have a significant impact on the answers to various questions, which is a frequent source of confusion and incomparability among results. In this paper, we explore the impact of these notions, and of their interactions, in a systematic way. Our conclusions show that these aspects really matter. In particular, most of the combinations of the above properties lead to distinct levels of expressivity of a temporal graph in terms of reachability. Then, we advocate the study of an extremely simple model -- happy graphs -- where all these distinctions vanish. Happy graphs suffer from a loss of expressivity; yet, we show that they remain expressive enough to capture (and strengthen) interesting features of general temporal graphs. A number of questions are proposed to motivate the study of these objects further. ",

In spite of revolutionizing the way news used to be delivered to people, this technology has also brought along with itself inevitable demerits. One such drawback is the spread of rumors facilitated by social media platforms which may provoke doubt and fear upon people. Therefore, the need to debunk rumors before their wide spread has become essential all the more. Over the years, many studies have been conducted to develop effective rumor verification systems. One aspect of such studies focuses on rumor stance classification, which concerns the task of utilizing users' viewpoints about a rumorous post to better predict the veracity of a rumor. Relying on users' stances in rumor verification task has gained great importance, for it has shown significant improvements in the model performances. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on rumor stance classification in complex social networks. In particular, we present a thorough description of the approaches and mark the top performances. Moreover, we introduce multiple datasets available for this purpose and highlight their limitations. Finally, some challenges and future directions are discussed to stimulate further relevant research efforts. ",

    "abstract": "Semantic Web or Knowledge Graphs (KG) emerged to one of the most important information source for intelligent systems requiring access to structured knowledge. One of the major challenges is the extraction and processing of unambiguous information from textual data. Following the human perception, overlapping semantic linkages between two named entities become clear due to our common-sense about the context a relationship lives in which is not the case when we look at it from an automatically driven process of a machine. In this work, we are interested in the problem of Relational Resolution within the scope of KGs, i.e, we are investigating the inherent semantic of relationships between entities within a network. We propose a new adaptive AutoEncoder, called V-Coder, to identify relations inherently connecting entities from different domains. Those relations can be considered as being ambiguous and are candidates for disentanglement. Likewise to the Adaptive Learning Theory (ART), our model learns new patterns from the KG by increasing units in a competitive layer without discarding the previous observed patterns whilst learning the quality of each relation separately. The evaluation on real-world datasets of Freebase, Yago and NELL shows that the V-Coder is not only able to recover links from corrupted input data, but also shows that the semantic disclosure of relations in a KG show the tendency to improve link prediction. A semantic evaluation wraps the evaluation up. ",

In this paper, we work on real-world multiplex drug trafficking networks extracted from an investigation report. A statistical approach built on the EM algorithm (DegEM) as well as other methods based on structural similarity are applied to reconstruct the multiplex drug trafficking network given different fractions of observed nodes and links. It is found that DegEM approach achieves the best predictive performance in terms of several accuracy metrics. Meanwhile, structural similarity-based methods perform poorly in reconstructing the drug trafficking networks due to the sparsity of links between nodes in the network. The inferred multiplex networks can be leveraged to (i) inform the decision-making on monitoring covert networks as well as allocating limited resources for collecting additional information to improve the reconstruction accuracy and (ii) develop more effective interdiction strategies.

In this paper, we study COVID-19 data interpretation and visualization using open-data sources for 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts from December 6, 2020 to September 25, 2021. Because cities are embedded in rather complex transportation networks, we construct the spatio-temporal dynamic graph model, in which the graph attention neural network is utilized as a deep learning method to learn the pandemic transition probability among major cities in Massachusetts. Using the spectral graph wavelet transform (SGWT), we process the COVID-19 data on the dynamic graph, which enables us to design effective tools to analyze and detect spatio-temporal patterns in the pandemic spreading. We design a new node classification method, which effectively identifies the anomaly cities based on spectral graph wavelet coefficients. It can assist administrations or public health organizations in monitoring the spread of the pandemic and developing preventive measures. Unlike most work focusing on the evolution of confirmed cases over time, we focus on the spatio-temporal patterns of pandemic evolution among cities. Through the data analysis and visualization, a better understanding of the epidemiological development at the city level is obtained and can be helpful with city-specific surveillance. ",

Accounting to the potential unreliable wireless channels due to the impurities of the propagation environments, such as deep fading, blockages, etc., multiple RISs are deployed in the considered IoT network to mitigate the propagation-induced impairments, to enhance the quality of the wireless links, and to ensure that the required freshness of information is achieved. In this setup, an optimization problem has been formulated to minimize the average sum Age of Information (AoI) by optimizing the transmit power of the IoTDs, the IoTDs clustering policy, and the RISs configurations. The formulated problem ends up to be a mixed-integer non-convex problem. In order to tackle this challenge, the RISs configurations are first obtained by adopting a semi-definite relaxation (SDR) approach. Then, the joint power allocation and user-clustering problem is solved using the concept of bi-level optimization, where the original problem is decomposed into an outer IoTDs clustering problem and an inner power allocation problem. Optimal closed-form expressions are derived for the inner problem and the Hungarian method is invoked to solve the outer problem. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves lowest AoI compared to the other baseline approaches. ",

    "abstract": "Efficiently exploiting multi-modal inputs for accurate RGB-D saliency detection is a topic of high interest. Most existing works leverage cross-modal interactions to fuse the two streams of RGB-D for intermediate features' enhancement. In this process, a practical aspect of the low quality of the available depths has not been fully considered yet. In this work, we aim for RGB-D saliency detection that is robust to the low-quality depths which primarily appear in two forms: inaccuracy due to noise and the misalignment to RGB. To this end, we propose a robust RGB-D fusion method that benefits from (1) layer-wise, and (2) trident spatial, attention mechanisms. On the one hand, layer-wise attention (LWA) learns the trade-off between early and late fusion of RGB and depth features, depending upon the depth accuracy. On the other hand, trident spatial attention (TSA) aggregates the features from a wider spatial context to address the depth misalignment problem. The proposed LWA and TSA mechanisms allow us to efficiently exploit the multi-modal inputs for saliency detection while being robust against low-quality depths. Our experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed fusion method performs consistently better than the state-of-the-art fusion alternatives. ",

Specifically, we take the decision-making delay into the optimization problem. Then, a dynamic neural network (DyNN)-based method is proposed, where the model complexity can be adjusted according to the service requirements. We further build a knowledge base representing the relationship among the service requirements, available computing resources, and the resource allocation performance. By exploiting the knowledge, the width of DyNN can be selected in a timely manner, further improving the performance of orchestration. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the traditional static neural network, and also shows sufficient flexibility in on-demand service provisioning. ",

We use the LIP template model to estimate the robot's center of mass (CoM) position and velocity at the end of the current step, and formulate a discrete controller that determines the next footstep location to achieve a desired walking profile. This controller is equipped on the frontal plane with a Neural-Network-based adaptive term that reduces the model mismatch between the template and physical robot that particularly affects the lateral motion. Then, the foot placement location computed for the LIP model is used to generate task space trajectories (CoM and swing foot trajectories) for the actual robot to realize stable walking. We use a fast, real-time QP-based inverse kinematics algorithm that produces joint references from the task space trajectories, which makes the formulation independent of the knowledge of the robot dynamics. Finally, we implemented and evaluated the proposed approach in simulation and hardware experiments with a Digit robot obtaining stable periodic locomotion for both cases. ",

Specifically, we propose a neural contourlet network consisting of a convolutional neural network and a contourlet transform branch. In the encoder stage, we design a spatial-spectral fusion module to effectively fuse two types of cues. Contrary to the encoder, we employ the inverse contourlet transform with learned low-pass subbands and band-pass directional subbands to compose the depth in the decoder.

Despite the initial success of node injection attacks, we find that the injected nodes by existing methods are easy to be distinguished from the original normal nodes by defense methods and limiting their attack performance in practice. To solve the above issues, we devote to camouflage node injection attack, i.e., camouflaging injected malicious nodes (structure/attributes) as the normal ones that appear legitimate/imperceptible to defense methods. The non-Euclidean nature of graph data and the lack of human prior brings great challenges to the formalization, implementation, and evaluation of camouflage on graphs. In this paper, we first propose and formulate the camouflage of injected nodes from both the fidelity and diversity of the ego networks centered around injected nodes. Then, we design an adversarial CAmouflage framework for Node injection Attack, namely CANA, to improve the camouflage while ensuring the attack performance. Several novel indicators for graph camouflage are further designed for a comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that when equipping existing node injection attack methods with our proposed CANA framework, the attack performance against defense methods as well as node camouflage is significantly improved.

    "abstract": "Link prediction is an important task that has wide applications in various domains. However, the majority of existing link prediction approaches assume the given graph follows homophily assumption, and designs similarity-based heuristics or representation learning approaches to predict links. However, many real-world graphs are heterophilic graphs, where the homophily assumption does not hold, which challenges existing link prediction methods. Generally, in heterophilic graphs, there are many latent factors causing the link formation, and two linked nodes tend to be similar in one or two factors but might be dissimilar in other factors, leading to low overall similarity. Thus, one way is to learn disentangled representation for each node with each vector capturing the latent representation of a node on one factor, which paves a way to model the link formation in heterophilic graphs, resulting in better node representation learning and link prediction performance. However, the work on this is rather limited. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of exploring disentangled representation learning for link prediction on heterophilic graphs. We propose a novel framework DisenLink which can learn disentangled representations by modeling the link formation and perform factor-aware message-passing to facilitate link prediction. Extensive experiments on 13 real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DisenLink for link prediction on both heterophilic and hemophiliac graphs.

    "abstract": "Motivated by the ever-increasing concerns on personal data privacy and the rapidly growing data volume at local clients, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a new machine learning setting. An FL system is comprised of a central parameter server and multiple local clients. It keeps data at local clients and learns a centralized model by sharing the model parameters learned locally. No local data needs to be shared, and privacy can be well protected. Nevertheless, since it is the model instead of the raw data that is shared, the system can be exposed to the poisoning model attacks launched by malicious clients. Furthermore, it is challenging to identify malicious clients since no local client data is available on the server. Besides, membership inference attacks can still be performed by using the uploaded model to estimate the client's local data, leading to privacy disclosure. In this work, we first propose a model update based federated averaging algorithm to defend against Byzantine attacks such as additive noise attacks and sign-flipping attacks. The individual client model initialization method is presented to provide further privacy protections from the membership inference attacks by hiding the individual local machine learning model. When combining these two schemes, privacy and security can be both effectively enhanced. The proposed schemes are proved to converge experimentally under non-IID data distribution when there are no attacks. Under Byzantine attacks, the proposed schemes perform much better than the classical model based FedAvg algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "By integrating certain optimization solvers with deep neural network, deep unfolding network (DUN) has attracted much attention in recent years for image compressed sensing (CS). However, there still exist several issues in existing DUNs: 1) For each iteration, a simple stacked convolutional network is usually adopted, which apparently limits the expressiveness of these models. 2) Once the training is completed, most hyperparameters of existing DUNs are fixed for any input content, which significantly weakens their adaptability. In this paper, by unfolding the Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA), a novel fast hierarchical DUN, dubbed FHDUN, is proposed for image compressed sensing, in which a well-designed hierarchical unfolding architecture is developed to cooperatively explore richer contextual prior information in multi-scale spaces. To further enhance the adaptability, series of hyperparametric generation networks are developed in our framework to dynamically produce the corresponding optimal hyperparameters according to the input content. Furthermore, due to the accelerated policy in FISTA, the newly embedded acceleration module makes the proposed FHDUN save more than 50% of the iterative loops against recent DUNs. Extensive CS experiments manifest that the proposed FHDUN outperforms existing state-of-the-art CS methods, while maintaining fewer iterations. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, increasing efforts have been focused on Weakly Supervised Scene Graph Generation (WSSGG). The mainstream solution for WSSGG typically follows the same pipeline: they first align text entities in the weak image-level supervisions (e.g., unlocalized relation triplets or captions) with image regions, and then train SGG models in a fully-supervised manner with aligned instance-level \"pseudo\" labels. However, we argue that most existing WSSGG works only focus on object-consistency, which means the grounded regions should have the same object category label as text entities. While they neglect another basic requirement for an ideal alignment: interaction-consistency, which means the grounded region pairs should have the same interactions (i.e., visual relations) as text entity pairs. Hence, in this paper, we propose to enhance a simple grounding module with both object-aware and interaction-aware knowledge to acquire more reliable pseudo labels. To better leverage these two types of knowledge, we regard them as two teachers and fuse their generated targets to guide the training process of our grounding module. Specifically, we design two different strategies to adaptively assign weights to different teachers by assessing their reliability on each training sample. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method consistently improves WSSGG performance on various kinds of weak supervision. ",

SAR images have a strong sense of granularity and have different scales of texture features, such as speckle noise, target dominant scatterers and target contours, which are rarely considered in the traditional CNN model. This paper proposed two residual blocks, namely EMC2A blocks with multiscale receptive fields(RFs), based on a multibranch structure and then designed an efficient isotopic architecture deep CNN (DCNN), EMC2A-Net. EMC2A blocks utilize parallel dilated convolution with different dilation rates, which can effectively capture multiscale context features without significantly increasing the computational burden. To further improve the efficiency of multiscale feature fusion, this paper proposed a multiscale feature cross-channel attention module, namely the EMC2A module, adopting a local multiscale feature interaction strategy without dimensionality reduction. This strategy adaptively adjusts the weights of each channel through efficient one-dimensional (1D)-circular convolution and sigmoid function to guide attention at the global channel wise level. The comparative results on the MSTAR dataset show that EMC2A-Net outperforms the existing available models of the same type and has relatively lightweight network structure. The ablation experiment results show that the EMC2A module significantly improves the performance of the model by using only a few parameters and appropriate cross-channel interactions. ",

In recent years, a large number of deep neural network-based methods have been proposed, demonstrating significantly better performance than conventional methods on addressing challenging TSAD problems in a variety of areas. Nevertheless, these deep TSAD methods typically rely on a clean training dataset that is not polluted by anomalies to learn the \"normal profile\" of the underlying dynamics. This requirement is nontrivial since a clean dataset can hardly be provided in practice. Moreover, without the awareness of their robustness, blindly applying deep TSAD methods with potentially contaminated training data can possibly incur significant performance degradation in the detection phase. In this work, to tackle this important challenge, we firstly investigate the robustness of commonly used deep TSAD methods with contaminated training data which provides a guideline for applying these methods when the provided training data are not guaranteed to be anomaly-free. Furthermore, we propose a model-agnostic method which can effectively improve the robustness of learning mainstream deep TSAD models with potentially contaminated data. Experiment results show that our method can consistently prevent or mitigate performance degradation of mainstream deep TSAD models on widely used benchmark datasets. ",

This paper explores the projected gradient descent (PGD) attack and the Adaptive Mask Segmentation Attack (ASMA) on the image segmentation DeepLabV3 model using two types of architectures: MobileNetV3 and ResNet50, It was found that PGD was very consistent in changing the segmentation to be its target while the generalization of ASMA to a multiclass target was not as effective.

Making GNN robust against noises and adversarial attacks is an important problem. The existing defense methods for GNNs are computationally demanding and are not scalable. In this paper, we propose a generic framework for robustifying GNN known as Weighted Laplacian GNN (RWL-GNN). The method combines Weighted Graph Laplacian learning with the GNN implementation. The proposed method benefits from the positive semi-definiteness property of Laplacian matrix, feature smoothness, and latent features via formulating a unified optimization framework, which ensures the adversarial/noisy edges are discarded and connections in the graph are appropriately weighted. For demonstration, the experiments are conducted with Graph convolutional neural network(GCNN) architecture, however, the proposed framework is easily amenable to any existing GNN architecture.

While lots of previous works have focused on `goodness-of-fit' of TPP models by maximizing the likelihood, their predictive performance is unsatisfactory, which means the timestamps generated by models are far apart from true observations. Recently, deep generative models such as denoising diffusion and score matching models have achieved great progress in image generating tasks by demonstrating their capability of generating samples of high quality. However, there are no complete and unified works exploring and studying the potential of generative models in the context of event occurence modeling for TPP.

Besides, in terms of measuring the historical impacts, we revise the attentive models which summarize influence from historical events with an adaptive reweighting term considering events' type relation and time intervals. Extensive experiments have been conducted to illustrate the improved predictive capability of \\textsc{GNTPP} with a line of generative probabilistic decoders, and performance gain from the revised attention. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that adapts generative models in a complete unified framework and studies their effectiveness in the context of TPP.

In this first part, we analyze the HCD with GSP from the vertex domain. We first show that for the unchanged images, their structures are consistent, and then the outputs of the same signal on systems defined on the two graphs are similar. However, once a region has changed, the local structure of the image changes, i.e., the connectivity of the vertex containing this region changes. Then, we can compare the output signals of the same input graph signal passing through filters defined on the two graphs to detect changes. We design different filters from the vertex domain, which can flexibly explore the high-order neighborhood information hidden in original graphs. We also analyze the detrimental effects of changing regions on the change detection results from the viewpoint of signal propagation. Experiments conducted on seven real data sets show the effectiveness of the vertex domain filtering based HCD method. ",

Event data often contain highly sensitive information about the people who carry out activities or the people for whom activities are performed. Therefore, privacy concerns in process mining are receiving increasing attention. To alleviate privacy-related risks, several privacy preservation techniques have been proposed. Differential privacy is one of these techniques which provides strong privacy guarantees. However, the proposed techniques presume that event data are released in only one shot, whereas business processes are continuously executed. Hence, event data are published repeatedly, resulting in additional risks. In this paper, we demonstrate that continuously released event data are not independent, and the correlation among different releases can result in privacy degradation when the same differential privacy mechanism is applied to each release. We quantify such privacy degradation in the form of temporal privacy leakages. We apply continuous event data publishing scenarios to real-life event logs to demonstrate privacy leakages. ",

Most of existing methods overlook the effect of two key characteristics of the user's behaviors: for each item list, (i) contextual dependence refers to that the user's behaviors on any item are not purely determinated by the item itself but also are influenced by the user's previous behaviors (e.g., clicks, purchases) on other items in the same sequence; (ii) multiple time scales means that users are likely to click frequently but purchase periodically. To this end, we develop a new multi-scale user behavior network named Hierarchical rEcurrent Ranking On the Entire Space (HEROES) which incorporates the contextual information to estimate the user multiple behaviors in a multi-scale fashion. Concretely, we introduce a hierarchical framework, where the lower layer models the user's engagement behaviors while the upper layer estimates the user's satisfaction behaviors. The proposed architecture can automatically learn a suitable time scale for each layer to capture the dynamic user's behavioral patterns. Besides the architecture, we also introduce the Hawkes process to form a novel recurrent unit which can not only encode the items' features in the context but also formulate the excitation or discouragement from the user's previous behaviors. We further show that HEROES can be extended to build unbiased ranking systems through combinations with the survival analysis technique. Extensive experiments over three large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model compared with the state-of-the-art methods. ",

Moreover, selecting vehicles with different resource statuses to update data will affect the total amount of data involved in training, which further affects the model accuracy.

While the expert data is believed to be crucial for imitation quality, it was found that a kind of imitation learning approach, adversarial imitation learning (AIL), can have exceptional performance. With as little as only one expert trajectory, AIL can match the expert performance even in a long horizon, on tasks such as locomotion control. There are two mysterious points in this phenomenon. First, why can AIL perform well with only a few expert trajectories? Second, why does AIL maintain good performance despite the length of the planning horizon? In this paper, we theoretically explore these two questions. For a total-variation-distance-based AIL (called TV-AIL), our analysis shows a horizon-free imitation gap $\\mathcal O(\\{\\min\\{1, \\sqrt{|\\mathcal S|/N} \\})$ on a class of instances abstracted from locomotion control tasks. Here $|\\mathcal S|$ is the state space size for a tabular Markov decision process, and $N$ is the number of expert trajectories. We emphasize two important features of our bound. First, this bound is meaningful in both small and large sample regimes. Second, this bound suggests that the imitation gap of TV-AIL is at most 1 regardless of the planning horizon. Therefore, this bound can explain the empirical observation. Technically, we leverage the structure of multi-stage policy optimization in TV-AIL and present a new stage-coupled analysis via dynamic programming ",

Due to the limited computing capability, vehicles usually transmit data to a road side unit (RSU) at the network edge to process data. However, vehicles are usually reluctant to share data with each other due to the privacy issue. For the traditional federated learning (FL), vehicles train the data locally to obtain a local model and then upload the local model to the RSU to update the global model, thus the data privacy can be protected through sharing model parameters instead of data. The traditional FL updates the global model synchronously, i.e., the RSU needs to wait for all vehicles to upload their models for the global model updating. However, vehicles may usually drive out of the coverage of the RSU before they obtain their local models through training, which reduces the accuracy of the global model. It is necessary to propose an asynchronous federated learning (AFL) to solve this problem, where the RSU updates the global model once it receives a local model from a vehicle. However, the amount of data, computing capability and vehicle mobility may affect the accuracy of the global model. In this paper, we jointly consider the amount of data, computing capability and vehicle mobility to design an AFL scheme to improve the accuracy of the global model.

This inherent timing restriction that the LN must satisfy, make it susceptible to attacks that seek to increase the congestion on the Bitcoin blockchain, thus preventing correct protocol execution. We study the susceptibility of the LN to \\emph{mass exit} attacks, in the presence of a small coalition of adversarial nodes. This is a scenario where an adversary forces a large set of honest protocol participants to interact with the blockchain. We focus on two types of attacks: (i) The first is a \\emph{zombie} attack, where a set of $k$ nodes become unresponsive with the goal to lock the funds of many channels for a period of time longer than what the LN protocol dictates. (ii) The second is a \\emph{mass double-spend} attack, where a set of $k$ nodes attempt to steal funds by submitting many closing transactions that settle channels using expired protocol states; this causes many honest nodes to have to quickly respond by submitting invalidating transactions. We show via simulations that, under historically-plausible congestion conditions, with mild statistical assumptions on channel balances, both of the attacks can be performed by a very small coalition. To perform our simulations, we formulate the problem of finding a worst-case coalition of $k$ adversarial nodes as a graph cut problem. Our experimental findings are supported by a theoretical justification based on the scale-free topology of the LN. ",

    "abstract": "Since the severe imbalanced predicate distributions in common subject-object relations, current Scene Graph Generation (SGG) methods tend to predict frequent predicate categories and fail to recognize rare ones. To improve the robustness of SGG models on different predicate categories, recent research has focused on unbiased SGG and adopted mean Recall@K (mR@K) as the main evaluation metric. However, we discovered two overlooked issues about this de facto standard metric mR@K, which makes current unbiased SGG evaluation vulnerable and unfair: 1) mR@K neglects the correlations among predicates and unintentionally breaks category independence when ranking all the triplet predictions together regardless of the predicate categories, leading to the performance of some predicates being underestimated. 2) mR@K neglects the compositional diversity of different predicates and assigns excessively high weights to some oversimple category samples with limited composable relation triplet types. It totally conflicts with the goal of SGG task which encourages models to detect more types of visual relationship triplets. In addition, we investigate the under-explored correlation between objects and predicates, which can serve as a simple but strong baseline for unbiased SGG. In this paper, we refine mR@K and propose two complementary evaluation metrics for unbiased SGG: Independent Mean Recall (IMR) and weighted IMR (wIMR). These two metrics are designed by considering the category independence and diversity of composable relation triplets, respectively. We compare the proposed metrics with the de facto standard metrics through extensive experiments and discuss the solutions to evaluate unbiased SGG in a more trustworthy way. ",

The dynamical systems of multivariate time series could be modelled with complex unknown partial differential equations (PDEs) which play a prominent role in many disciplines of science and engineering. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time model for arbitrary-step prediction to learn an unknown PDE system in multivariate time series whose governing equations are parameterised by self-attention and gated recurrent neural networks.

Importantly, the model can be reduced into a regularised ordinary differential equation (ODE) problem with special designed regularisation guidance, which makes the PDE problem tractable to obtain numerical solutions and feasible to predict multiple future values of the target series at arbitrary time points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model could achieve competitive accuracy over strong baselines: on average, it outperforms the best baseline by reducing $9.85\\%$ on RMSE and $13.98\\%$ on MAE for arbitrary-step prediction.

In this paper, we propose a Negative Region Proposal Network(nRPN) to improve Region Proposal Network(RPN).

    "abstract": "Modeling virtual agents with behavior style is one factor for personalizing human agent interaction. We propose an efficient yet effective machine learning approach to synthesize gestures driven by prosodic features and text in the style of different speakers including those unseen during training. Our model performs zero shot multimodal style transfer driven by multimodal data from the PATS database containing videos of various speakers. We view style as being pervasive while speaking, it colors the communicative behaviors expressivity while speech content is carried by multimodal signals and text. This disentanglement scheme of content and style allows us to directly infer the style embedding even of speaker whose data are not part of the training phase, without requiring any further training or fine tuning. The first goal of our model is to generate the gestures of a source speaker based on the content of two audio and text modalities. The second goal is to condition the source speaker predicted gestures on the multimodal behavior style embedding of a target speaker. The third goal is to allow zero shot style transfer of speakers unseen during training without retraining the model. Our system consists of: (1) a speaker style encoder network that learns to generate a fixed dimensional speaker embedding style from a target speaker multimodal data and (2) a sequence to sequence synthesis network that synthesizes gestures based on the content of the input modalities of a source speaker and conditioned on the speaker style embedding. We evaluate that our model can synthesize gestures of a source speaker and transfer the knowledge of target speaker style variability to the gesture generation task in a zero shot setup. We convert the 2D gestures to 3D poses and produce 3D animations. We conduct objective and subjective evaluations to validate our approach and compare it with a baseline. ",

We propose a novel channel prediction method based on multi-dimensional matrix pencil (MDMP), which estimates the path parameters by exploiting the angular-frequency-domain and angular-time-domain structures of the wideband channel. The MDMP method also entails a novel path pairing scheme to pair the delay and Doppler, based on the super-resolution property of the angle estimation. Our method is able to deal with the realistic constraint of time-varying path delays introduced by user movements, which has not been considered so far in the literature. We prove theoretically that in the scenario with time-varying path delays, the prediction error converges to zero with the increasing number of the base station (BS) antennas, providing that only two arbitrary channel samples are known. We also derive a lower-bound of the number of the BS antennas to achieve a satisfactory performance. Simulation results under the industrial channel model of 3GPP demonstrate that our proposed MDMP method approaches the performance of the stationary scenario even when the users' velocity reaches 120 km/h and the latency of the channel state information is as large as 16 ms.

The existing works are limited to trimmed video-level emotion classification, failing to locate the temporal window corresponding to the emotion. In this paper, we introduce a new task, named Temporal Emotion Localization in videos~(TEL), which aims to detect human emotions and localize their corresponding temporal boundaries in untrimmed videos with aligned subtitles. TEL presents three unique challenges compared to temporal action localization: 1) The emotions have extremely varied temporal dynamics; 2) The emotion cues are embedded in both appearances and complex plots; 3) The fine-grained temporal annotations are complicated and labor-intensive. To address the first two challenges, we propose a novel dilated context integrated network with a coarse-fine two-stream architecture. The coarse stream captures varied temporal dynamics by modeling multi-granularity temporal contexts. The fine stream achieves complex plots understanding by reasoning the dependency between the multi-granularity temporal contexts from the coarse stream and adaptively integrates them into fine-grained video segment features. To address the third challenge, we introduce a cross-modal consensus learning paradigm, which leverages the inherent semantic consensus between the aligned video and subtitle to achieve weakly-supervised learning. We contribute a new testing set with 3,000 manually-annotated temporal boundaries so that future research on the TEL problem can be quantitatively evaluated.

The augmentation is learned in additional training before the classification training and makes use of bi-level optimization, to optimize the augmentation policy and maximize accuracy. We evaluate our approach on two domain-specific datasets, containing satellite images and hand-drawn sketches, and obtain state-of-the-art results. We further investigate in an ablation the different parameters relevant for learning augmentation policies and show how policy learning can be used to adapt augmentations to datasets beyond ImageNet.

    "abstract": "Developers often need to decide which APIs to use for the functions being implemented. With the ever-growing number of APIs and libraries, it becomes increasingly difficult for developers to find appropriate APIs, indicating the necessity of automatic API usage recommendation. Previous studies adopt statistical models or collaborative filtering methods to mine the implicit API usage patterns for recommendation. However, they rely on the occurrence frequencies of APIs for mining usage patterns, thus prone to fail for the low-frequency APIs. Besides, prior studies generally regard the API call interaction graph as homogeneous graph, ignoring the rich information (e.g., edge types) in the structure graph. In this work, we propose a novel method named MEGA for improving the recommendation accuracy especially for the low-frequency APIs. Specifically, besides call interaction graph, MEGA considers another two new heterogeneous graphs: global API co-occurrence graph enriched with the API frequency information and hierarchical structure graph enriched with the project component information. With the three multi-view heterogeneous graphs, MEGA can capture the API usage patterns more accurately. Experiments on three Java benchmark datasets demonstrate that MEGA significantly outperforms the baseline models by at least 19% with respect to the Success Rate@1 metric. Especially, for the low-frequency APIs, MEGA also increases the baselines by at least 55% regarding the Success Rate@1. ",

    "abstract": "Software Log anomaly event detection with masked event prediction has various technical approaches with countless configurations and parameters. Our objective is to provide a baseline of settings for similar studies in the future. The models we use are the N-Gram model, which is a classic approach in the field of natural language processing (NLP), and two deep learning (DL) models long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN). For datasets we used four datasets Profilence, BlueGene/L (BGL), Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Hadoop. Other settings are the size of the sliding window which determines how many surrounding events we are using to predict a given event, mask position (the position within the window we are predicting), the usage of only unique sequences, and the portion of data that is used for training. The results show clear indications of settings that can be generalized across datasets. The performance of the DL models does not deteriorate as the window size increases while the N-Gram model shows worse performance with large window sizes on the BGL and Profilence datasets. Despite the popularity of Next Event Prediction, the results show that in this context it is better not to predict events at the edges of the subsequence, i.e., first or last event, with the best result coming from predicting the fourth event when the window size is five. Regarding the amount of data used for training, the results show differences across datasets and models. For example, the N-Gram model appears to be more sensitive toward the lack of data than the DL models. Overall, for similar experimental setups we suggest the following general baseline: Window size 10, mask position second to last, do not filter out non-unique sequences, and use a half of the total data for training.

    "abstract": "Fine-grained visual classification can be addressed by deep representation learning under supervision of manually pre-defined targets (e.g., one-hot or the Hadamard codes). Such target coding schemes are less flexible to model inter-class correlation and are sensitive to sparse and imbalanced data distribution as well. In light of this, this paper introduces a novel target coding scheme -- dynamic target relation graphs (DTRG), which, as an auxiliary feature regularization, is a self-generated structural output to be mapped from input images. Specifically, online computation of class-level feature centers is designed to generate cross-category distance in the representation space, which can thus be depicted by a dynamic graph in a non-parametric manner. Explicitly minimizing intra-class feature variations anchored on those class-level centers can encourage learning of discriminative features. Moreover, owing to exploiting inter-class dependency, the proposed target graphs can alleviate data sparsity and imbalanceness in representation learning. Inspired by recent success of the mixup style data augmentation, this paper introduces randomness into soft construction of dynamic target relation graphs to further explore relation diversity of target classes. Experimental results can demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a number of diverse benchmarks of multiple visual classification tasks, especially achieving the state-of-the-art performance on popular fine-grained object benchmarks and superior robustness against sparse and imbalanced data.

When a 'draw' decision is made, the agent outputs a program indicating the stroke to be drawn. As a result, it produces a final raster image by drawing the strokes on a canvas, using a minimal number of strokes and dynamically deciding when to stop. We train our agent through reinforcement learning on MNIST and Omniglot datasets for unconditional generation and parsing (reconstruction) tasks. We utilize our parsing agent for exemplar generation and type conditioned concept generation in Omniglot challenge without any further training. We present successful results on all three generation tasks and the parsing task. Crucially, we do not need any stroke-level or vector supervision; we only use raster images for training. ",

    "abstract": "Training deep neural networks consumes increasing computational resource shares in many compute centers. Often, a brute force approach to obtain hyperparameter values is employed. Our goal is (1) to enhance this by enabling second-order optimization methods with fewer hyperparameters for large-scale neural networks and (2) to perform a survey of the performance optimizers for specific tasks to suggest users the best one for their problem. We introduce a novel second-order optimization method that requires the effect of the Hessian on a vector only and avoids the huge cost of explicitly setting up the Hessian for large-scale networks. We compare the proposed second-order method with two state-of-the-art optimizers on five representative neural network problems, including regression and very deep networks from computer vision or variational autoencoders. For the largest setup, we efficiently parallelized the optimizers with Horovod and applied it to a 8 GPU NVIDIA P100 (DGX-1) machine. ",

    "abstract": "Each new concept of operation and equipment generation in aviation becomes more automated, integrated and interconnected. In the case of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), this evolution allows drastically decreasing aircraft weight and operational cost, but these benefits are also realized in highly automated manned aircraft and ground Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems. The downside of these advances is overwhelmingly more complex software and hardware, making it harder to identify potential failure paths. Although there are mandatory certification processes based on broadly accepted standards, such as ARP4754 and its family, ESARR 4 and others, these standards do not allow proof or disproof of safety of disruptive technology changes, such as GBAS Precision Approaches, Autonomous UAS, aircraft self-separation and others. In order to leverage the introduction of such concepts, it is necessary to develop solid knowledge on the foundations of safety in complex systems and use this knowledge to elaborate sound demonstrations of either safety or unsafety of new system designs. These demonstrations at early design stages will help reducing costs both on development of new technology as well as reducing the risk of such technology causing accidents when in use. This paper presents some safety analysis methods which are not in the industry standards but which we identify as having benefits for analyzing safety of advanced technological concepts in aviation.

This and a high topic imbalance make it a very challenging dataset, since often, the same symptom can have several causes and is not always related to a medication intake. We aim to encourage further multi-lingual efforts in the domain of ADR detection and provide preliminary experiments for binary classification using different methods of zero- and few-shot learning based on a multi-lingual model.

    "abstract": "Catastrophic forgetting (CF) occurs when a neural network loses the information previously learned while training on a set of samples from a different distribution, i.e., a new task. Existing approaches have achieved remarkable results in mitigating CF, especially in a scenario called task incremental learning. However, this scenario is not realistic, and limited work has been done to achieve good results on more realistic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization method called Centroids Matching, that, inspired by meta-learning approaches, fights CF by operating in the feature space produced by the neural network, achieving good results while requiring a small memory footprint. Specifically, the approach classifies the samples directly using the feature vectors produced by the neural network, by matching those vectors with the centroids representing the classes from the current task, or all the tasks up to that point. Centroids Matching is faster than competing baselines, and it can be exploited to efficiently mitigate CF, by preserving the distances between the embedding space produced by the model when past tasks were over, and the one currently produced, leading to a method that achieves high accuracy on all the tasks, without using an external memory when operating on easy scenarios, or using a small one for more realistic ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Centroids Matching achieves accuracy gains on multiple datasets and scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, graph neural networks have shown the superiority of modeling the complex topological structures in heterogeneous network-based recommender systems. Due to the diverse interactions among nodes and abundant semantics emerging from diverse types of nodes and edges, there is a bursting research interest in learning expressive node representations in multiplex heterogeneous networks. One of the most important tasks in recommender systems is to predict the potential connection between two nodes under a specific edge type (i.e., relationship). Although existing studies utilize explicit metapaths to aggregate neighbors, practically they only consider intra-relationship metapaths and thus fail to leverage the potential uplift by inter-relationship information. Moreover, it is not always straightforward to exploit inter-relationship metapaths comprehensively under diverse relationships, especially with the increasing number of node and edge types. In addition, contributions of different relationships between two nodes are difficult to measure. To address the challenges, we propose HybridGNN, an end-to-end GNN model with hybrid aggregation flows and hierarchical attentions to fully utilize the heterogeneity in the multiplex scenarios. Specifically, HybridGNN applies a randomized inter-relationship exploration module to exploit the multiplexity property among different relationships. Then, our model leverages hybrid aggregation flows under intra-relationship metapaths and randomized exploration to learn the rich semantics. To explore the importance of different aggregation flow and take advantage of the multiplexity property, we bring forward a novel hierarchical attention module which leverages both metapath-level attention and relationship-level attention. Extensive experimental results suggest that HybridGNN achieves the best performance compared to several state-of-the-art baselines. ",

    "abstract": "Every hour, huge amounts of visual contents are posted on social media and user-generated content platforms. To find relevant videos by means of a natural language query, text-video retrieval methods have received increased attention over the past few years. Data augmentation techniques were introduced to increase the performance on unseen test examples by creating new training samples with the application of semantics-preserving techniques, such as color space or geometric transformations on images. Yet, these techniques are usually applied on raw data, leading to more resource-demanding solutions and also requiring the shareability of the raw data, which may not always be true, e.g. copyright issues with clips from movies or TV series. To address this shortcoming, we propose a multimodal data augmentation technique which works in the feature space and creates new videos and captions by mixing semantically similar samples. We experiment our solution on a large scale public dataset, EPIC-Kitchens-100, and achieve considerable improvements over a baseline method, improved state-of-the-art performance, while at the same time performing multiple ablation studies.

However, in many modern machine learning applications, the required regularity conditions are not satisfied. In particular, this is the case for rectified linear unit (ReLU) networks. In this paper, we prove a variant of the relevant dynamical systems result, a center-stable manifold theorem, in which we relax some of the regularity requirements. Then, we verify that shallow ReLU networks fit into the new framework. Building on a classification of critical points of the square integral loss of shallow ReLU networks measured against an affine target function, we deduce that gradient descent avoids most saddle points. We proceed to prove convergence to global minima if the initialization is sufficiently good, which is expressed by an explicit threshold on the limiting loss. ",

    "abstract": "Cache template attacks demonstrated automated leakage of user input in shared libraries. However, for large binaries, the runtime is prohibitively high. Other automated approaches focused on cryptographic implementations and media software but are not directly applicable to user input. Hence, discovering and eliminating all user input side-channel leakage on a cache-line granularity within huge code bases are impractical. In this paper, we present a new generic cache template attack technique, LBTA, layered binary templating attacks. LBTA uses multiple coarser-grained side channel layers as an extension to cache-line granularity templating to speed up the runtime of cache templating attacks. We describe LBTA with a variable number of layers with concrete side channels of different granularity, ranging from 64 B to 2MB in practice and in theory beyond. In particular the software-level page cache side channel in combination with the hardware-level L3 cache side channel, already reduces the templating runtime by three orders of magnitude. We apply LBTAs to different software projects and thereby discover data deduplication and dead-stripping during compilation and linking as novel security issues. We show that these mechanisms introduce large spatial distances in binaries for data accessed during a keystroke, enabling reliable leakage of keystrokes. Using LBTA on Chromium-based applications, we can build a full unprivileged cache-based keylogger. Our findings show that all user input to Chromium-based apps is affected and we demonstrate this on a selection of popular apps including Signal, Threema, Discord, and password manager apps like passky. As this is not a flaw of individual apps but the framework, we conclude that all apps that use the framework will also be affected, i.e., hundreds of apps. ",

    "abstract": "Multivariate time series anomaly detection has been extensively studied under the semi-supervised setting, where a training dataset with all normal instances is required. However, preparing such a dataset is very laborious since each single data instance should be fully guaranteed to be normal. It is, therefore, desired to explore multivariate time series anomaly detection methods based on the dataset without any label knowledge. In this paper, we propose MTGFlow, an unsupervised anomaly detection approach for Multivariate Time series anomaly detection via dynamic Graph and entity-aware normalizing Flow, leaning only on a widely accepted hypothesis that abnormal instances exhibit sparse densities than the normal. However, the complex interdependencies among entities and the diverse inherent characteristics of each entity pose significant challenges on the density estimation, let alone to detect anomalies based on the estimated possibility distribution. To tackle these problems, we propose to learn the mutual and dynamic relations among entities via a graph structure learning model, which helps to model accurate distribution of multivariate time series. Moreover, taking account of distinct characteristics of the individual entities, an entity-aware normalizing flow is developed to describe each entity into a parameterized normal distribution, thereby producing fine-grained density estimation. Incorporating these two strategies, MTGFlowachieves superior anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the real-world datasets are conducted, demonstrating that MTGFlow outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 5.0% and 1.6% AUROC for SWaT and WADI datasets respectively. Also, through the anomaly scores contributed by individual entities, MTGFlow can provide explanation information for the detection results. ",

    "abstract": "Connectivity-enabled automation of distributed control systems allow for better anticipation of system disturbances and better prediction of the effects of actuator limitations on individual agents when incorporating a model. Automated convoy of heavy-duty trucks in the form of platooning is one such application designed to maintain close gaps between trucks to exploit drafting benefits and improve fuel economy, and has traditionally been handled with classically-designed connected and adaptive cruise control (CACC). This paper is motivated by demonstrated limitations of such a control strategy, in which a classical CACC was unable to efficiently handle real-world road grade and velocity transient disturbances without the assistance of fleet operator intervention, and is non-adaptive to varied hardware and loading conditions of the operating truck. This automation strategy is addressed by forming a cooperative model predictive control (MPC) for eco-platooning that considers interactions with trailing trucks to incentivize platoon harmonization under road disturbances, velocity transients, and engine limitations, and further improves energy economy by reducing unnecessary engine effort. This is accomplished for each truck by sharing load, maximum engine power, transmission ratios, control states, and intended trajectories with its nearest neighbors. The performance of the considerate and cooperative strategy was demonstrated on a real-world driving scenario against a similar non-considerate control strategy, and overall it was found that the considerate strategy significantly improved harmonization between the platooned trucks in a real-time implementable manner.

This is motivated by the nature of image-text paired data that both of the image and the text convey almost the same information but in different formats. The masked signal reconstruction of one modality conditioned on another modality can also implicitly learn cross-modal alignment between language tokens and image patches.

In this research we used an EHR dataset concerning breast cancer metastasis to study overfitting of deep feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) prediction models. We included 11 hyperparameters of the deep FNNs models and took an empirical approach to study how each of these hyperparameters was affecting both the prediction performance and overfitting when given a large range of values. We also studied how some of the interesting pairs of hyperparameters were interacting to influence the model performance and overfitting. The 11 hyperparameters we studied include activate function; weight initializer, number of hidden layers, learning rate, momentum, decay, dropout rate, batch size, epochs, L1, and L2. Our results show that most of the single hyperparameters are either negatively or positively corrected with model prediction performance and overfitting. In particular, we found that overfitting overall tends to negatively correlate with learning rate, decay, batch sides, and L2, but tends to positively correlate with momentum, epochs, and L1. According to our results, learning rate, decay, and batch size may have a more significant impact on both overfitting and prediction performance than most of the other hyperparameters, including L1, L2, and dropout rate, which were designed for minimizing overfitting.

    "abstract": "A new method for multimodal sensor fusion is introduced. The technique relies on a two-stage process. In the first stage, a multimodal generative model is constructed from unlabelled training data. In the second stage, the generative model serves as a reconstruction prior and the search manifold for the sensor fusion tasks. The method also handles cases where observations are accessed only via subsampling i.e. compressed sensing. We demonstrate the effectiveness and excellent performance on a range of multimodal fusion experiments such as multisensory classification, denoising, and recovery from subsampled observations. ",

    "title": "HirFuzz: Detecting High-Level Optimization Bugs in DL Compilers via  Computational Graph Generation",
    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) compilers are widely adopted to optimize advanced DL models for efficient deployment at diverse hardware. However, the optimization of high-level intermediate representation (IR) is found to be error-prone. Testing the implementation of high-level optimization is challenging. First, generating high-level IRs that conform to the integrity constraints required by high-level optimization is non-trivial. Non-conforming IRs are readily rejected by DL compilers before entering the optimization stage, and therefore these IRs are not useful to detect bugs at the stage. Second, it is challenging to expose high-level optimization bugs that does not result in crashes. To address the challenges, we propose HIRFuzz, a fuzzing technique that aims to reveal bugs occurring at the optimization of high-level IR in DL compilers. HIRFuzz generates computational graphs, which are then converted to their underlying high-level IRs for optimization. To reveal high-level optimization bugs, the computational graphs are so generated to explore possible combinations of data types, tensor shapes and operators while conforming to the IR's integrity constraints. In addition, novel test oracles are designed to detect bugs occurring at high-level optimization. HIRFuzz has successfully detected 24 new high-level optimization bugs that occur at TVM, with 19 bugs confirmed and 14 fixed. Furthermore, our experiment results show that HIRFuzz outperforms the state-of-the-art DL compiler fuzzers that can cover high-level optimization stage. Specifically, HIRFuzz found 12 more bugs than the second best fuzzer within the same time budget. ",

Recent deep learning-based methods show promising performance but two challenges remain: (i) how to explicitly model and learn local interactions between drugs and targets for better prediction and interpretation; (ii) how to generalize prediction performance on novel drug-target pairs from different distribution. In this work, we propose DrugBAN, a deep bilinear attention network (BAN) framework with domain adaptation to explicitly learn pair-wise local interactions between drugs and targets, and adapt on out-of-distribution data. DrugBAN works on drug molecular graphs and target protein sequences to perform prediction, with conditional domain adversarial learning to align learned interaction representations across different distributions for better generalization on novel drug-target pairs. Experiments on three benchmark datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings show that DrugBAN achieves the best overall performance against five state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, visualizing the learned bilinear attention map provides interpretable insights from prediction results. ",

    "abstract": "Computing Nash equilibrium policies is a central problem in multi-agent reinforcement learning that has received extensive attention both in theory and in practice. However, provable guarantees have been thus far either limited to fully competitive or cooperative scenarios or impose strong assumptions that are difficult to meet in most practical applications. In this work, we depart from those prior results by investigating infinite-horizon \\emph{adversarial team Markov games}, a natural and well-motivated class of games in which a team of identically-interested players -- in the absence of any explicit coordination or communication -- is competing against an adversarial player. This setting allows for a unifying treatment of zero-sum Markov games and Markov potential games, and serves as a step to model more realistic strategic interactions that feature both competing and cooperative interests. Our main contribution is the first algorithm for computing stationary $\\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibria in adversarial team Markov games with computational complexity that is polynomial in all the natural parameters of the game, as well as $1/\\epsilon$. The proposed algorithm is particularly natural and practical, and it is based on performing independent policy gradient steps for each player in the team, in tandem with best responses from the side of the adversary; in turn, the policy for the adversary is then obtained by solving a carefully constructed linear program. Our analysis leverages non-standard techniques to establish the KKT optimality conditions for a nonlinear program with nonconvex constraints, thereby leading to a natural interpretation of the induced Lagrange multipliers. Along the way, we significantly extend an important characterization of optimal policies in adversarial (normal-form) team games due to Von Stengel and Koller (GEB `97). ",

A holistic study of the growing chemistry literature is, therefore, required that focuses on understanding the recent trends and extrapolating them into possible future trajectories. To this end, several network theory-based studies have been reported that use a directed graph representation of chemical reactions. Here, we perform a study based on representing chemical reactions as hypergraphs where the hyperedges represent chemical reactions and nodes represent the participating molecules. We use a standard reactions dataset to construct a hypernetwork and report its statistics such as degree distributions, average path length, assortativity or degree correlations, PageRank centrality, and graph-based clusters (or communities). We also compute each statistic for an equivalent directed graph representation of reactions to draw parallels and highlight differences between the two. To demonstrate the AI applicability of hypergraph reaction representation, we generate dense hypergraph embeddings and use them in the reaction classification problem. We conclude that the hypernetwork representation is flexible, preserves reaction context, and uncovers hidden insights that are otherwise not apparent in a traditional directed graph representation of chemical reactions.

To improve the diagnostic performance of CXR imaging a growing number of studies have investigated whether supervised deep learning methods can provide additional support. However, supervised methods rely on a large number of labeled radiology images, which is a time-consuming and complex procedure requiring expert clinician input. Due to the relative scarcity of COVID-19 patient data and the costly labeling process, self-supervised learning methods have gained momentum and has been proposed achieving comparable results to fully supervised learning approaches. In this work, we study the effectiveness of self-supervised learning in the context of diagnosing COVID-19 disease from CXR images. We propose a multi-feature Vision Transformer (ViT) guided architecture where we deploy a cross-attention mechanism to learn information from both original CXR images and corresponding enhanced local phase CXR images.

Indeed, we prove that (generically speaking) for any two images one can find some filter for which they produce different persistence diagrams, so that the collection of all possible convolutional persistence diagrams for a given image is an injective invariant. This is proven by showing convolutional persistence to be a special case of another topological invariant, the Persistent Homology Transform. Other advantages of convolutional persistence are improved stability and robustness to noise, greater flexibility for data-dependent vectorizations, and reduced computational complexity for convolutions with large stride vectors. Additionally, we have a suite of experiments showing that convolutions greatly improve the predictive power of persistence on a host of classification tasks, even if one uses random filters and vectorizes the resulting diagrams by recording only their total persistences.

However, existing CNN based pulmonary nodule detection methods lack the ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is vital for global information extraction. In computer vision tasks, non-local operations have been widely utilized, but the computational cost could be very high for 3D computed tomography (CT) images. To address this issue, we propose a long short slice-aware network (LSSANet) for the detection of pulmonary nodules. In particular, we develop a new non-local mechanism termed long short slice grouping (LSSG), which splits the compact non-local embeddings into a short-distance slice grouped one and a long-distance slice grouped counterpart. This not only reduces the computational burden, but also keeps long-range dependencies among any elements across slices and in the whole feature map. The proposed LSSG is easy-to-use and can be plugged into many pulmonary nodule detection networks. To verify the performance of LSSANet, we compare with several recently proposed and competitive detection approaches based on 2D/3D CNN. Promising evaluation results on the large-scale PN9 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code is at https://github.com/Ruixxxx/LSSANet. ",

    "title": "A Study of Modeling Rising Intonation in Cantonese Neural Speech  Synthesis",
    "abstract": "In human speech, the attitude of a speaker cannot be fully expressed only by the textual content. It has to come along with the intonation. Declarative questions are commonly used in daily Cantonese conversations, and they are usually uttered with rising intonation. Vanilla neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems are not capable of synthesizing rising intonation for these sentences due to the loss of semantic information. Though it has become more common to complement the systems with extra language models, their performance in modeling rising intonation is not well studied. In this paper, we propose to complement the Cantonese TTS model with a BERT-based statement/question classifier. We design different training strategies and compare their performance. We conduct our experiments on a Cantonese corpus named CanTTS. Empirical results show that the separate training approach obtains the best generalization performance and feasibility. ",
