    "abstract": "The Extended Discrete Element Method (XDEM) is an innovative numerical simulation technique that extends the dynamics of granular materials known as Discrete Element Method (DEM) by additional properties such as the thermodynamic state, stress/strain for each particle. Such DEM simulations used by industries to set up their experimental processes are complexes and heavy in computation time. At each time step, those simulations generate a list of interacting particles and this phase is one of the most computationally expensive parts of a DEM simulation. The Verlet buffer method, initially introduced in Molecular Dynamic (MD) (and also used in DEM), allows keeping the interaction list for many time steps by extending each particle neighbourhood by a certain extension range, and thus broadening the interaction list. The method relies on the temporal coherency of DEM, which guarantees that no particles move erratically from one time step to the next. In the classical approach, all the particles have their neighbourhood extended by the same value which leads to suboptimal performances in simulations where different flow regimes coexist. Additionally, and unlike in MD, there is no comprehensive study analysing the different parameters that affect the performance of the Verlet buffer method in DEM. In this work, we propose a new method for the dynamic update of the neighbour list that depends on the particles individual displacement and define a particle-specific extension range based on the local flow regime. The interaction list is analysed throughout the simulation based on the particle's displacement allowing a flexible update according to the flow regime conditions. We evaluate the influence of the Verlet extension range on the execution time through different test cases and analyse empirically the extension range value giving the best performance. ",

    "abstract": "Automated abdominal multi-organ segmentation is a crucial yet challenging task in the computer-aided diagnosis of abdominal organ-related diseases. Although numerous deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in many medical image segmentation tasks, accurate segmentation of abdominal organs remains challenging, due to the varying sizes of abdominal organs and the ambiguous boundaries among them. In this paper, we propose a boundary-aware network (BA-Net) to segment abdominal organs on CT scans and MRI scans. This model contains a shared encoder, a boundary decoder, and a segmentation decoder. The multi-scale deep supervision strategy is adopted on both decoders, which can alleviate the issues caused by variable organ sizes. The boundary probability maps produced by the boundary decoder at each scale are used as attention to enhance the segmentation feature maps. We evaluated the BA-Net on the Abdominal Multi-Organ Segmentation (AMOS) Challenge dataset and achieved an average Dice score of 89.29$\\%$ for multi-organ segmentation on CT scans and an average Dice score of 71.92$\\%$ on MRI scans. The results demonstrate that BA-Net is superior to nnUNet on both segmentation tasks. ",

We propose Autoinverse, a highly automated approach for inverting neural network surrogates. Our main insight is to seek inverse solutions in the vicinity of reliable data which have been sampled form the forward process and used for training the surrogate model. Autoinverse finds such solutions by taking into account the predictive uncertainty of the surrogate and minimizing it during the inversion. Apart from high accuracy, Autoinverse enforces the feasibility of solutions, comes with embedded regularization, and is initialization free. We verify our proposed method through addressing a set of real-world problems in control, fabrication, and design. ",

By adding a Kullback-Liebler regularization function to the robust min-max optimization problem, the learning problem can be reduced to a modified robust minimization problem and solved efficiently. Leveraging the newly formulated optimization problem, we propose a robust version of Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (DSGD), coined Distributionally Robust Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent (DR-DSGD). Under some mild assumptions and provided that the regularization parameter is larger than one, we theoretically prove that DR-DSGD achieves a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(1/\\sqrt{KT} + K/T\\right)$, where $K$ is the number of devices and $T$ is the number of iterations. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can improve the worst distribution test accuracy by up to $10\\%$. Moreover, DR-DSGD is more communication-efficient than DSGD since it requires fewer communication rounds (up to $20$ times less) to achieve the same worst distribution test accuracy target. Furthermore, the conducted experiments reveal that DR-DSGD results in a fairer performance across devices in terms of test accuracy. ",

Since the accuracy and robustness of deep learning models are primarily attributed from the purity of the training samples, therefore the deep learning architectures are often susceptible to adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks are often obtained by making subtle perturbations to normal images, which are mostly imperceptible to humans, but can seriously confuse the state-of-the-art machine learning models. We propose a framework, named APuDAE, leveraging Denoising AutoEncoders (DAEs) to purify these samples by using them in an adaptive way and thus improve the classification accuracy of the target classifier networks that have been attacked. We also show how using DAEs adaptively instead of using them directly, improves classification accuracy further and is more robust to the possibility of designing adaptive attacks to fool them. We demonstrate our results over MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet dataset and show how our framework (APuDAE) provides comparable and in most cases better performance to the baseline methods in purifying adversaries. We also design adaptive attack specifically designed to attack our purifying model and demonstrate how our defense is robust to that. ",

We propose ProspectNet, a joint learning block that adopts the weighted attention score to model the mutual influence between interactive agent pairs. The joint learning block first weighs the multi-modal predicted candidate trajectories, then updates the ego-agent's embedding via cross attention. Furthermore, we broadcast the individual future predictions for each interactive agent into a pair-wise scoring module to select the top $K$ prediction pairs.

In this paper, the computation delay from nonlinear optimization for motion planning and control, as well as other unavoidable delays caused by actuators, are addressed systematically and unifiedly. To deal with all these delays, in our framework: 1) we propose a new filtering approach with no prior knowledge of dynamics and disturbance distribution to adaptively and safely estimate the time-variant computation delay; 2) we model actuation dynamics for steering delay; 3) all the constrained optimization is realized in a robust tube model predictive controller. For the application merits, we demonstrate that our approach is suitable for both autonomous driving and autonomous racing. Our approach is a novel design for a standalone delay compensation controller. In addition, in the case that a learning-enabled controller assuming no delay works as a primary controller, our approach serves as the primary controller's safety guard. ",

Further, the model efficacy is evaluated with implementation in one of the communication networks of a cyber-physical power system.

Transformers are usually pre-trained on large unsupervised corpora, learning token representations and transformations relevant to modeling generally available text, and are then fine-tuned on a particular downstream task of interest. While fine-tuning is a tried-and-true method for adapting a model to a new domain -- for example, question-answering on a given topic -- generalization remains an on-going challenge. In this paper, we explore and evaluate transformer model fine-tuning for personalization. In the context of generating unit tests for Java methods, we evaluate learning to personalize to a specific software project using several personalization techniques. We consider three key approaches: (i) custom fine-tuning, which allows all the model parameters to be tuned; (ii) lightweight fine-tuning, which freezes most of the model's parameters, allowing tuning of the token embeddings and softmax layer only or the final layer alone; (iii) prefix tuning, which keeps model parameters frozen, but optimizes a small project-specific prefix vector. Each of these techniques offers a trade-off in total compute cost and predictive performance, which we evaluate by code and task-specific metrics, training time, and total computational operations. We compare these fine-tuning strategies for code generation and discuss the potential generalization and cost benefits of each in various deployment scenarios. ",

We hypothesise that synthetic outliers need only be minimally perturbed variants of the in-distribution (ID) data in order to train a discriminator to identify OOD samples -- without expensive retraining of the base network. To test our hypothesis, we generate a synthetic outlier set by applying an additive-noise perturbation to ID samples at the image or bounding-box level. An auxiliary feature monitoring multilayer perceptron (MLP) is then trained to detect OOD feature representations using the perturbed ID samples as a proxy. During testing, we demonstrate that the auxiliary MLP distinguishes ID samples from OOD samples at a state-of-the-art level, reducing the false positive rate by more than 20\\% (absolute) over the previous state-of-the-art on the OpenImages dataset. Extensive additional ablations provide empirical evidence in support of our hypothesis. ",

Thus, the architecture of the neural network model significantly impacts the communication payload size, model accuracy, and computational load. In this paper, we address the challenge of optimizing neural network architecture for split computing. To this end, we proposed NASC, which jointly explores optimal model architecture and a split point to achieve higher accuracy while meeting latency requirements (i.e., smaller total latency of computation and communication than a certain threshold). NASC employs a one-shot NAS that does not require repeating model training for a computationally efficient architecture search. Our performance evaluation using hardware (HW)-NAS-Bench of benchmark data demonstrates that the proposed NASC can improve the ``communication latency and model accuracy\" trade-off, i.e., reduce the latency by approximately 40-60% from the baseline, with slight accuracy degradation.

    "abstract": "Source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA) aims to learn a target domain model using unlabeled target data and the knowledge of a well-trained source domain model. Most previous SFUDA works focus on inferring semantics of target data based on the source knowledge. Without measuring the transferability of the source knowledge, these methods insufficiently exploit the source knowledge, and fail to identify the reliability of the inferred target semantics. However, existing transferability measurements require either source data or target labels, which are infeasible in SFUDA. To this end, firstly, we propose a novel Uncertainty-induced Transferability Representation (UTR), which leverages uncertainty as the tool to analyse the channel-wise transferability of the source encoder in the absence of the source data and target labels. The domain-level UTR unravels how transferable the encoder channels are to the target domain and the instance-level UTR characterizes the reliability of the inferred target semantics. Secondly, based on the UTR, we propose a novel Calibrated Adaption Framework (CAF) for SFUDA, including i)the source knowledge calibration module that guides the target model to learn the transferable source knowledge and discard the non-transferable one, and ii)the target semantics calibration module that calibrates the unreliable semantics. With the help of the calibrated source knowledge and the target semantics, the model adapts to the target domain safely and ultimately better. We verified the effectiveness of our method using experimental results and demonstrated that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on the three SFUDA benchmarks.

    "title": "Prediction of Red Wine Quality Using One-dimensional Convolutional  Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "As an alcoholic beverage, wine has remained prevalent for thousands of years, and the quality assessment of wines has been significant in wine production and trade. Scholars have proposed various deep learning and machine learning algorithms for wine quality prediction, such as Support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Deep neural network (DNN), and Logistic regression (LR). However, these methods ignore the inner relationship between the physical and chemical properties of the wine, for example, the correlations between pH values, fixed acidity, citric acid, and so on. To fill the gap, this paper conducts the Pearson correlation analysis, PCA analysis, and Shapiro-Wilk test on those properties and incorporates 1D-CNN architecture to capture the correlations among neighboring features. In addition, it implemented dropout and batch normalization techniques to improve the robustness of the proposed model. Massive experiments have shown that our method can outperform baseline approaches in wine quality prediction. Moreover, ablation experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating the 1-D CNN module, Dropout, and normalization techniques. ",

Likelihoods learned by a generative model, e.g., a normalizing flow via standard log-likelihood training, perform poorly as an anomaly score. We propose to use an unlabelled auxiliary dataset and a probabilistic outlier score for anomaly detection. We use a self-supervised feature extractor trained on the auxiliary dataset and train a normalizing flow on the extracted features by maximizing the likelihood on in-distribution data and minimizing the likelihood on the auxiliary dataset. We show that this is equivalent to learning the normalized positive difference between the in-distribution and the auxiliary feature density.

    "abstract": "Opinion dynamics on social networks have been received considerable attentions in recent years. Nevertheless, just a few works have theoretically analyzed the condition in which a certain opinion can spread in the whole structured population. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game approach for a binary opinion model to explore the conditions for an opinion's spreading. Inspired by real-life observations, we assume that an agent's choice to select an opinion is not random, but is based on a score rooted both from public knowledge and the interactions with neighbors. By means of coalescing random walks, we obtain a condition in which opinion $A$ can be favored to spread on social networks in the weak selection limit. We find that the successfully spreading condition of opinion $A$ is closely related to the basic scores of binary opinions, the feedback scores on opinion interactions, and the structural parameters including the edge weights, the weighted degrees of vertices, and the average degree of the network. In particular, when individuals adjust their opinions based solely on the public information, the vitality of opinion $A$ depends exclusively on the difference of basic scores of $A$ and $B$. When there are no negative (positive) feedback interactions between connected individuals, we find that the success of opinion $A$ depends on the ratio of the obtained positive (negative) feedback scores of competing opinions. To complete our study, we perform computer simulations on fully-connected, small-world, and scale-free networks, respectively, which support and confirm our theoretical findings. ",

Experiments show the flexibility and efficiency under extreme scenarios: It successes to serve an ensemble of 12 heavy DNNs into 4 GPUs and at the opposite, one single DNN multi-threaded into 16 GPUs.

    "abstract": "To improve the overall performance of processors, computer architects use various performance optimization techniques in modern processors, such as speculative execution, branch prediction, and chaotic execution. Both now and in the future, these optimization techniques are critical for improving the execution speed of processor instructions. However, researchers have discovered that these techniques introduce hidden inherent security flaws, such as meltdown and ghost attacks in recent years. They exploit techniques such as chaotic execution or speculative execution combined with cache-based side-channel attacks to leak protected data. The impact of these vulnerabilities is enormous because they are prevalent in existing or future processors. However, until today, meltdown and ghost have not been effectively addressed, but instead, multiple attack variants and different attack implementations have evolved from them. This paper proposes to optimize four different hardware performance events through feature selection and use machine learning algorithms to build a real-time detection mechanism for Spectre v1,v2,v4, and different implementations of meltdown attacks, ultimately achieving an accuracy rate of over 99\\%. In order to verify the practicality of the attack detection model, this paper is tested with a variety of benign programs and different implementations of Spectre attacks different from the modeling process, and the absolute accuracy also exceeds 99\\%, showing that this paper can cope with different attack variants and different implementations of the same attack that may occur daily.

    "abstract": "Representation learning on temporal graphs has drawn considerable research attention owing to its fundamental importance in a wide spectrum of real-world applications. Though a number of studies succeed in obtaining time-dependent representations, it still faces significant challenges. On the one hand, most of the existing methods restrict the embedding space with a certain curvature. However, the underlying geometry in fact shifts among the positive curvature hyperspherical, zero curvature Euclidean and negative curvature hyperbolic spaces in the evolvement over time. On the other hand, these methods usually require abundant labels to learn temporal representations, and thereby notably limit their wide use in the unlabeled graphs of the real applications. To bridge this gap, we make the first attempt to study the problem of self-supervised temporal graph representation learning in the general Riemannian space, supporting the time-varying curvature to shift among hyperspherical, Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces. In this paper, we present a novel self-supervised Riemannian graph neural network (SelfRGNN). Specifically, we design a curvature-varying Riemannian GNN with a theoretically grounded time encoding, and formulate a functional curvature over time to model the evolvement shifting among the positive, zero and negative curvature spaces. To enable the self-supervised learning, we propose a novel reweighting self-contrastive approach, exploring the Riemannian space itself without augmentation, and propose an edge-based self-supervised curvature learning with the Ricci curvature. Extensive experiments show the superiority of SelfRGNN, and moreover, the case study shows the time-varying curvature of temporal graph in reality. ",

In this paper, we attempt to build a deep learning model that mimics all four steps in the traditional homography estimation pipeline. In particular, the feature matching step is implemented using the cost volume technique. To remove outliers in the cost volume, we treat this outlier removal problem as a denoising problem and propose a novel self-supervised loss to solve the problem.

These approaches often utilize a StyleCLIP-based image generator, which leverages multi-modal (text and image) embedding space. However, we observe that such text inputs are often bottlenecked in providing and synthesizing rich semantic cues, e.g., differentiating heavy rain from rain with thunderstorms. To address this issue, we advocate leveraging an additional modality, sound, which has notable advantages in image manipulation as it can convey more diverse semantic cues (vivid emotions or dynamic expressions of the natural world) than texts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that first extends the image-text joint embedding space with sound and applies a direct latent optimization method to manipulate a given image based on audio input, e.g., the sound of rain. Our extensive experiments show that our sound-guided image manipulation approach produces semantically and visually more plausible manipulation results than the state-of-the-art text and sound-guided image manipulation methods, which are further confirmed by our human evaluations. Our downstream task evaluations also show that our learned image-text-sound joint embedding space effectively encodes sound inputs. ",

(ii) The algorithm does not require all-time connectivity but instead uniform connectivity over some non-overlapping finite time intervals. First, we prove that our algorithm provides primal-feasible allocation at every iteration step and converges under the conditions (i)-(ii) and some other mild conditions on the nonlinear iterative dynamics. These nonlinearities address possible practical constraints in real applications due to, for example, saturation or quantization among others.

    "abstract": "Backdoor-based watermarking schemes were proposed to protect the intellectual property of artificial intelligence models, especially deep neural networks, under the black-box setting. Compared with ordinary backdoors, backdoor-based watermarks need to digitally incorporate the owner's identity, which fact adds extra requirements to the trigger generation and verification programs. Moreover, these concerns produce additional security risks after the watermarking scheme has been published for as a forensics tool or the owner's evidence has been eavesdropped on. This paper proposes the capsulation attack, an efficient method that can invalidate most established backdoor-based watermarking schemes without sacrificing the pirated model's functionality. By encapsulating the deep neural network with a rule-based or Bayes filter, an adversary can block ownership probing and reject the ownership verification. We propose a metric, CAScore, to measure a backdoor-based watermarking scheme's security against the capsulation attack. This paper also proposes a new backdoor-based deep neural network watermarking scheme that is secure against the capsulation attack by reversing the encoding process and randomizing the exposure of triggers.

Despite this, identifying the true latent causal representation from observed data is a great challenge. In this work we focus on identifying latent causal variables. To this end, we analysis three intrinsic properties in latent space, including transitivity, permutation and scaling. We show that the transitivity severely hinders the identifiability of latent causal variables, while permutation and scaling guide the direction of identifying latent causal variable. To break the transitivity, we assume the underlying latent causal relations to be linear Gaussian models, in which the weights, mean and variance of Gaussian noise are modulated by an additionally observed variable. Under these assumptions we theoretically show that the latent causal variables can be identifiable up to trivial permutation and scaling. Built on this theoretical result, we propose a novel method, termed Structural caUsAl Variational autoEncoder, which directly learns latent causal variables, together with the mapping from the latent causal variables to the observed ones. Experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the identifiable result and the ability of the proposed method for learning latent causal variables. ",

Although using multi-scale patches to encode the geometry of a point has become the common wisdom in PCD, we find that simple aggregation of extracted multi-scale features can not adaptively utilize the appropriate scale information according to the geometric information around noisy points. It leads to surface degradation, especially for points close to edges and points on complex curved surfaces. We raise an intriguing question -- if employing multi-scale geometric perception information to guide the network to utilize multi-scale information, can eliminate the severe surface degradation problem? To answer it, we propose a Multi-offset Denoising Network (MODNet) customized for multi-scale patches. First, we extract the low-level feature of three scales patches by patch feature encoders. Second, a multi-scale perception module is designed to embed multi-scale geometric information for each scale feature and regress multi-scale weights to guide a multi-offset denoising displacement. Third, a multi-offset decoder regresses three scale offsets, which are guided by the multi-scale weights to predict the final displacement by weighting them adaptively.

    "title": "Identifying Latent Causal Content for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation",
    "abstract": "Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) learns to predict the labels in target domain data, under the setting where all data from multiple source domains are labelled and the data from the target domain are unlabeled. To handle this problem, most of methods focus on learning invariant representations across domains. However, their success severely relies on the assumption that label distribution remains unchanged across domains. To mitigate it, we propose a new assumption, latent covariate shift, where the marginal distribution of the latent content variable changes across domains, and the conditional distribution of the label given the latent content remains invariant across domains. We introduce a latent style variable to complement the latent content variable forming a latent causal graph as the data and label generating process. We show that although the latent style variable is unidentifiable due to transitivity property in the latent space, the latent content variable can be identified up to simple scaling under some mild conditions. This motivates us to propose a novel method for MSDA, which learns the invariant label distribution conditional on the latent content variable, instead of learning invariant representations. Empirical evaluation on simulation and real data demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, compared with many state-of-the-art methods based on invariant representation. ",

    "abstract": "The binary code similarity detection (BCSD) method measures the similarity of two binary executable codes. Recently, the learning-based BCSD methods have achieved great success, outperforming traditional BCSD in detection accuracy and efficiency. However, the existing studies are rather sparse on the adversarial vulnerability of the learning-based BCSD methods, which cause hazards in security-related applications. To evaluate the adversarial robustness, this paper designs an efficient and black-box adversarial code generation algorithm, namely, FuncFooler. FuncFooler constrains the adversarial codes 1) to keep unchanged the program's control flow graph (CFG), and 2) to preserve the same semantic meaning. Specifically, FuncFooler consecutively 1) determines vulnerable candidates in the malicious code, 2) chooses and inserts the adversarial instructions from the benign code, and 3) corrects the semantic side effect of the adversarial code to meet the constraints. Empirically, our FuncFooler can successfully attack the three learning-based BCSD models, including SAFE, Asm2Vec, and jTrans, which calls into question whether the learning-based BCSD is desirable.

Segmentation is a dense prediction task for which the model's outcome for each pixel depends on its surroundings. The receptive field and the reliance on context play a role for distinguishing different classes and, correspondingly, for spotting OoD entities.

However, commercial mmWave radars feature a limited range (up to 6-8 m) and are subject to occlusion, which may constitute a significant drawback in large industrial settings containing machinery and obstacles. Thus, covering large indoor spaces requires multiple radars with known relative position and orientation. As a result, we necessitate algorithms to combine their outputs. In this work, we present ORACLE, an autonomous system that (i) integrates automatic relative position and orientation estimation from multiple radar devices by exploiting the trajectories of people moving freely in the radars' common fields of view and (ii) fuses the tracking information from multiple radars to obtain a unified tracking among all sensors. Our implementation and experimental evaluation of ORACLE results in median errors of 0.18 m and 2.86{\\deg} for radars location and orientation estimates, respectively. The fused tracking improves upon single sensor tracking by 6%, in terms of mean tracking accuracy, while reaching a mean tracking error as low as 0.14 m. Finally, ORACLE is robust to fusion relative time synchronization mismatches between -20% and +50%. ",

We also explore the association between online action detection and its counterpart offline action segmentation as an auxiliary task. We find that such an extra supervision helps discriminative history clustering and acts as feature augmentation for better training the classifier and cascade refinement.

Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach to overcome current limitations imposed by the dimensionality of the parameter space and multimodal parameter distributions. Most traditional optimization routines assume an invertible one-to-one mapping between the design parameters and the target performance. However, comparable or even identical performance may be realized by different designs, yielding a multimodal distribution of possible solutions to the inverse design problem which confuses the optimization algorithm. Here, we show how a generative modeling approach based on invertible neural networks can provide the full distribution of possible solutions to the inverse design problem and resolve the ambiguity of nanodevice inverse design problems featuring multimodal distributions. We implement a Conditional Invertible Neural Network (cINN) and apply it to a proof-of-principle nanophotonic problem, consisting in tailoring the transmission spectrum of a metallic film milled by subwavelength indentations. We compare our approach with the commonly used conditional Variational Autoencoder (cVAE) framework and show the superior flexibility and accuracy of the proposed cINNs when dealing with multimodal device distributions. Our work shows that invertible neural networks provide a valuable and versatile toolkit for advancing inverse design in nanoscience and nanotechnology. ",

    "abstract": "Node similarity scores constitute a foundation for machine learning in graphs. Besides clustering, node classification, and anomaly detection, they are a basis for link prediction with critical applications in biological systems, information networks, and recommender systems. Recent works on link prediction use vector space embeddings to calculate node similarities. While these methods can provide good performance in undirected networks, they have several disadvantages: limited interpretability, problem-specific hyperparameter tuning, manual model fitting through dimensionality reduction, and poor performance of symmetric similarities in directed link prediction. To address these issues, we propose MapSim, a novel information-theoretic approach to assess node similarities based on modular compression of network flows. Different from vector space embeddings, MapSim represents nodes in a discrete, non-metric space of communities and yields asymmetric similarities suitable to predict directed and undirected links in an unsupervised fashion. The resulting similarities can be explained based on a network's hierarchical modular organisation, facilitating interpretability. MapSim naturally accounts for Occam's razor, leading to parsimonious representations of clusters at multiple scales. Addressing unsupervised link prediction, we compare MapSim to popular embedding-based algorithms across 47 data sets of networks from a few hundred to hundreds of thousands of nodes and millions of links. Our analysis shows that MapSim's average performance across all networks is more than 7% higher than its closest competitor, outperforming all embedding methods in 14 of the 47 networks, and a more than 33% better worst-case performance. Our method demonstrates the potential of compression-based approaches in graph representation learning, with promising applications in other graph learning tasks. ",

Automatically extract the vital information from AV labels will greatly enhance the detection ability of security enterprises and equip the research ability of security analysts. Recent works like AVCLASS and AVCLASS2 try to extract the attributes of malware from AV labels and establish the taxonomy based on expert knowledge.

AVMiner adopts natural language processing techniques and clustering methods to generate a sequence of tokens without expert knowledge ranked by importance. AVMiner can self-update when new samples come. Finally, we evaluate AVMiner on over 8,000 samples from well-known datasets with manually labeled ground truth, which outperforms previous works. ",

    "abstract": "On-shelf utility mining (OSUM) is an emerging research direction in data mining. It aims to discover itemsets that have high relative utility in their selling time period. Compared with traditional utility mining, OSUM can find more practical and meaningful patterns in real-life applications. However, there is a major drawback to traditional OSUM. For normal users, it is hard to define a minimum threshold minutil for mining the right amount of on-shelf high utility itemsets. On one hand, if the threshold is set too high, the number of patterns would not be enough. On the other hand, if the threshold is set too low, too many patterns will be discovered and cause an unnecessary waste of time and memory consumption. To address this issue, the user usually directly specifies a parameter k, where only the top-k high relative utility itemsets would be considered. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a generic algorithm named TOIT for mining Top-k On-shelf hIgh-utility paTterns to solve this problem. TOIT applies a novel strategy to raise the minutil based on the on-shelf datasets. Besides, two novel upper-bound strategies named subtree utility and local utility are applied to prune the search space. By adopting the strategies mentioned above, the TOIT algorithm can narrow the search space as early as possible, improve the mining efficiency, and reduce the memory consumption, so it can obtain better performance than other algorithms. A series of experiments have been conducted on real datasets with different styles to compare the effects with the state-of-the-art KOSHU algorithm. The experimental results showed that TOIT outperforms KOSHU in both running time and memory consumption. ",

For this system, we characterize the fundamental type-II error exponents region, i.e., the type-II error exponents that the various DCs can achieve simultaneously, under expected rate-constraints. Our results show that this fundamental exponents region is boosted compared to the region under maximum-rate constraints, and that it depends on the permissible type-I error probabilities. When all DCs have equal permissible type-I error probabilities, the exponents region is rectangular and all DCs can simultaneously achieve their optimal type-II error exponents. When the DCs have different permissible type-I error probabilities, a tradeoff between the type-II error exponents at the different DCs arises. New achievability and converse proofs are presented. For the achievability, a new multiplexing and rate-sharing strategy is proposed. The converse proof is based on applying different change of measure arguments in parallel and on proving asymptotic Markov chains. For the special cases $K = 2$ and $K = 3$, we provide simplified expressions for the exponents region; a similar simplification is conjectured for arbitrary $K\\geq 2$. ",

In this paper, we propose a new framework for detecting sentences that create differences in emotion recognition between the writer and the reader and for detecting the kinds of expressions that cause such differences. The proposed framework consists of a bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)-based detector that detects sentences causing differences in emotion recognition and an analysis that acquires expressions that characteristically appear in such sentences. The detector, based on a Japanese SNS-document dataset with emotion labels annotated by both the writer and three readers of the social networking service (SNS) documents, detected \"hidden-anger sentences\" with AUC = 0.772; these sentences gave rise to differences in the recognition of anger. Because SNS documents contain many sentences whose meaning is extremely difficult to interpret, by analyzing the sentences detected by this detector, we obtained several expressions that appear characteristically in hidden-anger sentences. The detected sentences and expressions do not convey anger explicitly, and it is difficult to infer the writer's anger, but if the implicit anger is pointed out, it becomes possible to guess why the writer is angry. Put into practical use, this framework would likely have the ability to mitigate problems based on misunderstandings. ",

Coloring such graphs has applications in routing edges in layered orthogonal graph drawing according to the Sugiyama framework; the colors correspond to the tracks for routing the edges. We show how to recognize directional interval graphs, and how to compute their chromatic number efficiently.

Among other things, such a model must be able to: (a) identify and record new characters (entities) and their attributes as they are introduced in the text, and (b) identify subsequent references to the characters previously introduced and update their attributes. This problem of entity tracking is essential for language understanding, and thus, useful for a wide array of downstream applications in NLP such as question-answering, summarization. In this thesis, we focus on two key problems in relation to facilitating the use of entity tracking models: (i) scaling entity tracking models to long documents, such as a novel, and (ii) integrating entity tracking into language models. Applying language technologies to long documents has garnered interest recently, but computational constraints are a significant bottleneck in scaling up current methods. In this thesis, we argue that computationally efficient entity tracking models can be developed by representing entities with rich, fixed-dimensional vector representations derived from pretrained language models, and by exploiting the ephemeral nature of entities. We also argue for the integration of entity tracking into language models as it will allow for: (i) wider application given the current ubiquitous use of pretrained language models in NLP applications, and (ii) easier adoption since it is much easier to swap in a new pretrained language model than to integrate a separate standalone entity tracking model.

Existing 3D deep learning generative models (e.g., VAE, GANs) allow generating compact face representations (both shape and texture) that can model non-linearities in the shape and appearance space (e.g., scatter effects, specularities, etc.). However, they lack the capability to control the generation of subtle expressions. This paper proposes a new 3D face generative model that can decouple identity and expression and provides granular control over expressions. In particular, we propose using a pair of supervised auto-encoder and generative adversarial networks to produce high-quality 3D faces, both in terms of appearance and shape. Experimental results in the generation of 3D faces learned with holistic expression labels, or Action Unit labels, show how we can decouple identity and expression; gaining fine-control over expressions while preserving identity.

    "abstract": "Quantization is a technique to reduce the computation and memory cost of DNN models, which are getting increasingly large. Existing quantization solutions use fixed-point integer or floating-point types, which have limited benefits, as both require more bits to maintain the accuracy of original models. On the other hand, variable-length quantization uses low-bit quantization for normal values and high-precision for a fraction of outlier values. Even though this line of work brings algorithmic benefits, it also introduces significant hardware overheads due to variable-length encoding and decoding. In this work, we propose a fixed-length adaptive numerical data type called ANT to achieve low-bit quantization with tiny hardware overheads. Our data type ANT leverages two key innovations to exploit the intra-tensor and inter-tensor adaptive opportunities in DNN models. First, we propose a particular data type, flint, that combines the advantages of float and int for adapting to the importance of different values within a tensor. Second, we propose an adaptive framework that selects the best type for each tensor according to its distribution characteristics.

    "abstract": "Adversarial machine learning is an emerging area showing the vulnerability of deep learning models. Exploring attack methods to challenge state of the art artificial intelligence (A.I.) models is an area of critical concern. The reliability and robustness of such A.I. models are one of the major concerns with an increasing number of effective adversarial attack methods. Classification tasks are a major vulnerable area for adversarial attacks. The majority of attack strategies are developed for colored or gray-scaled images. Consequently, adversarial attacks on binary image recognition systems have not been sufficiently studied. Binary images are simple two possible pixel-valued signals with a single channel. The simplicity of binary images has a significant advantage compared to colored and gray scaled images, namely computation efficiency. Moreover, most optical character recognition systems (O.C.R.s), such as handwritten character recognition, plate number identification, and bank check recognition systems, use binary images or binarization in their processing steps. In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient attack method, Efficient Combinatorial Black-box Adversarial Attack, on binary image classifiers. We validate the efficiency of the attack technique on two different data sets and three classification networks, demonstrating its performance. Furthermore, we compare our proposed method with state-of-the-art methods regarding advantages and disadvantages as well as applicability. ",

Design and improvement of such microfluidic devices is a challenge to best answer the demand for producing homogeneous end-result for study and use. Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) exploits a similar principle that has drawn extensive attention over years. However, the lack of predictive understanding of the particle trajectory and its induced mode makes designing a DLD device an iterative procedure. Therefore, this paper investigates a fast versatile design automation platform to address this issue. To do so, convolutional and artificial neural networks were employed to learn velocity fields and critical diameters of a wide range of DLD configurations. Later, these networks were combined with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to construct the automation tool. After ensuring the accuracy of the neural networks, the developed tool was tested for 12 critical conditions. Reaching the imposed conditions, the automation components performed reliably with errors of less than 4%. Moreover, this tool is generalizable to other field-based problems and since the neural network is an integral part of this method, it enables transfer learning for similar physics.

The smallest $t$ for which $G$ has a tree $t$-spanner is called tree stretch index. The $t$-admissibility problem aims to decide whether the tree stretch index is at most $t$. Regarding its optimization version, the smallest $t$ for which $G$ is $t$-admissible is the stretch index of $G$, denoted by $\\sigma_T(G)$. Given a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the recognition of $2$-admissible graphs can be done $O(n+m)$ time, whereas $t$-admissibility is NP-complete for $\\sigma_T(G) \\leq t$, $t \\geq 4$ and deciding if $t = 3$ is an open problem, for more than 20 years. Since the structural knowledge of classes can be determinant to classify $3$-admissibility's complexity, in this paper we present simpler and faster algorithms to check $2$ and $3$-admissibility for families of graphs with few $P_4$'s and $(k,\\ell)$-graphs. Regarding $(0,\\ell)$-graphs, we present lower and upper bounds for the stretch index of these graphs and characterize graphs whose stretch indexes are equal to the proposed upper bound.

Recently, research has focused on modeling hyper-relational facts, which move beyond the restriction of uni-relational facts and allow us to represent more complex and real-world information. However, existing approaches for learning representations on hyper-relational KGs majorly focus on enhancing the communication from qualifiers to base triples while overlooking the flow of information from base triple to qualifiers. This can lead to suboptimal qualifier representations, especially when a large amount of qualifiers are presented. It motivates us to design a framework that utilizes multiple aggregators to learn representations for hyper-relational facts: one from the perspective of the base triple and the other one from the perspective of the qualifiers. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for hyper-relational knowledge graph completion across multiple datasets. Furthermore, we conduct an ablation study that validates the importance of the various components in our framework.

At present, most research works are based on cameras and computer vision techniques to perform gait recognition. However, vision-based methods are not reliable when confronting poor illuminations, leading to degrading performances. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal gait recognition method, namely GaitFi, which leverages WiFi signals and videos for human identification. In GaitFi, Channel State Information (CSI) that reflects the multi-path propagation of WiFi is collected to capture human gaits, while videos are captured by cameras. To learn robust gait information, we propose a Lightweight Residual Convolution Network (LRCN) as the backbone network, and further propose the two-stream GaitFi by integrating WiFi and vision features for the gait retrieval task. The GaitFi is trained by the triplet loss and classification loss on different levels of features. Extensive experiments are conducted in the real world, which demonstrates that the GaitFi outperforms state-of-the-art gait recognition methods based on single WiFi or camera, achieving 94.2% for human identification tasks of 12 subjects.

We introduce the Denoising Architecture as a complement to this LSTM Encoder-Decoder model and investigate its effect on real-world as well as artificially generated datasets.

MeloForm enjoys the advantages of precise musical form control by expert systems and musical richness learning via neural models. Both subjective and objective experimental evaluations demonstrate that MeloForm generates melodies with precise musical form control with 97.79% accuracy, and outperforms baseline systems in terms of subjective evaluation score by 0.75, 0.50, 0.86 and 0.89 in structure, thematic, richness and overall quality, without any labelled musical form data.

To this end, we first created the out-of-domain evaluation datasets, musdb-L and XL, by mimicking the music mastering process. Then, we quantitatively verify that the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms significantly deteriorated in our datasets.

    "abstract": "With the rapid development of self-supervised learning (e.g., contrastive learning), the importance of having large-scale images (even without annotations) for training a more generalizable AI model has been widely recognized in medical image analysis. However, collecting large-scale task-specific unannotated data at scale can be challenging for individual labs. Existing online resources, such as digital books, publications, and search engines, provide a new resource for obtaining large-scale images. However, published images in healthcare (e.g., radiology and pathology) consist of a considerable amount of compound figures with subplots. In order to extract and separate compound figures into usable individual images for downstream learning, we propose a simple compound figure separation (SimCFS) framework without using the traditionally required detection bounding box annotations, with a new loss function and a hard case simulation. Our technical contribution is four-fold: (1) we introduce a simulation-based training framework that minimizes the need for resource extensive bounding box annotations; (2) we propose a new side loss that is optimized for compound figure separation; (3) we propose an intra-class image augmentation method to simulate hard cases; and (4) to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the efficacy of leveraging self-supervised learning with compound image separation. From the results, the proposed SimCFS achieved state-of-the-art performance on the ImageCLEF 2016 Compound Figure Separation Database. The pretrained self-supervised learning model using large-scale mined figures improved the accuracy of downstream image classification tasks with a contrastive learning algorithm.

The obtained results indicate that it is feasible to predict these fats with a high degree of correlation, thus alleviating the requirement for manual or automatic segmentation of both fat volumes. Instead, segmenting just one of them suffices, while the volume of the other may be predicted fairly precisely. The correlation coefficient obtained by the Rotation Forest algorithm using MLP Regressor for predicting the mediastinal fat based on the epicardial fat was 0.9876, with a relative absolute error of 14.4% and a root relative squared error of 15.7%. The best correlation coefficient obtained in the prediction of the epicardial fat based on the mediastinal was 0.9683 with a relative absolute error of 19.6% and a relative squared error of 24.9%. Moreover, we analysed the feasibility of using linear regressors, which provide an intuitive interpretation of the underlying approximations. In this case, the obtained correlation coefficient was 0.9534 for predicting the mediastinal fat based on the epicardial, with a relative absolute error of 31.6% and a root relative squared error of 30.1%. On the prediction of the epicardial fat based on the mediastinal fat, the correlation coefficient was 0.8531, with a relative absolute error of 50.43% and a root relative squared error of 52.06%. In summary, it is possible to speed up general medical analyses and some segmentation and quantification methods that are currently employed in the state-of-the-art by using this prediction approach, which consequently reduces costs and therefore enables preventive treatments that may lead to a reduction of health problems.

To address upcoming strict criteria, a new open radio access network (O-RAN) with distinguishing features such as flexible design, disaggregated virtual and programmable components, and intelligent closed-loop control was developed. O-RAN slicing is being investigated as a critical strategy for ensuring network quality of service (QoS) in the face of changing circumstances. However, distinct network slices must be dynamically controlled to avoid service level agreement (SLA) variation caused by rapid changes in the environment. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel framework able to manage the network slices through provisioned resources intelligently. Due to diverse heterogeneous environments, intelligent machine learning approaches require sufficient exploration to handle the harshest situations in a wireless network and accelerate convergence. To solve this problem, a new solution is proposed based on evolutionary-based deep reinforcement learning (EDRL) to accelerate and optimize the slice management learning process in the radio access network's (RAN) intelligent controller (RIC) modules. To this end, the O-RAN slicing is represented as a Markov decision process (MDP) which is then solved optimally for resource allocation to meet service demand using the EDRL approach. In terms of reaching service demands, simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms the DRL baseline by 62.2%. ",

    "abstract": "We analyze to what extent final users can infer information about the level of protection of their data when the data obfuscation mechanism is a priori unknown to him (the so called \"black-box\" scenario). In particular, we delve into the investigation of various notions of differential privacy (DP), namely epsilon-DP, local DP, and R\\'enyi DP. On one side, we prove that, without any assumption on the underlying distributions, it is not possible to have an algorithm able to infer the level of data protection with provable guarantees. On the other side, we demonstrate that, under reasonable assumptions (namely, Lipschitzness of the involved densities on a closed interval), such guarantees exist and can be achieved by a simple histogram-based estimator. Then, by using one of the best known DP obfuscation mechanisms (namely, the Laplacian one), we test in practice that the theoretical number of samples needed to prove our bound is actually much larger than the real number needed for obtaining satisfactory results. Furthermore, we also see that the estimated epsilon is in practice much closer to the real one w.r.t. what our theorems foresee. ",

    "abstract": "While self-supervised learning has been shown to benefit a number of vision tasks, existing techniques mainly focus on image-level manipulation, which may not generalize well to downstream tasks at patch or pixel levels. Moreover, existing SSL methods might not sufficiently describe and associate the above representations within and across image scales. In this paper, we propose a Self-Supervised Pyramid Representation Learning (SS-PRL) framework. The proposed SS-PRL is designed to derive pyramid representations at patch levels via learning proper prototypes, with additional learners to observe and relate inherent semantic information within an image. In particular, we present a cross-scale patch-level correlation learning in SS-PRL, which allows the model to aggregate and associate information learned across patch scales. We show that, with our proposed SS-PRL for model pre-training, one can easily adapt and fine-tune the models for a variety of applications including multi-label classification, object detection, and instance segmentation.

Recent work has proposed the subhalo effective density slope as a more reliable observable than the commonly used subhalo mass function. The subhalo effective density slope is a measurement independent of assumptions about the underlying density profile and can be inferred for individual subhalos through traditional sampling methods. To go beyond individual subhalo measurements, we leverage recent advances in machine learning and introduce a neural likelihood-ratio estimator to infer an effective density slope for populations of subhalos. We demonstrate that our method is capable of harnessing the statistical power of multiple subhalos (within and across multiple images) to distinguish between characteristics of different subhalo populations. The computational efficiency warranted by the neural likelihood-ratio estimator over traditional sampling enables statistical studies of dark matter perturbers and is particularly useful as we expect an influx of strong lensing systems from upcoming surveys.

Although, the amount of digital data in clinical workflows is increasing, most of this data is distributed on clinical sites and protected to ensure patient privacy. Radiological readings and dealing with large-scale clinical data puts a significant burden on the available resources, and this is where machine learning and artificial intelligence play a pivotal role. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for musculoskeletal (MSK) diagnosis is one example where the scans have a wealth of information, but require a significant amount of time for reading and labeling. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can be a solution for handling the lack of availability of ground truth labels, but generally requires a large amount of training data during the pretraining stage. Herein, we propose a slice-based self-supervised deep learning framework (SB-SSL), a novel slice-based paradigm for classifying abnormality using knee MRI scans. We show that for a limited number of cases (<1000), our proposed framework is capable to identify anterior cruciate ligament tear with an accuracy of 89.17% and an AUC of 0.954, outperforming state-of-the-art without usage of external data during pretraining. This demonstrates that our proposed framework is suited for SSL in the limited data regime. ",

There is a need for a portable and cost-effective device for long-term monitoring and quantification of various bio-aerosols. To address this need, we present a mobile and cost-effective label-free bio-aerosol sensor that takes holographic images of flowing particulate matter concentrated by a virtual impactor, which selectively slows down and guides particles larger than ~6 microns to fly through an imaging window. The flowing particles are illuminated by a pulsed laser diode, casting their inline holograms on a CMOS image sensor in a lens-free mobile imaging device. The illumination contains three short pulses with a negligible shift of the flowing particle within one pulse, and triplicate holograms of the same particle are recorded at a single frame before it exits the imaging field-of-view, revealing different perspectives of each particle. The particles within the virtual impactor are localized through a differential detection scheme, and a deep neural network classifies the aerosol type in a label-free manner, based on the acquired holographic images. We demonstrated the success of this mobile bio-aerosol detector with a virtual impactor using different types of pollen (i.e., bermuda, elm, oak, pine, sycamore, and wheat) and achieved a blind classification accuracy of 92.91%. This mobile and cost-effective device weighs ~700 g and can be used for label-free sensing and quantification of various bio-aerosols over extended periods since it is based on a cartridge-free virtual impactor that does not capture or immobilize particulate matter.

EF is estimated from cardiac ultrasound videos known as echocardiograms (echo) by manually tracing the left ventricle and estimating its volume on certain frames. These estimations exhibit high inter-observer variability due to the manual process and varying video quality. Such sources of inaccuracy and the need for rapid assessment necessitate reliable and explainable machine learning techniques. In this work, we introduce EchoGNN, a model based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to estimate EF from echo videos. Our model first infers a latent echo-graph from the frames of one or multiple echo cine series. It then estimates weights over nodes and edges of this graph, indicating the importance of individual frames that aid EF estimation. A GNN regressor uses this weighted graph to predict EF. We show, qualitatively and quantitatively, that the learned graph weights provide explainability through identification of critical frames for EF estimation, which can be used to determine when human intervention is required. On EchoNet-Dynamic public EF dataset, EchoGNN achieves EF prediction performance that is on par with state of the art and provides explainability, which is crucial given the high inter-observer variability inherent in this task.

    "abstract": "Fluoroscopy is an imaging technique that uses X-ray to obtain a real-time 2D video of the interior of a 3D object, helping surgeons to observe pathological structures and tissue functions especially during intervention. However, it suffers from heavy noise that mainly arises from the clinical use of a low dose X-ray, thereby necessitating the technology of fluoroscopy denoising. Such denoising is challenged by the relative motion between the object being imaged and the X-ray imaging system. We tackle this challenge by proposing a self-supervised, three-stage framework that exploits the domain knowledge of fluoroscopy imaging. (i) Stabilize: we first construct a dynamic panorama based on optical flow calculation to stabilize the non-stationary background induced by the motion of the X-ray detector. (ii) Decompose: we then propose a novel mask-based Robust Principle Component Analysis (RPCA) decomposition method to separate a video with detector motion into a low-rank background and a sparse foreground. Such a decomposition accommodates the reading habit of experts. (iii) Denoise: we finally denoise the background and foreground separately by a self-supervised learning strategy and fuse the denoised parts into the final output via a bilateral, spatiotemporal filter. To assess the effectiveness of our work, we curate a dedicated fluoroscopy dataset of 27 videos (1,568 frames) and corresponding ground truth. Our experiments demonstrate that it achieves significant improvements in terms of denoising and enhancement effects when compared with standard approaches. Finally, expert rating confirms this efficacy. ",

    "abstract": "Many fundamental properties of a quantum system are captured by its Hamiltonian and ground state. Despite the significance of ground states preparation (GSP), this task is classically intractable for large-scale Hamiltonians. Quantum neural networks (QNNs), which exert the power of modern quantum machines, have emerged as a leading protocol to conquer this issue. As such, how to enhance the performance of QNNs becomes a crucial topic in GSP. Empirical evidence showed that QNNs with handcraft symmetric ansatzes generally experience better trainability than those with asymmetric ansatzes, while theoretical explanations have not been explored. To fill this knowledge gap, here we propose the effective quantum neural tangent kernel (EQNTK) and connect this concept with over-parameterization theory to quantify the convergence of QNNs towards the global optima. We uncover that the advance of symmetric ansatzes attributes to their large EQNTK value with low effective dimension, which requests few parameters and quantum circuit depth to reach the over-parameterization regime permitting a benign loss landscape and fast convergence. Guided by EQNTK, we further devise a symmetric pruning (SP) scheme to automatically tailor a symmetric ansatz from an over-parameterized and asymmetric one to greatly improve the performance of QNNs when the explicit symmetry information of Hamiltonian is unavailable. Extensive numerical simulations are conducted to validate the analytical results of EQNTK and the effectiveness of SP. ",

    "abstract": "Several chronic lung diseases, like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are characterised by abnormal dilatation of the airways. Quantification of airway features on computed tomography (CT) can help characterise disease progression. Physics based airway measurement algorithms have been developed, but have met with limited success in part due to the sheer diversity of airway morphology seen in clinical practice. Supervised learning methods are also not feasible due to the high cost of obtaining precise airway annotations. We propose synthesising airways by style transfer using perceptual losses to train our model, Airway Transfer Network (ATN). We compare our ATN model with a state-of-the-art GAN-based network (simGAN) using a) qualitative assessment; b) assessment of the ability of ATN and simGAN based CT airway metrics to predict mortality in a population of 113 patients with IPF. ATN was shown to be quicker and easier to train than simGAN. ATN-based airway measurements were also found to be consistently stronger predictors of mortality than simGAN-derived airway metrics on IPF CTs. Airway synthesis by a transformation network that refines synthetic data using perceptual losses is a realistic alternative to GAN-based methods for clinical CT analyses of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Our source code can be found at https://github.com/ashkanpakzad/ATN that is compatible with the existing open-source airway analysis framework, AirQuant. ",

In addition, we develop a new learning scheme by splitting the time series (q_i, p_i) into several partitions, and then train a leap-frog neural network (LFNN) to approximate the generating function between the first (i.e. initial condition) and one of the rest partitions. For predicting the system evolution in a short timescale, the LFNN could effectively avoid the issue of accumulative error. Then the LFNN is applied to learn the behavior of the 2:3 resonant Kuiper belt objects, in a much longer time period, and there are two significant improvements on the neural network constructed in our previous work (Li et al. 2022): (1) conservation of the Jacobi integral ; (2) highly accurate prediction of the orbital evolution. We propose that the LFNN may be useful to make the prediction of the long time evolution of the Hamiltonian system. ",

The result is a multicriterion optimization competing the nominal (uncertainty-free) fidelity with a well known robustness measure: the size of an interaction (error) Hamiltonian, essentially the first term in the Magnus expansion of an interaction unitary. Combining this with the fact that the topology of the control landscape at high fidelity is determined by the null space of the nominal fidelity Hessian, we arrive at a new two-stage algorithm. Once the nominal fidelity is sufficiently high, we approximate both the nominal fidelity and robustness measure as quadratics in the control increments. An optimal solution is obtained by solving a convex optimization for the control increments at each iteration to keep the nominal fidelity high and reduce the robustness measure. Additionally, by separating fidelity from the robustness measure, more flexibility is available for uncertainty modeling. ",

The scheme is based on a global centre-manifold reduction where one considers the solution of the QCGLE as the composition of individual pulses plus a remainder function, which is orthogonal to the adjoint eigenfunctions of the linearised operator about a single pulse. This centre-manifold projection overcomes the difficulties of other, more orthodox, numerical schemes, by yielding a fast-slow system describing 'slow' ordinary differential equations for the locations and phases of the individual pulses, and a 'fast' partial differential equation for the remainder function. With small parameter $\\epsilon=e^{-\\lambda_r d}$ where $\\lambda_r$ is a constant and $d>0$ is the pulse separation distance, we write the fast-slow system in terms of first-order and second-order correction terms only, a formulation which is solved more efficiently than the full system. This fast-slow system is integrated numerically using adaptive time-stepping. Results are presented here for two- and three-pulse interactions. For the two-pulse problem, cells of periodic behaviour, separated by an infinite set of heteroclinic orbits, are shown to 'split' under perturbation creating complex spiral behaviour. For the case of three pulse interaction a range of dynamics, including chaotic pulse interaction, are found. While results are presented for pulse interaction in the QCGLE, the numerical scheme can also be applied to a wider class of parabolic PDEs. ",

To overcome the common problems of previous work in diagnosing reactor accidents using deep learning theory, this paper proposes a diagnostic process that ensures robustness to noisy and crippled data and is interpretable. First, a novel Denoising Padded Autoencoder (DPAE) is proposed for representation extraction of monitoring data, with representation extractor still effective on disturbed data with signal-to-noise ratios up to 25.0 and monitoring data missing up to 40.0%. Secondly, a diagnostic framework using DPAE encoder for extraction of representations followed by shallow statistical learning algorithms is proposed, and such stepwise diagnostic approach is tested on disturbed datasets with 41.8% and 80.8% higher classification and regression task evaluation metrics, in comparison with the end-to-end diagnostic approaches. Finally, a hierarchical interpretation algorithm using SHAP and feature ablation is presented to analyze the importance of the input monitoring parameters and validate the effectiveness of the high importance parameters. The outcomes of this study provide a referential method for building robust and interpretable intelligent reactor anomaly diagnosis systems in scenarios with high safety requirements. ",

We first establish a local normal form for FO transductions, which is of independent interest. This normal form allows to prove, among other results, that the local variants of (monadic) stability and (monadic) dependence are equivalent to their non-local versions. Then we prove that the quotient partial order is a bounded distributive join-semilattice, and that the subposet of additive classes is also a bounded distributive join-semilattice. We characterize transductions of paths, cubic graphs, and cubic trees in terms of bandwidth, bounded degree, and treewidth. We establish that the classes of all graphs with pathwidth at most $k$, for $k\\geq 1$ form a strict hierarchy in the FO transduction quasiorder and leave open whether the same holds for the classes of all graphs with treewidth at most $k$. We identify the obstructions for a class to be a transduction of a class with bounded degree, leading to an interesting transduction duality formulation. Eventually, we discuss a notion of dense analogs of sparse transduction-preserved class properties, and propose several related conjectures. ",
