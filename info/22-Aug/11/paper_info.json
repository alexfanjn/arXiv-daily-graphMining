    "abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been shown to be susceptible to Trojan attacks. Neural Trojan is a type of targeted poisoning attack that embeds the backdoor into the victim and is activated by the trigger in the input space. The increasing deployment of DNNs in critical systems and the surge of outsourcing DNN training (which makes Trojan attack easier) makes the detection of Trojan attacks necessary. While Neural Trojan detection has been studied in the image domain, there is a lack of solutions in the NLP domain. In this paper, we propose a model-level Trojan detection framework by analyzing the deviation of the model output when we introduce a specially crafted perturbation to the input. Particularly, we extract the model's responses to perturbed inputs as the `signature' of the model and train a meta-classifier to determine if a model is Trojaned based on its signature. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on both a dataset of NLP models we create and a public dataset of Trojaned NLP models from TrojAI. Furthermore, we propose a lightweight variant of our detection method that reduces the detection time while preserving the detection rates. ",

    "abstract": "Action recognition is an important component to improve autonomy of physical rehabilitation devices, such as wearable robotic exoskeletons. Existing human action recognition algorithms focus on adult applications rather than pediatric ones. In this paper, we introduce BabyNet, a light-weight (in terms of trainable parameters) network structure to recognize infant reaching action from off-body stationary cameras. We develop an annotated dataset that includes diverse reaches performed while in a sitting posture by different infants in unconstrained environments (e.g., in home settings, etc.). Our approach uses the spatial and temporal connection of annotated bounding boxes to interpret onset and offset of reaching, and to detect a complete reaching action. We evaluate the efficiency of our proposed approach and compare its performance against other learning-based network structures in terms of capability of capturing temporal inter-dependencies and accuracy of detection of reaching onset and offset. Results indicate our BabyNet can attain solid performance in terms of (average) testing accuracy that exceeds that of other larger networks, and can hence serve as a light-weight data-driven framework for video-based infant reaching action recognition.

Recently, some studies have made progress in ZSC by exposing the agents to diverse partners during the training process. They usually involve self-play when training the partners, implicitly assuming that the tasks are homogeneous. However, many real-world tasks are heterogeneous, and hence previous methods may fail. In this paper, we study the heterogeneous ZSC problem for the first time and propose a general method based on coevolution, which coevolves two populations of agents and partners through three sub-processes: pairing, updating and selection. Experimental results on a collaborative cooking task show the necessity of considering the heterogeneous setting and illustrate that our proposed method is a promising solution for heterogeneous cooperative MARL.

    "abstract": "Equal temperament, in which semitones are tuned in the irrational ratio of $2^{1/12} : 1$, is best seen as a serviceable compromise, sacrificing purity for flexibility. Just intonation, in which intervals given by products of powers of $2$, $3$, and $5$, is more natural, but of limited flexibility. We propose a new scheme in which ratios of Gaussian integers form the basis of an abstract tonal system. The tritone, so problematic in just temperament, given ambiguously by $45:32$, $64:45$, $36:25$, or $25:18$, none satisfactory, is in our scheme represented by the complex ratio $1 + \\rm{i} : 1$. The major and minor whole tones, given by intervals of $\\tfrac{9}{8}$ and $\\tfrac{10}{9}$, can each be factorized into products of complex semitones, giving us a major complex semitone $\\tfrac{3}{4}(1 + \\rm{i})$ and a minor complex semitone $\\tfrac{1}{3}(3 + \\rm{i})$. The perfect third, given by the interval $\\tfrac{5}{4}$, factorizes into the product of a complex whole tone $\\tfrac{1}{2}(1 + 2\\rm{i})$ and its complex conjugate. Augmented with these supplementary tones, the resulting scheme of complex intervals based on products of powers of Gaussian primes leads very naturally to the construction of a complete system of major and minor scales in all keys.

Many datasets for SER are substantially imbalanced, where data utterances of one class (most often Neutral) are much more frequent than those of other classes. Furthermore, only a few data resources are available for many existing spoken languages. To address these problems, we exploit a GAN-based augmentation model guided by a triplet network, to improve SER performance given imbalanced and insufficient training data. We conduct experiments and demonstrate: 1) With a highly imbalanced dataset, our augmentation strategy significantly improves the SER performance (+8% recall score compared with the baseline). 2) Moreover, in a cross-lingual benchmark, where we train a model with enough source language utterances but very few target language utterances (around 50 in our experiments), our augmentation strategy brings benefits for the SER performance of all three target languages.

    "abstract": "As mobile devices and location-based services are increasingly developed in different smart city scenarios and applications, many unexpected privacy leakages have arisen due to geolocated data collection and sharing. User re-identification and other sensitive inferences are major privacy threats when geolocated data are shared with cloud-assisted applications. Significantly, four spatio-temporal points are enough to uniquely identify 95\\% of the individuals, which exacerbates personal information leakages. To tackle malicious purposes such as user re-identification, we propose an LSTM-based adversarial mechanism with representation learning to attain a privacy-preserving feature representation of the original geolocated data (i.e., mobility data) for a sharing purpose. These representations aim to maximally reduce the chance of user re-identification and full data reconstruction with a minimal utility budget (i.e., loss). We train the mechanism by quantifying privacy-utility trade-off of mobility datasets in terms of trajectory reconstruction risk, user re-identification risk, and mobility predictability. We report an exploratory analysis that enables the user to assess this trade-off with a specific loss function and its weight parameters. The extensive comparison results on four representative mobility datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed architecture in mobility privacy protection and the efficiency of the proposed privacy-preserving features extractor. We show that the privacy of mobility traces attains decent protection at the cost of marginal mobility utility. Our results also show that by exploring the Pareto optimal setting, we can simultaneously increase both privacy (45%) and utility (32%). ",

Adversaries aim to deceive the targeted Machine Learning (ML) classifier at the network edge to misclassify the incoming energy requests from microgrids. With an inference attack, an adversary can collect real-time data from the communication between smart microgrids and a 5G gNodeB to train a surrogate (i.e., shadow) model of the targeted classifier at the edge. To anticipate the associated impact of an adversary's capability to collect real-time data instances, we study five different cases, each representing different amounts of real-time data instances collected by an adversary. Out of six ML models trained on the complete dataset, K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN) is selected as the surrogate model, and through simulations, we demonstrate that the multi-stage gray-box attack is able to mislead the ML classifier and cause an Evasion Increase Rate (EIR) up to 73.2% using 40% less data than what a white-box attack needs to achieve a similar EIR.

Experimental results to evaluate the proposed CIDS-Net under the SCVIC-CIDS-2021 dataset support the hypothesis for the benefits of combining host and flow features as the proposed CIDS-Net can improve the macro F1 score of baseline solutions by 6.36% (up to 99.89%).

These are characterized as qualitative, dominated by uncertainty, human involvement with different and vague perceptions/expectations, and complex systems dynamics due to feedback relations. The FCM framework provides a participatory soft computing approach to develop consensus solutions. We demonstrate its implementation in a case study: a national-scale acute water scarcity crisis. The model has eight steps starting from collecting data from stakeholders in the form of FCMs (bi-directional graphs) represented by nodes and imprecise connections. All subsequent steps operate within a new fuzzy 2-tuple framework that overcomes previous FCM limitations through advanced processing methods, where large FCMs are fuzzified and analyzed, condensed, and aggregated using graph-theoretic measures. FCMs are simulated as Auto-Associative Neural Networks (AANN) to assess policy solutions to address the problem. In this study, very large cognitive maps were developed through interviews capturing perceptions of five different stakeholder groups taking into consideration the causes, consequences and challenges of the acute water scarcity problem in Jordan. The complex FCMs containing 186 variables comprehensively covered all aspects of water scarcity. FCMs were condensed into smaller maps in two levels. They were also combined into five stakeholder group FCMs and one whole system FCM (total 123 FCMs). AANN simulations of policy scenarios were conducted on the whole system FCM, first at the most condensed level and then moved top-down through the next two levels of granularity to explore potential solutions. These were ranked by a novel fuzzy Appropriateness criterion to provide a number of high level and effective strategies to mitigate the water crisis. ",

Previous TTA schemes assume that the test samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), even though they are often temporally correlated (non-i.i.d.) in application scenarios, e.g., autonomous driving. We discover that most existing TTA methods fail dramatically under such scenarios. Motivated by this, we present a new test-time adaptation scheme that is robust against non-i.i.d. test data streams. Our novelty is mainly two-fold: (a) Instance-Aware Batch Normalization (IABN) that corrects normalization for out-of-distribution samples, and (b) Prediction-balanced Reservoir Sampling (PBRS) that simulates i.i.d. data stream from non-i.i.d. stream in a class-balanced manner. Our evaluation with various datasets, including real-world non-i.i.d. streams, demonstrates that the proposed robust TTA not only outperforms state-of-the-art TTA algorithms in the non-i.i.d. setting, but also achieves comparable performance to those algorithms under the i.i.d. assumption.

    "abstract": "The goal of robust reinforcement learning (RL) is to learn a policy that is robust against the uncertainty in model parameters. Parameter uncertainty commonly occurs in many real-world RL applications due to simulator modeling errors, changes in the real-world system dynamics over time, and adversarial disturbances. Robust RL is typically formulated as a max-min problem, where the objective is to learn the policy that maximizes the value against the worst possible models that lie in an uncertainty set. In this work, we propose a robust RL algorithm called Robust Fitted Q-Iteration (RFQI), which uses only an offline dataset to learn the optimal robust policy. Robust RL with offline data is significantly more challenging than its non-robust counterpart because of the minimization over all models present in the robust Bellman operator. This poses challenges in offline data collection, optimization over the models, and unbiased estimation. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to overcome these challenges, resulting in our RFQI algorithm. We prove that RFQI learns a near-optimal robust policy under standard assumptions and demonstrate its superior performance on standard benchmark problems. ",

Existing synthesizers that solve this problem produce programs in domain-specific languages (DSL) that are engineered to help the synthesizer, and therefore lack nice formal properties. This limitation prevents the synthesized programs from being used in verification applications (e.g., to check complex pre-post conditions) and makes the synthesizers hard to modify due to their reliance on the given DSL. We present a constraint-based approach to synthesizing transducers, a well-studied model with strong closure and decidability properties. Our approach handles three types of specifications: (i) input-output examples, (ii) input-output types expressed as regular languages, and (iii) input/output distances that bound how many characters the transducer can modify when processing an input string. Our work is the first to support such complex specifications and it does so by using the algorithmic properties of transducers to generate constraints that can be solved using off-the-shelf SMT solvers. Our synthesis approach can be extended to many transducer models and it can be used, thanks to closure properties of transducers, to compute repairs for partially correct transducers. ",

    "abstract": "Client selection schemes are widely adopted to handle the communication-efficient problems in recent studies of Federated Learning (FL). However, the large variance of the model updates aggregated from the randomly-selected unrepresentative subsets directly slows the FL convergence. We present a novel clustering-based client selection scheme to accelerate the FL convergence by variance reduction. Simple yet effective schemes are designed to improve the clustering effect and control the effect fluctuation, therefore, generating the client subset with certain representativeness of sampling. Theoretically, we demonstrate the improvement of the proposed scheme in variance reduction. We also present the tighter convergence guarantee of the proposed method thanks to the variance reduction. Experimental results confirm the exceed efficiency of our scheme compared to alternatives. ",

    "abstract": "Online learning systems have multiple data repositories in the form of transcripts, books and questions. To enable ease of access, such systems organize the content according to a well defined taxonomy of hierarchical nature (subject-chapter-topic). The task of categorizing inputs to the hierarchical labels is usually cast as a flat multi-class classification problem. Such approaches ignore the semantic relatedness between the terms in the input and the tokens in the hierarchical labels. Alternate approaches also suffer from class imbalance when they only consider leaf level nodes as labels. To tackle the issues, we formulate the task as a dense retrieval problem to retrieve the appropriate hierarchical labels for each content. In this paper, we deal with categorizing questions. We model the hierarchical labels as a composition of their tokens and use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to fuse the information with the term representations of the content. We also propose an adaptive in-batch hard negative sampling approach which samples better negatives as the training progresses. We demonstrate that the proposed approach \\textit{TagRec++} outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on question datasets as measured by Recall@k. In addition, we demonstrate zero-shot capabilities of \\textit{TagRec++} and ability to adapt to label changes. ",

    "abstract": "Large-scale neural networks possess considerable expressive power. They are well-suited for complex learning tasks in industrial applications. However, large-scale models pose significant challenges for training under the current Federated Learning (FL) paradigm. Existing approaches for efficient FL training often leverage model parameter dropout. However, manipulating individual model parameters is not only inefficient in meaningfully reducing the communication overhead when training large-scale FL models, but may also be detrimental to the scaling efforts and model performance as shown by recent research. To address these issues, we propose the Federated Opportunistic Block Dropout (FedOBD) approach. The key novelty is that it decomposes large-scale models into semantic blocks so that FL participants can opportunistically upload quantized blocks, which are deemed to be significant towards training the model, to the FL server for aggregation. Extensive experiments evaluating FedOBD against five state-of-the-art approaches based on multiple real-world datasets show that it reduces the overall communication overhead by more than 70% compared to the best performing baseline approach, while achieving the highest test accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, FedOBD is the first approach to perform dropout on FL models at the block level rather than at the individual parameter level. ",

One of the most effective ways to monitor the AirTender functioning is to look for oil stains on its surface. Starting from real-time images, AirTender is first detected in the motorbike suspension system and then a binary classifier determines whether AirTender is spilling oil or not. The detection is made with the help of the Yolo5 architecture, whereas the classification is carried out with the help of a suitably designed Convolutional Neural Network, OilNet40. In order to detect oil leaks more clearly, we dilute the oil in AirTender with a fluorescent dye with excitation wavelength peak of approximately 390 nm. AirTender is then illuminated with suitable UV LEDs. The whole system is an attempt to design a low-cost detection setup. An on-board device, such as a mini-computer, is placed near the suspension system and connected to a full hd camera framing AirTender. The on-board device, through our Neural Network algorithm, is then able to localize and classify AirTender as normally functioning (non-leak image) or anomaly (leak image). ",

In a system with $N_t$ transmit antennas employing $M$-ary modulation, the ML-MIMO detector requires $M^{N_t}$ cost function (CF) evaluations followed by a search operation for detecting the symbol with the minimum CF value. However, a practical system needs the bit-error ratio (BER) to be application-dependent which could be sub-optimal. This implies that it may not be necessary to have the minimal CF solution all the time. Rather it is desirable to search for a solution that meets the required sub-optimal BER. In this work, we propose a new detector design for a SISO/MIMO system by obtaining the relation between BER and CF which also improves the computational complexity of the ML detector for a sub-optimal BER.

In this paper, MA-MRC, a continual MRC model with uncertainty-aware fixed Memory and Adversarial domain adaptation, is proposed. In MA-MRC, a fixed size memory stores a small number of samples in previous domain data along with an uncertainty-aware updating strategy when new domain data arrives. For incremental learning, MA-MRC not only keeps a stable understanding by learning both memory and new domain data, but also makes full use of the domain adaptation relationship between them by adversarial learning strategy. The experimental results show that MA-MRC is superior to strong baselines and has a substantial incremental learning ability without catastrophically forgetting under two different continual MRC settings.

Deep convolution neural networks (CNN) showcase strong capacity in coping with the audio-visual saliency prediction task. Due to various factors such as shooting scenes and weather, there often exists moderate distribution discrepancy between source training data and target testing data. The domain discrepancy induces to performance degradation on target testing data for CNN models. This paper makes an early attempt to tackle the unsupervised domain adaptation problem for audio-visual saliency prediction. We propose a dual domain-adversarial learning algorithm to mitigate the domain discrepancy between source and target data. First, a specific domain discrimination branch is built up for aligning the auditory feature distributions. Then, those auditory features are fused into the visual features through a cross-modal self-attention module. The other domain discrimination branch is devised to reduce the domain discrepancy of visual features and audio-visual correlations implied by the fused audio-visual features. Experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that our method can relieve the performance degradation caused by domain discrepancy. ",

As a result, dealing with the words not occurring during training (a.k.a. out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words) have long been a fundamental challenge for NMT systems. The predominant method to tackle this problem is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) which splits words, including OOV words, into sub-word segments. BPE has achieved impressive results for a wide range of translation tasks in terms of automatic evaluation metrics. While it is often assumed that by using BPE, NMT systems are capable of handling OOV words, the effectiveness of BPE in translating OOV words has not been explicitly measured. In this paper, we study to what extent BPE is successful in translating OOV words at the word-level. We analyze the translation quality of OOV words based on word type, number of segments, cross-attention weights, and the frequency of segment n-grams in the training data. Our experiments show that while careful BPE settings seem to be fairly useful in translating OOV words across datasets, a considerable percentage of OOV words are translated incorrectly. Furthermore, we highlight the slightly higher effectiveness of BPE in translating OOV words for special cases, such as named-entities and when the languages involved are linguistically close to each other.

Relevant applications include error exponents in distributed hypothesis testing, rates of convergence of beliefs in social learning, and inaccuracy rates in distributed estimation. The bounds on the rate function have a very particular form at each node: they are constructed as the convex envelope between the rate function of the hypothetical fusion center and the rate function corresponding to a certain topological mode of the node's presence. We further show tightness of the discovered bounds for several cases, such as pendant nodes and regular networks, thus establishing the first proof of the large deviations principle for consensus+innovations and social learning in random networks.

Several recent works have proposed various regularization terms to address it i.e. by enforcing sparsity and smoothness constraints over the weakly-learned frame-level anomaly scores.

More specifically, for chordal graphs, we present an enumeration algorithm running in time $\\mathcal{O}(1.8940^n)$. For interval graphs, we can lower this time further to $\\mathcal{O}(1.7321^n)$. Interestingly, this also matches (exactly) the known lower bound.

    "abstract": "Improvements in the performance of computing systems, driven by Moore's Law, have transformed society. As such hardware-driven gains slow down, it becomes even more important for software developers to focus on performance and efficiency during development. While several studies have demonstrated the potential from such improved code efficiency (e.g., 2x better generational improvements compared to hardware), unlocking these gains in practice has been challenging. Reasoning about algorithmic complexity and the interaction of coding patterns on hardware can be challenging for the average programmer, especially when combined with pragmatic constraints around development velocity and multi-person development. This paper seeks to address this problem. We analyze a large competitive programming dataset from the Google Code Jam competition and find that efficient code is indeed rare, with a 2x runtime difference between the median and the 90th percentile of solutions. We propose using machine learning to automatically provide prescriptive feedback in the form of hints, to guide programmers towards writing high-performance code. To automatically learn these hints from the dataset, we propose a novel discrete variational auto-encoder, where each discrete latent variable represents a different learned category of code-edit that increases performance. We show that this method represents the multi-modal space of code efficiency edits better than a sequence-to-sequence baseline and generates a distribution of more efficient solutions. ",

In this paper, we set foundations for the study of NMT hallucinations. First, we work in a natural setting, i.e., in-domain data without artificial noise neither in training nor in inference. Next, we annotate a dataset of over 3.4k sentences indicating different kinds of critical errors and hallucinations. Then, we turn to detection methods and both revisit methods used previously and propose using glass-box uncertainty-based detectors. Overall, we show that for preventive settings, (i) previously used methods are largely inadequate, (ii) sequence log-probability works best and performs on par with reference-based methods. Finally, we propose DeHallucinator, a simple method for alleviating hallucinations at test time that significantly reduces the hallucinatory rate.

Resolving the FQNs of these non-FQN types and undeclared receiving objects (referred to as type inference) is the prerequisite to effective search and reuse of partial code. Existing dictionary-lookup based methods build a symbolic knowledge base of API names and code contexts, which involve significant compilation overhead and are sensitive to unseen API names and code context variations. In this paper, we formulate type inference as a cloze-style fill-in-blank language task. Built on source code naturalness, our approach fine-tunes a code masked language model (MLM) as a neural knowledge base of code elements with a novel \"pre-train, prompt and predict\" paradigm from raw source code. Our approach is lightweight and has minimum requirements on code compilation. Unlike existing symbolic name and context matching for type inference, our prompt-tuned code MLM packs FQN syntax and usage in its parameters and supports fuzzy neural type inference. We systematically evaluate our approach on a large amount of source code from GitHub and Stack Overflow. Our results confirm the effectiveness of our approach design and the practicality for partial code type inference.

So far, a growing number of methodologies have emerged for developing CNN models that are interpretable by design.

In this paper, we tackle these challenges with a novel, general framework for instantiating inherently interpretable CNN models, named E Pluribus Unum Interpretable CNN (EPU-CNN). An EPU-CNN model consists of CNN sub-networks, each of which receives a different representation of an input image expressing a perceptual feature, such as color or texture. The output of an EPU-CNN model consists of the classification prediction and its interpretation, in terms of relative contributions of perceptual features in different regions of the input image. EPU-CNN models have been extensively evaluated on various publicly available datasets, as well as a contributed benchmark dataset. Medical datasets are used to demonstrate the applicability of EPU-CNN for risk-sensitive decisions in medicine. The experimental results indicate that EPU-CNN models can achieve a comparable or better classification performance than other CNN architectures while providing humanly perceivable interpretations.

Most of recent approaches focus on 1) unimodal visual appearance or physiological (i.e., remote photoplethysmography (rPPG)) cues; and 2) separated feature representation for FAS or face forgery detection. On one side, unimodal appearance and rPPG features are respectively vulnerable to high-fidelity face 3D mask and video replay attacks, inspiring us to design reliable multi-modal fusion mechanisms for generalized face attack detection. On the other side, there are rich common features across FAS and face forgery detection tasks (e.g., periodic rPPG rhythms and vanilla appearance for bonafides), providing solid evidence to design a joint FAS and face forgery detection system in a multi-task learning fashion. In this paper, we establish the first joint face spoofing and forgery detection benchmark using both visual appearance and physiological rPPG cues. To enhance the rPPG periodicity discrimination, we design a two-branch physiological network using both facial spatio-temporal rPPG signal map and its continuous wavelet transformed counterpart as inputs. To mitigate the modality bias and improve the fusion efficacy, we conduct a weighted batch and layer normalization for both appearance and rPPG features before multi-modal fusion. We find that the generalization capacities of both unimodal (appearance or rPPG) and multi-modal (appearance+rPPG) models can be obviously improved via joint training on these two tasks. We hope this new benchmark will facilitate the future research of both FAS and deepfake detection communities. ",

    "abstract": "Blockchain systems based on a reusable resource, such as proof-of-stake (PoS), provide weaker security guarantees than those based on proof-of-work. Specifically, they are vulnerable to long-range attacks, where an adversary can corrupt prior participants in order to rewrite the full history of the chain. To prevent this attack on a PoS chain, we propose a protocol that checkpoints the state of the PoS chain to a proof-of-work blockchain such as Bitcoin. Our checkpointing protocol hence does not rely on any central authority. Our work uses Schnorr signatures and leverages Bitcoin recent Taproot upgrade, allowing us to create a checkpointing transaction of constant size. We argue for the security of our protocol and present an open-source implementation that was tested on the Bitcoin testnet. ",

Sememe knowledge bases (KBs), which contain words annotated with sememes, have been successfully applied to many NLP tasks, and we believe that by learning the smallest unit of meaning, computers can more easily understand human language. However, Existing sememe KBs are built on only manual annotation, human annotations have personal understanding biases, and the meaning of vocabulary will be constantly updated and changed with the times, and artificial methods are not always practical. To address the issue, we propose an unsupervised method based on a deep clustering network (DCN) to build a sememe KB, and you can use any language to build a KB through this method. We first learn the distributed representation of multilingual words, use MUSE to align them in a single vector space, learn the multi-layer meaning of each word through the self-attention mechanism, and use a DNC to cluster sememe features. Finally, we completed the prediction using only the 10-dimensional sememe space in English. We found that the low-dimensional space can still retain the main feature of the sememes. ",

In this paper, we propose a group-aware relational reasoning approach (named EvolveHypergraph) with explicit inference of the underlying dynamically evolving relational structures, and we demonstrate its effectiveness for multi-agent trajectory prediction. In addition to the edges between a pair of nodes (i.e., agents), we propose to infer hyperedges that adaptively connect multiple nodes to enable group-aware relational reasoning in an unsupervised manner without fixing the number of hyperedges. The proposed approach infers the dynamically evolving relation graphs and hypergraphs over time to capture the evolution of relations, which are used by the trajectory predictor to obtain future states. Moreover, we propose to regularize the smoothness of the relation evolution and the sparsity of the inferred graphs or hypergraphs, which effectively improves training stability and enhances the explainability of inferred relations. The proposed approach is validated on both synthetic crowd simulations and multiple real-world benchmark datasets. Our approach infers explainable, reasonable group-aware relations and achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-term prediction. ",

    "abstract": "The Rank Decoding problem (RD) is at the core of rank-based cryptography. This problem can also be seen as a structured version of MinRank, which is ubiquitous in multivariate cryptography. Recently, \\cite{BBBGNRT20,BBCGPSTV20} proposed attacks based on two new algebraic modelings, namely the MaxMinors modeling which is specific to RD and the Support-Minors modeling which applies to MinRank in general. Both improved significantly the complexity of algebraic attacks on these two problems. In the case of RD and contrarily to what was believed up to now, these new attacks were shown to be able to outperform combinatorial attacks and this even for very small field sizes. However, we prove here that the analysis performed in \\cite{BBCGPSTV20} for one of these attacks which consists in mixing the MaxMinors modeling with the Support-Minors modeling to solve RD is too optimistic and leads to underestimate the overall complexity. This is done by exhibiting linear dependencies between these equations and by considering an $\\fqm$ version of these modelings which turns out to be instrumental for getting a better understanding of both systems. Moreover, by working over $\\Fqm$ rather than over $\\ff{q}$, we are able to drastically reduce the number of variables in the system and we (i) still keep enough algebraic equations to be able to solve the system, (ii) are able to analyze rigorously the complexity of our approach. This new approach may improve the older MaxMinors approach on RD from \\cite{BBBGNRT20,BBCGPSTV20} for certain parameters. We also introduce a new hybrid approach on the Support-Minors system whose impact is much more general since it applies to any MinRank problem. This technique improves significantly the complexity of the Support-Minors approach for small to moderate field sizes. ",

By introducing a Sobel fusion module between the two segmentation branches, the spatial information of LA boundaries can be propagated from the LA branch to the scar branch. Thus, LA scar segmentation can be performed condition on the LA boundaries regions.

Here, we propose a novel graph multi task deep learning model to identify compounds carrying both target inhibitory and cell active (MATIC) properties. On a carefully curated SARS-CoV-2 dataset, the proposed MATIC model shows advantages comparing with traditional method in screening effective compounds in vivo. Next, we explored the model interpretability and found that the learned features for target inhibition (in vitro) or cell active (in vivo) tasks are different with molecular property correlations and atom functional attentions. Based on these findings, we utilized a monte carlo based reinforcement learning generative model to generate novel multi-property compounds with both in vitro and in vivo efficacy, thus bridging the gap between target-based and cell-based drug discovery.

Machine learning has the potential to provide a complexity-friendly LB solution with near-optimal network performance, at the cost of a training process. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) learning-aided LB methods, however, need retraining when the network environment (especially the number of users) changes, significantly limiting its practicability. In this paper, a novel deep neural network (DNN) structure named adaptive target-condition neural network (A-TCNN) is proposed, which conducts AP selection for one target user upon the condition of other users. Also, an adaptive mechanism is developed to map a smaller number of users to a larger number through splitting their data rate requirements, without affecting the AP selection result for the target user. This enables the proposed method to handle different numbers of users without the need for retraining. Results show that A-TCNN achieves a network throughput very close to that of the testing dataset, with a gap less than 3%. It is also proven that A-TCNN can obtain a network throughput comparable to two SOTA benchmarks, while reducing the runtime by up to three orders of magnitude. ",

One of the most successful methods is contrastive self-supervised methods, which require negative sampling: sampling alternative samples to contrast with the current sample (anchor). However, it is hard to ensure if all the negative samples belong to classes different from the anchor class without labels. This paper applies a non-contrastive self-supervised learning method on an unlabeled speech corpus to learn utterance-level embeddings. We used DIstillation with NO labels (DINO), proposed in computer vision, and adapted it to the speech domain. Unlike the contrastive methods, DINO does not require negative sampling. These embeddings were evaluated on speaker verification and emotion recognition. In speaker verification, the unsupervised DINO embedding with cosine scoring provided 4.38% EER on the VoxCeleb1 test trial. This outperforms the best contrastive self-supervised method by 40% relative in EER. An iterative pseudo-labeling training pipeline, not requiring speaker labels, further improved the EER to 1.89%. In emotion recognition, the DINO embedding performed 60.87, 79.21, and 56.98% in micro-f1 score on IEMOCAP, Crema-D, and MSP-Podcast, respectively.

Clinical reports indicated that COVID-19 infection may cause cardiac injury, and electrocardiograms (ECG) may serve as a diagnostic biomarker for COVID-19. This study aims to utilize ECG signals to detect COVID-19 automatically. We propose a novel method to extract ECG signals from ECG paper records, which are then fed into a one-dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN) to learn and diagnose the disease. To evaluate the quality of digitized signals, R peaks in the paper-based ECG images are labeled. Afterward, RR intervals calculated from each image are compared to RR intervals of the corresponding digitized signal. Experiments on the COVID-19 ECG images dataset demonstrate that the proposed digitization method is able to capture correctly the original signals, with a mean absolute error of 28.11 ms. Our proposed 1D-CNN model, which is trained on the digitized ECG signals, allows identifying individuals with COVID-19 and other subjects accurately, with classification accuracies of 98.42%, 95.63%, and 98.50% for classifying COVID-19 vs. Normal, COVID-19 vs. Abnormal Heartbeats, and COVID-19 vs. other classes, respectively. Furthermore, the proposed method also achieves a high-level of performance for the multi-classification task. Our findings indicate that a deep learning system trained on digitized ECG signals can serve as a potential tool for diagnosing COVID-19. ",

One of the most successful is a contrastive method, which requires negative sampling: selecting alternative samples to contrast with the current sample (anchor). However, this does not ensure that all the negative samples belong to classes different from the anchor class without labels. This paper applies a non-contrastive self-supervised method to learn utterance-level embeddings. We adapted DIstillation with NO labels (DINO) from computer vision to speech. Unlike contrastive methods, DINO does not require negative sampling. We compared DINO to x-vector trained in a supervised manner. When transferred to down-stream tasks (speaker verification, speech emotion recognition (SER), and Alzheimer's disease detection), DINO outperformed x-vector. We studied the influence of several aspects during transfer learning such as dividing the fine-tuning process into steps, chunk lengths, or augmentation. During fine-tuning, tuning the last affine layers first and then the whole network surpassed fine-tuning all at once. Using shorter chunk lengths, although they generate more diverse inputs, did not necessarily improve performance, implying speech segments at least with a specific length are required for better performance per application. Augmentation was helpful in SER. ",

    "abstract": "We propose statistically robust and computationally efficient linear learning methods in the high-dimensional batch setting, where the number of features $d$ may exceed the sample size $n$. We employ, in a generic learning setting, two algorithms depending on whether the considered loss function is gradient-Lipschitz or not. Then, we instantiate our framework on several applications including vanilla sparse, group-sparse and low-rank matrix recovery. This leads, for each application, to efficient and robust learning algorithms, that reach near-optimal estimation rates under heavy-tailed distributions and the presence of outliers. For vanilla $s$-sparsity, we are able to reach the $s\\log (d)/n$ rate under heavy-tails and $\\eta$-corruption, at a computational cost comparable to that of non-robust analogs. We provide an efficient implementation of our algorithms in an open-source $\\mathtt{Python}$ library called $\\mathtt{linlearn}$, by means of which we carry out numerical experiments which confirm our theoretical findings together with a comparison to other recent approaches proposed in the literature.
