    "abstract": "Malicious software (malware) causes much harm to our devices and life. We are eager to understand the malware behavior and the threat it made. Most of the record files of malware are variable length and text-based files with time stamps, such as event log data and dynamic analysis profiles. Using the time stamps, we can sort such data into sequence-based data for the following analysis. However, dealing with the text-based sequences with variable lengths is difficult. In addition, unlike natural language text data, most sequential data in information security have specific properties and structure, such as loop, repeated call, noise, etc. To deeply analyze the API call sequences with their structure, we use graphs to represent the sequences, which can further investigate the information and structure, such as the Markov model. Therefore, we design and implement an Attention Aware Graph Neural Network (AWGCN) to analyze the API call sequences. Through AWGCN, we can obtain the sequence embeddings to analyze the behavior of the malware. Moreover, the classification experiment result shows that AWGCN outperforms other classifiers in the call-like datasets, and the embedding can further improve the classic model's performance. ",

With our analysis, most of the existing DNN watermarking methods can resist fine-tuning and pruning attack, but distillation attack. To address these problem, we propose a new DNN watermarking framework, Unified Soft-label Perturbation (USP), having a detector paired with the model to be watermarked, and Customized Soft-label Perturbation (CSP), embedding watermark via adding perturbation into the model output probability distribution. Experimental results show that our methods can resist all watermark removal attacks and outperform in distillation attack.

    "abstract": "Graph edge perturbations are dedicated to damaging the prediction of graph neural networks by modifying the graph structure. Previous gray-box attackers employ gradients from the surrogate model to locate the vulnerable edges to perturb the graph structure. However, unreliability exists in gradients on graph structures, which is rarely studied by previous works. In this paper, we discuss and analyze the errors caused by the unreliability of the structural gradients. These errors arise from rough gradient usage due to the discreteness of the graph structure and from the unreliability in the meta-gradient on the graph structure. In order to address these problems, we propose a novel attack model with methods to reduce the errors inside the structural gradients. We propose edge discrete sampling to select the edge perturbations associated with hierarchical candidate selection to ensure computational efficiency. In addition, semantic invariance and momentum gradient ensemble are proposed to address the gradient fluctuation on semantic-augmented graphs and the instability of the surrogate model. Experiments are conducted in untargeted gray-box poisoning scenarios and demonstrate the improvement in the performance of our approach. ",

    "abstract": "Web-crawled datasets have enabled remarkable generalization capabilities in recent image-text models such as CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image pre-training) or Flamingo, but little is known about the dataset creation processes. In this work, we introduce a testbed of six publicly available data sources - YFCC, LAION, Conceptual Captions, WIT, RedCaps, Shutterstock - to investigate how pre-training distributions induce robustness in CLIP. We find that the performance of the pre-training data varies substantially across distribution shifts, with no single data source dominating. Moreover, we systematically study the interactions between these data sources and find that combining multiple sources does not necessarily yield better models, but rather dilutes the robustness of the best individual data source. We complement our empirical findings with theoretical insights from a simple setting, where combining the training data also results in diluted robustness. In addition, our theoretical model provides a candidate explanation for the success of the CLIP-based data filtering technique recently employed in the LAION dataset. Overall our results demonstrate that simply gathering a large amount of data from the web is not the most effective way to build a pre-training dataset for robust generalization, necessitating further study into dataset design.

    "abstract": "Developing safety and efficiency applications for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) require a great deal of testing and evaluation. The need for the operation of these systems in critical and dangerous situations makes the burden of their evaluation very costly, possibly dangerous, and time-consuming. As an alternative, researchers attempt to study and evaluate their algorithms and designs using simulation platforms. Modeling the behavior of drivers or human operators in CAVs or other vehicles interacting with them is one of the main challenges of such simulations. While developing a perfect model for human behavior is a challenging task and an open problem, we present a significant augmentation of the current models used in simulators for driver behavior. In this paper, we present a simulation platform for a hybrid transportation system that includes both human-driven and automated vehicles. In addition, we decompose the human driving task and offer a modular approach to simulating a large-scale traffic scenario, allowing for a thorough investigation of automated and active safety systems. Such representation through Interconnected modules offers a human-interpretable system that can be tuned to represent different classes of drivers. Additionally, we analyze a large driving dataset to extract expressive parameters that would best describe different driving characteristics. Finally, we recreate a similarly dense traffic scenario within our simulator and conduct a thorough analysis of various human-specific and system-specific factors, studying their effect on traffic network performance and safety.

    "abstract": "Clustering analysis is one of the critical tasks in machine learning. Traditionally, clustering has been an independent task, separate from outlier detection. Due to the fact that the performance of clustering can be significantly eroded by outliers, a small number of algorithms try to incorporate outlier detection in the process of clustering. However, most of those algorithms are based on unsupervised partition-based algorithms such as k-means. Given the nature of those algorithms, they often fail to deal with clusters of complex, non-convex shapes. To tackle this challenge, we have proposed SSDBCODI, a semi-supervised density-based algorithm. SSDBCODI combines the advantage of density-based algorithms, which are capable of dealing with clusters of complex shapes, with the semi-supervised element, which offers flexibility to adjust the clustering results based on a few user labels. We also merge an outlier detection component with the clustering process. Potential outliers are detected based on three scores generated during the process: (1) reachability-score, which measures how density-reachable a point is to a labeled normal object, (2) local-density-score, which measures the neighboring density of data objects, and (3) similarity-score, which measures the closeness of a point to its nearest labeled outliers. Then in the following step, instance weights are generated for each data instance based on those three scores before being used to train a classifier for further clustering and outlier detection. To enhance the understanding of the proposed algorithm, for our evaluation, we have run our proposed algorithm against some of the state-of-art approaches on multiple datasets and separately listed the results of outlier detection apart from clustering. Our results indicate that our algorithm can achieve superior results with a small percentage of labels. ",

To accommodate higher-order connections between nodes, Estrada and Ross extended graph-based centrality measures to simplicial complexes by expanding node centrality to simplices. We follow this extension but digress in the approach in that we propose novel centrality measures by considering algebraically-computable topological signatures of cycles and their homological persistence. We apply tools from algebraic topology to extract multi-scale signatures within cycle spaces of weighted graphs by tracking homology generators that persist across a weight-induced filtration of simplicial complexes built over graphs. We take these persistent signatures, as well as the merge information of homology classes along the filtration to design centrality measures that quantify cycle importance not only via its geometric and topological significance, but also by its homological influence on other cycles. We also show that these measures are stable under small perturbations allowed by an appropriate metric. ",

    "abstract": "Human ecological success relies on our characteristic ability to flexibly self-organize in cooperative social groups. Successful groups employ substantial specialization and division of labor. Unlike most other animals, humans learn by trial and error during their lives what role to take on. However, when some critical roles are more attractive than others, and individuals are self-interested, then there is a social dilemma: each individual would prefer others take on the critical-but-unremunerative roles so they may remain free to take one that pays better. But disaster occurs if all act thusly and a critical role goes unfilled. In such situations learning an optimum role distribution may not be possible. Consequently, a fundamental question is: how can division of labor emerge in groups of self-interested lifetime-learning individuals? Here we show that by introducing a model of social norms, which we regard as patterns of decentralized social sanctioning, it becomes possible for groups of self-interested individuals to learn a productive division of labor involving all critical roles. Such social norms work by redistributing rewards within the population to disincentivize antisocial roles while incentivizing prosocial roles that do not intrinsically pay as well as others. ",

Recent studies have shown that directly applying general purpose emotion classification tools to SE corpora is not effective. Even within the SE domain, tool performance degrades significantly when trained on one communication channel and evaluated on another (e.g, StackOverflow vs. GitHub comments). Retraining a tool with channel-specific data takes significant effort since manually annotating large datasets of ground truth data is expensive. In this paper, we address this data scarcity problem by automatically creating new training data using a data augmentation technique. Based on an analysis of the types of errors made by popular SE-specific emotion recognition tools, we specifically target our data augmentation strategy in order to improve the performance of emotion recognition. Our results show an average improvement of 9.3% in micro F1-Score for three existing emotion classification tools (ESEM-E, EMTk, SEntiMoji) when trained with our best augmentation strategy. ",

Although these frameworks are extremely capable when it comes to modeling complex phenomena, they require an extensive amount of data for successful training which is often not available or is too expensive. However, this issue can be alleviated with the use of multi-fidelity learning, where a model is trained by making use of a large amount of inexpensive low-fidelity data along with a small amount of expensive high-fidelity data. To this end, we develop a new framework based on the wavelet neural operator which is capable of learning from a multi-fidelity dataset. The developed model's excellent learning capabilities are demonstrated by solving different problems which require effective correlation learning between the two fidelities for surrogate construction. Furthermore, we also assess the application of the developed framework for uncertainty quantification. The results obtained from this work illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed framework. ",

Inspired by that different models memorize different knowledge when learning novel concepts, we propose a Memorizing Complementation Network (MCNet) to ensemble multiple models that complements the different memorized knowledge with each other in novel tasks. Additionally, to update the model with few novel samples, we develop a Prototype Smoothing Hard-mining Triplet (PSHT) loss to push the novel samples away from not only each other in current task but also the old distribution.

The previous two-stage approach first extracts segmentation region proposals by an off-the-shelf panoptic segmentation model, then conducts coarse region-phrase matching to ground the candidate regions for each noun phrase. However, the two-stage pipeline usually suffers from the performance limitation of low-quality proposals in the first stage and the loss of spatial details caused by region feature pooling, as well as complicated strategies designed for things and stuff categories separately. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose a one-stage end-to-end Pixel-Phrase Matching Network (PPMN), which directly matches each phrase to its corresponding pixels instead of region proposals and outputs panoptic segmentation by simple combination. Thus, our model can exploit sufficient and finer cross-modal semantic correspondence from the supervision of densely annotated pixel-phrase pairs rather than sparse region-phrase pairs. In addition, we also propose a Language-Compatible Pixel Aggregation (LCPA) module to further enhance the discriminative ability of phrase features through multi-round refinement, which selects the most compatible pixels for each phrase to adaptively aggregate the corresponding visual context.

When applying such a type of network on the graph without node features, one can extract simple graph-based node features (e.g., number of degrees) or learn the input node representations (i.e., embeddings) when training the network. While the latter approach, which trains node embeddings, more likely leads to better performance, the number of parameters associated with the embeddings grows linearly with the number of nodes. It is therefore impractical to train the input node embeddings together with GNNs within graphics processing unit (GPU) memory in an end-to-end fashion when dealing with industrial-scale graph data. Inspired by the embedding compression methods developed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, we develop a node embedding compression method where each node is compactly represented with a bit vector instead of a floating-point vector. The parameters utilized in the compression method can be trained together with GNNs. We show that the proposed node embedding compression method achieves superior performance compared to the alternatives. ",

To solve this problem, we propose Attentive-Diversity Attack (ADA), which disrupts diverse salient features in a stochastic manner to improve transferability. Primarily, we perturb the image attention to disrupt universal features shared by different models. Then, to effectively avoid poor local optima, we disrupt these features in a stochastic manner and explore the search space of transferable perturbations more exhaustively. More specifically, we use a generator to produce adversarial perturbations that each disturbs features in different ways depending on an input latent code.

    "abstract": "Edge-enabled Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) introduces real-time services and storage, computation, and communication facilities to the vehicles through Roadside Units (RSUs). Nevertheless, RSUs are often easy targets for security assaults due to their placement in an open, unprotected environment and resource-constrained nature. The malicious RSUs compromised by security attacks impose threats to human safety by impeding the operations of VANETs. Hence, an effective malevolent RSU detection mechanism is crucial for VANETs. Existing trust-based detection mechanisms assign trust scores to RSUs based on their interactions with moving vehicles where precise detection of rogue RSUs depends on the accuracy of trust scores. However, brief interaction of RSUs with the running vehicles permits inadequate time to estimate trust accurately. Besides, current works use only vehicle speed and density in beacon messages to assess trust without considering the sensor-detected data in the same messages. Nonetheless, sensor data is useful for traffic management, and neglecting them creates inaccuracy in trust estimation. In this paper, we address these limitations and propose a trust-based scheme to detect malicious RSUs that uses stable and frequent RSU-to-RSU (R2R) interaction to precisely analyze the behavior of an RSU. We also offer a mechanism to detect alteration of sensor-detected data in beacon content and incorporate this scheme in the trust calculation of RSUs. The experimental results show that the proposed solution effectively detects approximately 92% malicious RSUs, even in the presence of hostile vehicles. Moreover, integrating the proposed solution with the VANET routing protocols improves routing efficiency. ",

    "abstract": "The cold-start problem is a long-standing challenge in recommender systems due to the lack of user-item interactions, which significantly hurts the recommendation effect over new users and items. Recently, meta-learning based methods attempt to learn globally shared prior knowledge across all users, which can be rapidly adapted to new users and items with very few interactions. Though with significant performance improvement, the globally shared parameter may lead to local optimum. Besides, they are oblivious to the inherent information and feature interactions existing in the new users and items, which are critical in cold-start scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Task aligned Meta-learning based Augmented Graph (TMAG) to address cold-start recommendation. Specifically, a fine-grained task aligned constructor is proposed to cluster similar users and divide tasks for meta-learning, enabling consistent optimization direction. Besides, an augmented graph neural network with two graph enhanced approaches is designed to alleviate data sparsity and capture the high-order user-item interactions. We validate our approach on three real-world datasets in various cold-start scenarios, showing the superiority of TMAG over state-of-the-art methods for cold-start recommendation. ",

    "abstract": "As one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world, Taobao's recommendation systems (RSs) serve the demands of shopping for hundreds of millions of customers. Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a core component of the RS. One of the biggest characteristics in CTR prediction at Taobao is that there exist multiple recommendation domains where the scales of different domains vary significantly. Therefore, it is crucial to perform cross-domain CTR prediction to transfer knowledge from large domains to small domains to alleviate the data sparsity issue. However, existing cross-domain CTR prediction methods are proposed for static knowledge transfer, ignoring that all domains in real-world RSs are continually time-evolving. In light of this, we present a necessary but novel task named Continual Transfer Learning (CTL), which transfers knowledge from a time-evolving source domain to a time-evolving target domain. In this work, we propose a simple and effective CTL model called CTNet to solve the problem of continual cross-domain CTR prediction at Taobao, and CTNet can be trained efficiently. Particularly, CTNet considers an important characteristic in the industry that models has been continually well-trained for a very long time. So CTNet aims to fully utilize all the well-trained model parameters in both source domain and target domain to avoid losing historically acquired knowledge, and only needs incremental target domain data for training to guarantee efficiency. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing at Taobao demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of CTNet. CTNet is now deployed online in the recommender systems of Taobao, serving the main traffic of hundreds of millions of active users. ",

However, existing works cannot handle the general form of cutting plane constraints widely accepted in traditional solvers, which are crucial for strengthening verifiers with tightened convex relaxations. In this paper, we generalize the bound propagation procedure to allow the addition of arbitrary cutting plane constraints, including those involving relaxed integer variables that do not appear in existing bound propagation formulations. Our generalized bound propagation method, GCP-CROWN, opens up the opportunity to apply general cutting plane methods} for neural network verification while benefiting from the efficiency and GPU acceleration of bound propagation methods. As a case study, we investigate the use of cutting planes generated by off-the-shelf mixed integer programming (MIP) solver. We find that MIP solvers can generate high-quality cutting planes for strengthening bound-propagation-based verifiers using our new formulation. Since the branching-focused bound propagation procedure and the cutting-plane-focused MIP solver can run in parallel utilizing different types of hardware (GPUs and CPUs), their combination can quickly explore a large number of branches with strong cutting planes, leading to strong verification performance. Experiments demonstrate that our method is the first verifier that can completely solve the oval20 benchmark and verify twice as many instances on the oval21 benchmark compared to the best tool in VNN-COMP 2021, and also noticeably outperforms state-of-the-art verifiers on a wide range of benchmarks.

We demonstrate that such momentum can also be plugged into momentum-free SSL frameworks, such as SimCLR, for a performance boost. Despite its wide use as a fundamental component in modern SSL frameworks, the benefit caused by momentum is not well understood. We find that its success can be at least partly attributed to the stability effect. In the first attempt, we analyze how EMA affects each part of the encoder and reveal that the portion near the encoder's input plays an insignificant role while the latter parts have much more influence. By monitoring the gradient of the overall loss with respect to the output of each block in the encoder, we observe that the final layers tend to fluctuate much more than other layers during backpropagation, i.e. less stability. Interestingly, we show that using EMA to the final part of the SSL encoder, i.e. projector, instead of the whole deep network encoder can give comparable or preferable performance. Our proposed projector-only momentum helps maintain the benefit of EMA but avoids the double forward computation. ",

    "abstract": "The core of many cryptocurrencies is the decentralised validation network operating on proof-of-work technology. In these systems, validation is done by so-called miners who can digitally sign blocks once they solve a computationally-hard problem. Conventional wisdom generally considers this protocol as secure and stable as miners are incentivised to follow the behaviour of the majority. However, whether some strategic mining behaviours occur in practice is still a major concern. In this paper we target this question by focusing on a security threat: a selfish mining attack in which malicious miners deviate from protocol by not immediately revealing their newly mined blocks. We propose a statistical test to analyse each miner's behaviour in five popular cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monacoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash. Our method is based on the realisation that selfish mining behaviour will cause identifiable anomalies in the statistics of miner's successive blocks discovery. Secondly, we apply heuristics-based address clustering to improve the detectability of this kind of behaviour. We find a marked presence of abnormal miners in Monacoin and Bitcoin Cash, and, to a lesser extent, in Ethereum. Finally, we extend our method to detect coordinated selfish mining attacks, finding mining cartels in Monacoin where miners might secretly share information about newly mined blocks in advance. Our analysis contributes to the research on security in cryptocurrency systems by providing the first empirical evidence that the aforementioned strategic mining behaviours do take place in practice.

Unlike existing dynamic NeRFs that require dense images as input and can only be modeled for a single identity, our method enables face reconstruction across different persons with few-shot inputs. Compared to state-of-the-art few-shot NeRFs designed for modeling static scenes, the proposed FDNeRF accepts view-inconsistent dynamic inputs and supports arbitrary facial expression editing, i.e., producing faces with novel expressions beyond the input ones. To handle the inconsistencies between dynamic inputs, we introduce a well-designed conditional feature warping (CFW) module to perform expression conditioned warping in 2D feature space, which is also identity adaptive and 3D constrained. As a result, features of different expressions are transformed into the target ones. We then construct a radiance field based on these view-consistent features and use volumetric rendering to synthesize novel views of the modeled faces. Extensive experiments with quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrate that our method outperforms existing dynamic and few-shot NeRFs on both 3D face reconstruction and expression editing tasks. Our code and model will be available upon acceptance. ",

A mode is an independent component of the system with its own objectives, monitoring data, and algorithms. The behaviour of a mode, including its transitions to other modes, is determined by belief functions that interpret the mode's monitoring data in the light of its objectives and algorithms.

    "abstract": "This paper concerns the central issues of model robustness and sample efficiency in offline reinforcement learning (RL), which aims to learn to perform decision making from history data without active exploration. Due to uncertainties and variabilities of the environment, it is critical to learn a robust policy -- with as few samples as possible -- that performs well even when the deployed environment deviates from the nominal one used to collect the history dataset. We consider a distributionally robust formulation of offline RL, focusing on a tabular non-stationary finite-horizon robust Markov decision process with an uncertainty set specified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To combat with sample scarcity, a model-based algorithm that combines distributionally robust value iteration with the principle of pessimism in the face of uncertainty is proposed, by penalizing the robust value estimates with a carefully designed data-driven penalty term. Under a mild and tailored assumption of the history dataset that measures distribution shift without requiring full coverage of the state-action space, we establish the finite-sample complexity of the proposed algorithm, and further show it is almost unimprovable in light of a nearly-matching information-theoretic lower bound up to a polynomial factor of the horizon length. To the best our knowledge, this provides the first provably near-optimal robust offline RL algorithm that learns under model uncertainty and partial coverage. ",

To address this concern, we propose a completely unsupervised MAD solution via self-paced anomaly detection (SPL-MAD) by leveraging the existing large-scale face recognition (FR) datasets and the unsupervised nature of convolutional autoencoders. Using general FR datasets that might contain unintentionally and unlabeled manipulated samples to train an autoencoder can lead to a diverse reconstruction behavior of attack and bona fide samples. We analyze this behavior empirically to provide a solid theoretical ground for designing our unsupervised MAD solution. This also results in proposing to integrate our adapted modified self-paced learning paradigm to enhance the reconstruction error separability between the bona fide and attack samples in a completely unsupervised manner. Our experimental results on a diverse set of MAD evaluation datasets show that the proposed unsupervised SPL-MAD solution outperforms the overall performance of a wide range of supervised MAD solutions and provides higher generalizability on unknown attacks.

    "abstract": "Practical image segmentation tasks concern images which must be reconstructed from noisy, distorted, and/or incomplete observations. A recent approach for solving such tasks is to perform this reconstruction jointly with the segmentation, using each to guide the other. However, this work has so far employed relatively simple segmentation methods, such as the Chan--Vese algorithm. In this paper, we present a method for joint reconstruction-segmentation using graph-based segmentation methods, which have been seeing increasing recent interest. Complications arise due to the large size of the matrices involved, and we show how these complications can be managed. We then analyse the convergence properties of our scheme. Finally, we apply this scheme to distorted versions of ``two cows'' images familiar from previous graph-based segmentation literature, first to a highly noised version and second to a blurred version, achieving highly accurate segmentations in both cases. We compare these results to those obtained by sequential reconstruction-segmentation approaches, finding that our method competes with, or even outperforms, those approaches in terms of reconstruction and segmentation accuracy.

    "abstract": "Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool that provides an accurate and resolution-independent encoding of data. Their robustness as general approximators has been shown in a wide variety of data sources, with applications on image, sound, and 3D scene representation. However, little attention has been given to leveraging these architectures for the representation and analysis of time series data. In this paper, we analyze the representation of time series using INRs, comparing different activation functions in terms of reconstruction accuracy and training convergence speed. We show how these networks can be leveraged for the imputation of time series, with applications on both univariate and multivariate data. Finally, we propose a hypernetwork architecture that leverages INRs to learn a compressed latent representation of an entire time series dataset. We introduce an FFT-based loss to guide training so that all frequencies are preserved in the time series. We show that this network can be used to encode time series as INRs, and their embeddings can be interpolated to generate new time series from existing ones. We evaluate our generative method by using it for data augmentation, and show that it is competitive against current state-of-the-art approaches for augmentation of time series. ",

SCD is challenging due to noisy changes in illumination, seasonal variations, and perspective differences across a pair of views. Deep neural network based solutions require a large quantity of annotated data which is tedious and expensive to obtain. On the other hand, transfer learning from large datasets induces domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a novel \\textit{Differencing self-supervised pretraining (DSP)} method that uses feature differencing to learn discriminatory representations corresponding to the changed regions while simultaneously tackling the noisy changes by enforcing temporal invariance across views. Our experimental results on SCD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, specifically to differences in camera viewpoints and lighting conditions. Compared against the self-supervised Barlow Twins and the standard ImageNet pretraining that uses more than a million additional labeled images, DSP can surpass it without using any additional data. Our results also demonstrate the robustness of DSP to natural corruptions, distribution shift, and learning under limited labeled data. ",

Therefore, many detection models and databases have been proposed to detect DeepFake data reliably. However, there is an increased concern that these models and training databases might be biased and thus, cause DeepFake detectors to fail. In this work, we tackle these issues by (a) providing large-scale demographic and non-demographic attribute annotations of 41 different attributes for five popular DeepFake datasets and (b) comprehensively analysing AI-bias of multiple state-of-the-art DeepFake detection models on these databases. The investigation analyses the influence of a large variety of distinctive attributes (from over 65M labels) on the detection performance, including demographic (age, gender, ethnicity) and non-demographic (hair, skin, accessories, etc.) information. The results indicate that investigated databases lack diversity and, more importantly, show that the utilised DeepFake detection models are strongly biased towards many investigated attributes. Moreover, the results show that the models' decision-making might be based on several questionable (biased) assumptions, such if a person is smiling or wearing a hat. Depending on the application of such DeepFake detection methods, these biases can lead to generalizability, fairness, and security issues. We hope that the findings of this study and the annotation databases will help to evaluate and mitigate bias in future DeepFake detection techniques. Our annotation datasets are made publicly available. ",

While deep learning methods have proven to be effective in molecular property prediction, we design a novel method, namely GEM-2, which comprehensively considers both the long-range and many-body interactions in molecules. GEM-2 consists of two interacted tracks: an atom-level track modeling both the local and global correlation between any two atoms, and a pair-level track modeling the correlation between all atom pairs, which embed information between any 3 or 4 atoms. Extensive experiments demonstrated the superiority of GEM-2 over multiple baseline methods in quantum chemistry and drug discovery tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Morphing attacks are a form of presentation attacks that gathered increasing attention in recent years. A morphed image can be successfully verified to multiple identities. This operation, therefore, poses serious security issues related to the ability of a travel or identity document to be verified to belong to multiple persons. Previous works touched on the issue of the quality of morphing attack images, however, with the main goal of quantitatively proofing the realistic appearance of the produced morphing attacks. We theorize that the morphing processes might have an effect on both, the perceptual image quality and the image utility in face recognition (FR) when compared to bona fide samples. Towards investigating this theory, this work provides an extensive analysis of the effect of morphing on face image quality, including both general image quality measures and face image utility measures. This analysis is not limited to a single morphing technique, but rather looks at six different morphing techniques and five different data sources using ten different quality measures. This analysis reveals consistent separability between the quality scores of morphing attack and bona fide samples measured by certain quality measures. Our study goes further to build on this effect and investigate the possibility of performing unsupervised morphing attack detection (MAD) based on quality scores. Our study looks intointra and inter-dataset detectability to evaluate the generalizability of such a detection concept on different morphing techniques and bona fide sources. Our final results point out that a set of quality measures, such as MagFace and CNNNIQA, can be used to perform unsupervised and generalized MAD with a correct classification accuracy of over 70%. ",

These results are useful in the analysis and design of finite element methods, namely for devising stable local commuting projectors and establishing local-best/global-best equivalences in a priori analysis and in the context of a posteriori error estimation. Unconstrained minimization in H1 and constrained minimization in H(div) have been previously treated in the literature. Along with improvement of the results in the H1 and H(div) cases, our key contribution is the treatment of the H(curl) framework.

Specifically, in FL, models are trained on the users devices and only model updates (i.e., gradients) are sent to a central server for aggregation purposes. However, the long list of inference attacks that leak private data from gradients, published in the recent years, have emphasized the need of devising effective protection mechanisms to incentivize the adoption of FL at scale. While there exist solutions to mitigate these attacks on the server side, little has been done to protect users from attacks performed on the client side. In this context, the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) on the client side are among the most proposing solutions. However, existing frameworks (e.g., DarkneTZ) require statically putting a large portion of the machine learning model into the TEE to effectively protect against complex attacks or a combination of attacks. We present GradSec, a solution that allows protecting in a TEE only sensitive layers of a machine learning model, either statically or dynamically, hence reducing both the TCB size and the overall training time by up to 30% and 56%, respectively compared to state-of-the-art competitors.

Recently, spatial-temporal deep learning models demonstrate the tremendous potential to enhance prediction accuracy. However, few studies tackled the uncertainty and sparsity issues in fine-grained O-D matrices. This presents a serious problem, because a vast number of zeros deviate from the Gaussian assumption underlying the deterministic deep learning models. To address this issue, we design a Spatial-Temporal Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Graph Neural Network (STZINB-GNN) to quantify the uncertainty of the sparse travel demand. It analyzes spatial and temporal correlations using diffusion and temporal convolution networks, which are then fused to parameterize the probabilistic distributions of travel demand. The STZINB-GNN is examined using two real-world datasets with various spatial and temporal resolutions. The results demonstrate the superiority of STZINB-GNN over benchmark models, especially under high spatial-temporal resolutions, because of its high accuracy, tight confidence intervals, and interpretable parameters. The sparsity parameter of the STZINB-GNN has physical interpretation for various transportation applications. ",

We study the problem of safety-critical control of a LiDAR-based system under sensor faults and attacks. We propose a framework consisting of fault tolerant estimation and fault tolerant control. The former reconstructs a LiDAR scan with state estimations, and excludes the possible faulty estimations that are not aligned with LiDAR measurements. We also verify the correctness of LiDAR scans by comparing them with the reconstructed ones and removing the possibly compromised sector in the scan. Fault tolerant control computes a control signal with the remaining estimations at each time step. We prove that the synthesized control input guarantees system safety using control barrier certificates. We validate our proposed framework using a UAV delivery system in an urban environment. We show that our proposed approach guarantees safety for the UAV whereas a baseline fails. ",

However, the code produced does not have any correctness guarantees around satisfying user's intent. In fact, it is hard to define a notion of correctness since natural language can be ambiguous and lacks a formal semantics. In this paper, we take a first step towards addressing the problem above by proposing the workflow of test-driven user-intent formalization (TDUIF), which leverages lightweight user feedback to jointly (a) formalize the user intent as tests (a partial specification), and (b) generates code that meets the formal user intent. To perform a scalable and large-scale automated evaluation of the algorithms without requiring a user in the loop, we describe how to simulate user interaction with high-fidelity using a reference solution. We also describe and implement alternate implementations of several algorithmic components (including mutating and ranking a set of tests) that can be composed for efficient solutions to the TDUIF problem. We have developed a system TICODER that implements several solutions to TDUIF, and compare their relative effectiveness on the MBPP academic code generation benchmark. Our results are promising with using the OpenAI Codex LLM on MBPP: our best algorithm improves the pass@1 code generation accuracy metric from 48.39% to 70.49% with a single user query, and up to 85.48% with up to 5 user queries.

Such a moving boundary is often simulated by a phase-filed model. We first apply the matched asymptotic analysis to give a rigorous derivation of the sharp-interface model of the cell boundary from a phase-field model. We then develop a robust numerical approach that combines the level-set method to track the sharp boundary of a moving cell and accurate discretization techniques for solving the reaction-diffusion equations on the moving cell region. Our extensive numerical simulations predict the cell polarization under various kinds of stimulus, and capture both the linear and circular trajectories of a moving cell for a long period of time.

In the model, both connections and disconnections can be propagated from the current to the next snapshot with probability $\\omega \\in [0, 1)$. Otherwise, with probability $1-\\omega$, connections are reestablished according to the random hyperbolic graphs model. We show that while the persistence probability $\\omega$ affects the averages of the contact and intercontact distributions, it does not affect the tails of these distributions, which decay as power laws with exponents that do not depend on $\\omega$. We also consider examples of real temporal networks and show that the considered model can adequately reproduce several of their dynamical properties. Our results advance our understanding of realistically modeling of temporal networks and of the effects of link persistence. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is essential for quantum computing to mitigate the effect of errors on qubits, and Surface code (SC) is one of the most promising QEC methods. Decoding SCs is the most computational expensive task in the control device of quantum computers (QCs), and many works focus on accurate decoding algorithms for SCs, including ones with neural networks (NNs). Practical QCs also require low-latency decoding because slow decoding leads to the accumulation of errors on qubits, resulting in logical failures. For QCs with superconducting qubits, a practical decoder must be very power-efficient in addition to high accuracy and low latency. In order to reduce the hardware complexity of QC, we are supposed to decode SCs in a cryogenic environment with a limited power budget, where superconducting qubits operate. In this paper, we propose an NN-based accurate, fast, and low-power decoder capable of decoding SCs and lattice surgery (LS) operations with measurement errors on ancillary qubits. To achieve both accuracy and hardware efficiency of SC decoder, we apply a binarized neural network. We design a neural processing unit (NPU) for the decoder with SFQ-based digital circuits and evaluate it with a SPICE-level simulation. We evaluate the decoder performance by a quantum error simulator for the single logical qubit protection and the minimum operation of LS with code distances up to 13, and it achieves 2.5% and 1.0% accuracy thresholds, respectively.

In this work, we propose a solution to this problem: a feed-forward neural network (NN) designed to predict a functional response using scalar inputs. First, we transform the functional response to a finite-dimension representation and then we construct a NN that outputs this representation. We proposed different objective functions to train the NN. The proposed models are suited for both regularly and irregularly spaced data and also provide multiple ways to apply a roughness penalty to control the smoothness of the predicted curve. The difficulty in implementing both those features lies in the definition of objective functions that can be back-propagated. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the conventional function-on-scalar regression model in multiple scenarios while computationally scaling better with the dimension of the predictors.

    "abstract": "In this work we focus on automatic segmentation of multiple anatomical structures in (whole body) CT images. Many segmentation algorithms exist for this task. However, in most cases they suffer from 3 problems: 1. They are difficult to use (the code and data is not publicly available or difficult to use). 2. They do not generalize (often the training dataset was curated to only contain very clean images which do not reflect the image distribution found during clinical routine), 3. The algorithm can only segment one anatomical structure. For more structures several algorithms have to be used which increases the effort required to set up the system. In this work we publish a new dataset and segmentation toolkit which solves all three of these problems: In 1204 CT images we segmented 104 anatomical structures (27 organs, 59 bones, 10 muscles, 8 vessels) covering a majority of relevant classes for most use cases. We show an improved workflow for the creation of ground truth segmentations which speeds up the process by over 10x. The CT images were randomly sampled from clinical routine, thus representing a real world dataset which generalizes to clinical application. The dataset contains a wide range of different pathologies, scanners, sequences and sites. Finally, we train a segmentation algorithm on this new dataset. We call this algorithm TotalSegmentator and make it easily available as a pretrained python pip package (pip install totalsegmentator). Usage is as simple as TotalSegmentator -i ct.nii.gz -o seg and it works well for most CT images. The code is available at https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator and the dataset at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6802613. ",

    "abstract": "Context. Blob detection is a common problem in astronomy. One example is in stellar population modelling, where the distribution of stellar ages and metallicities in a galaxy is inferred from observations. In this context, blobs may correspond to stars born in-situ versus those accreted from satellites, and the task of blob detection is to disentangle these components. A difficulty arises when the distributions come with significant uncertainties, as is the case for stellar population recoveries inferred from modelling spectra of unresolved stellar systems. There is currently no satisfactory method for blob detection with uncertainties. Aims. We introduce a method for uncertainty-aware blob detection developed in the context of stellar population modelling of integrated-light spectra of stellar systems. Methods. We develop theory and computational tools for an uncertainty-aware version of the classic Laplacian-of-Gaussians method for blob detection, which we call ULoG. This identifies significant blobs considering a variety of scales. As a prerequisite to apply ULoG to stellar population modelling, we introduce a method for efficient computation of uncertainties for spectral modelling. This method is based on the truncated Singular Value Decomposition and Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling (SVD-MCMC). Results. We apply the methods to data of the star cluster M54. We show that the SVD-MCMC inferences match those from standard MCMC, but are a factor 5-10 faster to compute. We apply ULoG to the inferred M54 age/metallicity distributions, identifying between 2 or 3 significant, distinct populations amongst its stars. ",

In fact, our proposed post-processing method offers a reliable way of directly estimating the lesion existence uncertainty. Experimental results on Gad lesion detection show our point-based method performs competitively compared to training on expensive segmentation labels. Finally, our detection model provides a suitable pre-training for segmentation. When fine-tuning on only 17 segmentation samples, we achieve comparable performance to training with the full dataset.

While many methods have been developed for each task individually, statistical challenges arise when applying these methods jointly: estimating causal effects after running causal discovery algorithms on the same data leads to \"double dipping,\" invalidating coverage guarantees of classical confidence intervals. To this end, we develop tools for valid post-causal-discovery inference. One key contribution is a randomized version of the greedy equivalence search (GES) algorithm, which permits a valid, finite-sample correction of classical confidence intervals. Across empirical studies, we show that a naive combination of causal discovery and subsequent inference algorithms typically leads to highly inflated miscoverage rates; at the same time, our noisy GES method provides reliable coverage control while achieving more accurate causal graph recovery than data splitting.

Partition pooling can be used to adopt successful image recognition architectures for graph neural network applications in particle physics. The reduced computational resources allow for deeper networks and more extensive hyperparameter optimizations. To show its applicability, we construct a convolutional graph network with partition pooling that reconstructs simulated interaction vertices for an idealized neutrino detector. The pooling network yields improved performance and is less susceptible to overfitting than a similar network without pooling. The lower resource requirements allow the construction of a deeper network with further improved performance. ",

To this end, we introduce novel classes of robust control barrier functions (RCBF) and robust control Lyapunov functions (RCLF) that facilitate the synthesis of safety-critical controllers in the presence of parametric uncertainty using quadratic programming. Since the initial bounds on the system uncertainty may be highly conservative, we present a data-driven approach to reducing such bounds using input-output data collected online. In particular, we leverage an integral set-membership identification algorithm that iteratively shrinks the set of possible system parameters online and guarantees stability and safety during learning. The efficacy of the developed approach is illustrated on two numerical examples. ",
