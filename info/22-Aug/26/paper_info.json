    "abstract": "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) are defined as a collection of highly stressful, and potentially traumatic, events or circumstances that occur throughout childhood and/or adolescence. They have been shown to be associated with increased risks of mental health diseases or other abnormal behaviours in later lives. However, the identification of ACEs from textual data with Natural Language Processing (NLP) is challenging because (a) there are no NLP ready ACE ontologies; (b) there are few resources available for machine learning, necessitating the data annotation from clinical experts; (c) costly annotations by domain experts and large number of documents for supporting large machine learning models. In this paper, we present an ontology-driven self-supervised approach (derive concept embeddings using an auto-encoder from baseline NLP results) for producing a publicly available resource that would support large-scale machine learning (e.g., training transformer based large language models) on social media corpus. This resource as well as the proposed approach are aimed to facilitate the community in training transferable NLP models for effectively surfacing ACEs in low-resource scenarios like NLP on clinical notes within Electronic Health Records. The resource including a list of ACE ontology terms, ACE concept embeddings and the NLP annotated corpus is available at https://github.com/knowlab/ACE-NLP. ",

    "title": "Wasserstein Task Embedding for Measuring Task Similarities",
    "abstract": "Measuring similarities between different tasks is critical in a broad spectrum of machine learning problems, including transfer, multi-task, continual, and meta-learning. Most current approaches to measuring task similarities are architecture-dependent: 1) relying on pre-trained models, or 2) training networks on tasks and using forward transfer as a proxy for task similarity. In this paper, we leverage the optimal transport theory and define a novel task embedding for supervised classification that is model-agnostic, training-free, and capable of handling (partially) disjoint label sets. In short, given a dataset with ground-truth labels, we perform a label embedding through multi-dimensional scaling and concatenate dataset samples with their corresponding label embeddings. Then, we define the distance between two datasets as the 2-Wasserstein distance between their updated samples. Lastly, we leverage the 2-Wasserstein embedding framework to embed tasks into a vector space in which the Euclidean distance between the embedded points approximates the proposed 2-Wasserstein distance between tasks. We show that the proposed embedding leads to a significantly faster comparison of tasks compared to related approaches like the Optimal Transport Dataset Distance (OTDD). Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed embedding through various numerical experiments and show statistically significant correlations between our proposed distance and the forward and backward transfer between tasks.

Extensive experiments show that HPOD works with both deep (e.g., Robust AutoEncoder) and shallow (e.g., Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and Isolation Forest (iForest)) OD algorithms on both discrete and continuous HP spaces, and outperforms a wide range of baselines with on average 58% and 66% performance improvement over the default HPs of LOF and iForest.

    "abstract": "Cost-sensitive classification is critical in applications where misclassification errors widely vary in cost. However, over-parameterization poses fundamental challenges to the cost-sensitive modeling of deep neural networks (DNNs). The ability of a DNN to fully interpolate a training dataset can render a DNN, evaluated purely on the training set, ineffective in distinguishing a cost-sensitive solution from its overall accuracy maximization counterpart. This necessitates rethinking cost-sensitive classification in DNNs. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a cost-sensitive adversarial data augmentation (CSADA) framework to make over-parameterized models cost-sensitive. The overarching idea is to generate targeted adversarial examples that push the decision boundary in cost-aware directions. These targeted adversarial samples are generated by maximizing the probability of critical misclassifications and used to train a model with more conservative decisions on costly pairs. Experiments on well-known datasets and a pharmacy medication image (PMI) dataset made publicly available show that our method can effectively minimize the overall cost and reduce critical errors, while achieving comparable performance in terms of overall accuracy.

    "abstract": "Person re-identification (re-ID) via 3D skeletons is an important emerging topic with many merits. Existing solutions rarely explore valuable body-component relations in skeletal structure or motion, and they typically lack the ability to learn general representations with unlabeled skeleton data for person re-ID. This paper proposes a generic unsupervised Skeleton Prototype Contrastive learning paradigm with Multi-level Graph Relation learning (SPC-MGR) to learn effective representations from unlabeled skeletons to perform person re-ID. Specifically, we first construct unified multi-level skeleton graphs to fully model body structure within skeletons. Then we propose a multi-head structural relation layer to comprehensively capture relations of physically-connected body-component nodes in graphs. A full-level collaborative relation layer is exploited to infer collaboration between motion-related body parts at various levels, so as to capture rich body features and recognizable walking patterns. Lastly, we propose a skeleton prototype contrastive learning scheme that clusters feature-correlative instances of unlabeled graph representations and contrasts their inherent similarity with representative skeleton features (\"skeleton prototypes\") to learn discriminative skeleton representations for person re-ID. Empirical evaluations show that SPC-MGR significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods, and it also achieves highly competitive person re-ID performance for more general scenarios.

We derive a closed-form solution of this optimization problem for energy-constrained waveforms and present a detailed analysis of the achievable SINR. Moreover, we analyze the SINR for systems transmitting constant-modulus waveforms, which are often used in practice. We propose an efficient constant-modulus waveform design algorithm to maximize the SINR.

In this paper, we present Region-to-Object Representation Learning (R2O) which unifies region-based and object-centric pretraining. R2O operates by training an encoder to dynamically refine region-based segments into object-centric masks and then jointly learns representations of the contents within the mask. R2O uses a \"region refinement module\" to group small image regions, generated using a region-level prior, into larger regions which tend to correspond to objects by clustering region-level features. As pretraining progresses, R2O follows a region-to-object curriculum which encourages learning region-level features early on and gradually progresses to train object-centric representations. Representations learned using R2O lead to state-of-the art performance in semantic segmentation for PASCAL VOC (+0.7 mIOU) and Cityscapes (+0.4 mIOU) and instance segmentation on MS COCO (+0.3 mask AP). Further, after pretraining on ImageNet, R2O pretrained models are able to surpass existing state-of-the-art in unsupervised object segmentation on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011 dataset (+2.9 mIoU) without any further training.

The second is a classification system that incorporates the prediction of the undefended network with a hard vote on the ensemble of filtered images. Our evaluations on the CIFAR10 dataset show our system improves the robustness of an undefended network against a variety of bounded and unbounded white-box attacks under different distance metrics, while sacrificing little accuracy on clean images.

Robustness of connectivity and controllability guarantees the system to function properly and stably under various malicious attacks.

In this paper, we investigate the performance of CNN-based approaches for connectivity and controllability robustness prediction, when partial network information is missing, namely the adjacency matrix is incomplete. Extensive experimental studies are carried out. A threshold is explored that if a total amount of more than 7.29\\% information is lost, the performance of CNN-based prediction will be significantly degenerated for all cases in the experiments. Two scenarios of missing edge representations are compared, 1) a missing edge is marked `no edge' in the input for prediction, and 2) a missing edge is denoted using a special marker of `unknown'. Experimental results reveal that the first representation is misleading to the CNN-based predictors. ",

We show the convergence behavior of the learning process by deriving an upper bound on its optimality gap. Furthermore, we define an optimization problem to reduce this upper bound and the total privacy leakage. To find the locally optimal solutions of this problem, we first propose an algorithm that schedules the resource blocks and users. We then extend this scheme to reduce the total privacy leakage by optimizing the differential privacy artificial noise. We apply the solutions of these two procedures as parameters of a federated learning system. In this setting, we assume that each user is equipped with a classifier. Moreover, the communication cells are assumed to have mostly fewer resource blocks than numbers of users. The simulation results show that our proposed scheduler improves the average accuracy of the predictions compared with a random scheduler. Furthermore, its extended version with noise optimizer significantly reduces the amount of privacy leakage. ",

    "abstract": "Conventional neural structures tend to communicate through analog quantities such as currents or voltages, however, as CMOS devices shrink and supply voltages decrease, the dynamic range of voltage/current-domain analog circuits becomes narrower, the available margin becomes smaller, and noise immunity decreases. More than that, the use of operational amplifiers (op-amps) and clocked or asynchronous comparators in conventional designs leads to high energy consumption and large chip area, which would be detrimental to building spiking neural networks. In view of this, we propose a neural structure for generating and transmitting time-domain signals, including a neuron module, a synapse module, and two weight modules. The proposed neural structure is driven by leakage currents in the transistor triode region and does not use op-amps and comparators, thus providing higher energy and area efficiency compared to conventional designs. In addition, the structure provides greater noise immunity due to internal communication via time-domain signals, which simplifies the wiring between the modules. The proposed neural structure is fabricated using TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology. The proposed neuron and synapse occupy an area of 127 um2 and 231 um2, respectively, while achieving millisecond time constants. Actual chip measurements show that the proposed structure successfully implements the temporal signal communication function with millisecond time constants, which is a critical step toward hardware reservoir computing for human-computer interaction.

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is a promising technology with enormous applications in almost every walk of life. One of the crucial applications of WSNs is intrusion detection and surveillance at the border areas and in the defense establishments. The border areas are stretched in hundreds to thousands of miles, hence, it is not possible to patrol the entire border region. As a result, an enemy may enter from any point absence of surveillance and cause the loss of lives or destroy the military establishments. WSNs can be a feasible solution for the problem of intrusion detection and surveillance at the border areas. Detection of an enemy at the border areas and nearby critical areas such as military cantonments is a time-sensitive task as a delay of few seconds may have disastrous consequences. Therefore, it becomes imperative to design systems that are able to identify and detect the enemy as soon as it comes in the range of the deployed system. In this paper, we have proposed a deep learning architecture based on a fully connected feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for the accurate prediction of the number of k-barriers for fast intrusion detection and prevention. We have trained and evaluated the feed-forward ANN model using four potential features, namely area of the circular region, sensing range of sensors, the transmission range of sensors, and the number of sensor for Gaussian and uniform sensor distribution. These features are extracted through Monte Carlo simulation. In doing so, we found that the model accurately predicts the number of k-barriers for both Gaussian and uniform sensor distribution with correlation coefficient (R = 0.78) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 41.15) for the former and R = 0.79 and RMSE = 48.36 for the latter. Further, the proposed approach outperforms the other benchmark algorithms in terms of accuracy and computational time complexity. ",

With growing credit card transaction volumes and rising fraud percentages there is growing interest in finding appropriate machine learning classifiers for detection. However, fraud data sets are diverse and exhibit inconsistent characteristics. As a result, a model effective on a given data set is not guaranteed to perform on another. Further, the possibility of temporal drift in data patterns and characteristics over time is high. Additionally, fraud data has massive and varying imbalance. In this work, we evaluate sampling methods as a viable pre-processing mechanism to handle imbalance and propose a data-driven classifier selection strategy for characteristic highly imbalanced fraud detection data sets. The model derived based on our selection strategy surpasses peer models, whilst working in more realistic conditions, establishing the effectiveness of the strategy. ",

    "abstract": "For autonomous robots navigating in urban environments, it is important for the robot to stay on the designated path of travel (i.e., the footpath), and avoid areas such as grass and garden beds, for safety and social conformity considerations. This paper presents an autonomous navigation approach for unknown urban environments that combines the use of semantic segmentation and LiDAR data. The proposed approach uses the segmented image mask to create a 3D obstacle map of the environment, from which, the boundaries of the footpath is computed. Compared to existing methods, our approach does not require a pre-built map and provides a 3D understanding of the safe region of travel, enabling the robot to plan any path through the footpath. Experiments comparing our method with two alternatives using only LiDAR or only semantic segmentation show that overall our proposed approach performs significantly better with greater than 91% success rate outdoors, and greater than 66% indoors. Our method enabled the robot to remain on the safe path of travel at all times, and reduced the number of collisions. ",

    "abstract": "We propose a new method for learning a generalized animatable neural human representation from a sparse set of multi-view imagery of multiple persons. The learned representation can be used to synthesize novel view images of an arbitrary person from a sparse set of cameras, and further animate them with the user's pose control. While existing methods can either generalize to new persons or synthesize animations with user control, none of them can achieve both at the same time. We attribute this accomplishment to the employment of a 3D proxy for a shared multi-person human model, and further the warping of the spaces of different poses to a shared canonical pose space, in which we learn a neural field and predict the person- and pose-dependent deformations, as well as appearance with the features extracted from input images. To cope with the complexity of the large variations in body shapes, poses, and clothing deformations, we design our neural human model with disentangled geometry and appearance. Furthermore, we utilize the image features both at the spatial point and on the surface points of the 3D proxy for predicting person- and pose-dependent properties. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts on both tasks. The video and code are available at https://talegqz.github.io/neural_novel_actor. ",

In order to fully realize the benefit of DL-aided wireless system, we need to collect a large number of training samples.

In this paper, we propose a new type of data acquisition framework for DL-aided wireless systems. In our work, generative adversarial network (GAN) is used to generate samples approximating the real samples. To reduce the amount of training samples required for the wireless data generation, we train GAN with the help of the meta learning. From numerical experiments, we show that the DL model trained by the GAN generated samples performs close to that trained by the real samples. ",

    "abstract": "Most digital audio tampering detection methods based on electrical network frequency (ENF) only utilize the static spatial information of ENF, ignoring the variation of ENF in time series, which limit the ability of ENF feature representation and reduce the accuracy of tampering detection. This paper proposes a new method for digital audio tampering detection based on ENF spatio-temporal features representation learning. A parallel spatio-temporal network model is constructed using CNN and BiLSTM, which deeply extracts ENF spatial feature information and ENF temporal feature information to enhance the feature representation capability to improve the tampering detection accuracy. In order to extract the spatial and temporal features of the ENF, this paper firstly uses digital audio high-precision Discrete Fourier Transform analysis to extract the phase sequences of the ENF. The unequal phase series is divided into frames by adaptive frame shifting to obtain feature matrices of the same size to represent the spatial features of the ENF. At the same time, the phase sequences are divided into frames based on ENF time changes information to represent the temporal features of the ENF. Then deep spatial and temporal features are further extracted using CNN and BiLSTM respectively, and an attention mechanism is used to adaptively assign weights to the deep spatial and temporal features to obtain spatio-temporal features with stronger representation capability. Finally, the deep neural network is used to determine whether the audio has been tampered with. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy by 2.12%-7.12% compared with state-of-the-art methods under the public database Carioca, New Spanish. ",

Providing a scalable overview of long sequences of such dynamic networks remains challenging due to the underlying large-scale data containing elusive topological changes. We propose two complementary pixel-based visualizations, which reflect occurrences of selected sub-networks (motifs) and provide a time-scalable overview of dynamic networks: a network-level census (motif significance profiles) linked with a node-level sub-network metric (graphlet degree vectors) views to reveal structural changes, trends, states, and outliers. The network census captures significantly occurring motifs compared to their expected occurrences in random networks and exposes structural changes in a dynamic network. The sub-network metrics display the local topological neighborhood of a node in a single network belonging to the dynamic network. The linked pixel-based visualizations allow exploring motifs in different-sized networks to analyze the changing structures within and across dynamic networks, for instance, to visually analyze the shape and rate of changes in the network topology. We describe the identification of visual patterns, also considering different reordering strategies to emphasize visual patterns. We demonstrate the approach's usefulness by a use case analysis based on real-world large-scale dynamic networks, such as the evolving social networks of Reddit or Facebook. ",

Many rail breaks occur as a heavy-haul train passes over a crack, large defect or defective weld. In such cases, it is usually too late for the train to slow down in time to prevent a de-railment. Knowing the risk of a rail break occurring associated with a train passing over a section of rail allows for better implementation of maintenance initiatives and mitigating measures. In this paper the Ore Line's specific challenges are discussed and the currently available data that can be used to create a rail break risk prediction model is reviewed. The development of a basic rail break risk prediction model for the Ore Line is then presented. Finally the insight gained from the model is demonstrated by means of discussing various scenarios of various rail break risk. In future work, we are planning on extending this basic model to allow input from live monitoring systems such as the ultrasonic broken rail detection system. ",

We evaluate TEP-GNN using four real-life Java open source programs, based on 922 test files mined from the projects' public repositories. We find that our approach achieves a high Pearson correlation of 0.789, considerable outperforming a baseline deep learning model. However, we also find that more work is needed for trained models to generalize to unseen projects. Our work demonstrates that FA-ASTs and GNNs are a feasible approach for predicting absolute performance values, and serves as an important intermediary step towards being able to predict the performance of arbitrary code prior to execution.

This article introduces a novel overbooking-promoted forward trading mechanism named Overbook in Advance, Trade in Future (OATF), where computing resources can be traded across three parties, i.e. end-users, an edge server and a remote cloud server, under a hybrid device-edge-cloud network with uncertainties (e.g., \"no shows\"). More importantly, OATF encourages a feasible overbooking rate that allows the edge server to overbook resources to multiple end-users (e.g., exceed the resource supply), while purchasing backup resources from the cloud server, by determining rights and obligations associated with forward contracts in advance via analyzing historical statistics (e.g., network, resource dynamics). Such a mechanism can greatly improve time efficiency and resource utilization thanks to overbooking and pre-signed forward contracts. Critical issues such as overbooking rate design and risk management are carefully investigated in this article, while an interesting case study is proposed with mathematical analysis. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that OATF achieves mutually beneficial utilities for different parties (cloud, edge, and end-users), as well as substantial resource usage and commendable time efficiency, in comparison with conventional trading methods.

It is shown how this measure can be used to design LID-aware graph embedding algorithms by formulating two LID-elastic variants of node2vec with personalized hyperparameters that are adjusted according to NC-LID values. Our empirical analysis of NC-LID on a large number of real-world graphs shows that this measure is able to point to nodes with high link reconstruction errors in node2vec embeddings better than node centrality metrics. The experimental evaluation also shows that the proposed LID-elastic node2vec extensions improve node2vec by better preserving graph structure in generated embeddings. ",

Based on the results obtained in the first phase, to model the thermodynamic performance of the aforementioned engine cycle, Flight-Mach number and flight altitude are considered to be 2.5 and 30,000 m, respectively; due to the operational advantage of supersonic flying at high altitude flight conditions, and the higher thrust of hydrogen fuel.

In the attained deep neural model, the pressure ratio of the high-pressure turbine, fan pressure ratio, turbine inlet temperature, intake air temperature, and bypass ratio are considered input parameters.

    "abstract": "VQA is an ambitious task aiming to answer any image-related question. However, in reality, it is hard to build such a system once for all since the needs of users are continuously updated, and the system has to implement new functions. Thus, Continual Learning (CL) ability is a must in developing advanced VQA systems. Recently, a pioneer work split a VQA dataset into disjoint answer sets to study this topic. However, CL on VQA involves not only the expansion of label sets (new Answer sets). It is crucial to study how to answer questions when deploying VQA systems to new environments (new Visual scenes) and how to answer questions requiring new functions (new Question types). Thus, we propose CLOVE, a benchmark for Continual Learning On Visual quEstion answering, which contains scene- and function-incremental settings for the two aforementioned CL scenarios. In terms of methodology, the main difference between CL on VQA and classification is that the former additionally involves expanding and preventing forgetting of reasoning mechanisms, while the latter focusing on class representation. Thus, we propose a real-data-free replay-based method tailored for CL on VQA, named Scene Graph as Prompt for Symbolic Replay. Using a piece of scene graph as a prompt, it replays pseudo scene graphs to represent the past images, along with correlated QA pairs. A unified VQA model is also proposed to utilize the current and replayed data to enhance its QA ability. Finally, experimental results reveal challenges in CLOVE and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/showlab/CLVQA. ",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving distributed machine learning framework recently. It aims at collaboratively learning a shared global model by performing distributed training locally on edge devices and aggregating local models into a global one without centralized raw data sharing in the cloud server. However, due to the large local data heterogeneities (Non-I.I.D. data) across edge devices, the FL may easily obtain a global model that can produce more shifted gradients on local datasets, thereby degrading the model performance or even suffering from the non-convergence during training. In this paper, we propose a novel FL training framework, dubbed Fed-FSNet, using a properly designed Fuzzy Synthesizing Network (FSNet) to mitigate the Non-I.I.D. FL at-the-source. Concretely, we maintain an edge-agnostic hidden model in the cloud server to estimate a less-accurate while direction-aware inversion of the global model. The hidden model can then fuzzily synthesize several mimic I.I.D. data samples (sample features) conditioned on only the global model, which can be shared by edge devices to facilitate the FL training towards faster and better convergence. Moreover, since the synthesizing process involves neither access to the parameters/updates of local models nor analyzing individual local model outputs, our framework can still ensure the privacy of FL. Experimental results on several FL benchmarks demonstrate that our method can significantly mitigate the Non-I.I.D. issue and obtain better performance against other representative methods. ",

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently received much attention due to their capabilities in solving both forward and inverse problems. For training a deep neural network associated with a PINN, one typically constructs a total loss function using a weighted sum of different loss terms and then tries to minimize that. This approach often becomes problematic for solving stiff equations since it cannot consider adaptive increments. Many studies reported the poor performance of the PINN and its challenges in simulating stiff chemical active issues with administering conditions of stiff ordinary differential conditions (ODEs). Studies show that stiffness is the primary cause of the failure of the PINN in simulating stiff kinetic systems. Here, we address this issue by proposing a reduced weak-form of the loss function, which led to a new PINN architecture, further named as Reduced-PINN, that utilizes a reduced-order integration method to enable the PINN to solve stiff chemical kinetics. The proposed Reduced-PINN can be applied to various reaction-diffusion systems involving stiff dynamics. To this end, we transform initial value problems (IVPs) to their equivalent integral forms and solve the resulting integral equations using physics-informed neural networks. In our derived integral-based optimization process, there is only one term without explicitly incorporating loss terms associated with ordinary differential equation (ODE) and initial conditions (ICs). To illustrate the capabilities of Reduced-PINN, we used it to simulate multiple stiff/mild second-order ODEs. We show that Reduced-PINN captures the solution accurately for a stiff scalar ODE. We also validated the Reduced-PINN against a stiff system of linear ODEs. ",

    "abstract": "Environmental perception with multi-modal fusion of radar and camera is crucial in autonomous driving to increase the accuracy, completeness, and robustness. This paper focuses on how to utilize millimeter-wave (MMW) radar and camera sensor fusion for 3D object detection. A novel method which realizes the feature-level fusion under bird-eye view (BEV) for a better feature representation is proposed. Firstly, radar features are augmented with temporal accumulation and sent to a temporal-spatial encoder for radar feature extraction. Meanwhile, multi-scale image 2D features which adapt to various spatial scales are obtained by image backbone and neck model. Then, image features are transformed to BEV with the designed view transformer. In addition, this work fuses the multi-modal features with a two-stage fusion model called point fusion and ROI fusion, respectively. Finally, a detection head regresses objects category and 3D locations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method realizes the state-of-the-art performance under the most important detection metrics, mean average precision (mAP) and nuScenes detection score (NDS) on the challenging nuScenes dataset.

Diverse and complex fault tolerance policies are adopted to enhance reliability, that include a varied mix of redundancy and dynamic reconfiguration to address hardware reliability, as well as specific software reliability techniques like diversity or software rejuvenation. These complex policies call for flexible runtime health checks of system executions that go beyond conventional runtime monitoring of pre-programmed health conditions, also in order to minimize maintenance costs. Defining a suitable monitoring model in the application of this method in complex systems is still a challenge. In this paper we propose a novel approach, Reliability Based Monitoring (RBM), for a flexible runtime monitoring of reliability in complex systems, that exploits a hierarchical reliability model periodically applied to runtime diagnostics data: this allows to dynamically plan maintenance activities aimed at prevent failures.

    "abstract": "Analysis of algorithms on time-varying networks (often called evolving graphs) is a modern challenge in theoretical computer science. The edge-Markovian is a relatively simple and comprehensive model of evolving graphs: every pair of vertices which is not a current edge independently becomes an edge with probability $p$ at each time-step, as well as every edge disappears with probability $q$. Clearly, the edge-Markovian graph changes its shape depending on the current shape, and the dependency refuses some useful techniques for an independent sequence of random graphs which often behaves similarly to a static random graph. It motivates this paper to develop a new technique for analysis of algorithms on edge-Markovian evolving graphs. Specifically speaking, this paper is concerned with load-balancing, which is a popular subject in distributed computing, and we analyze the so-called random matching algorithms, which is a standard scheme for load-balancing. We prove that major random matching algorithms achieve nearly optimal load balance in $O(r \\log (\\Delta n))$ steps on edge-Markovian evolving graphs, where $r = \\max\\{p/(1-q), (1-q)/p\\}$, $n$ is the number of vertices (i.e., processors) and $\\Delta$ denotes the initial gap of loads unbalance. We remark that the independent sequences of random graphs correspond to $r=1$. To avoid the difficulty of an analysis caused by a complex correlation with the history of an execution, we develop a simple proof technique based on history-independent bounds. As far as we know, this is the first theoretical analysis of load-balancing on randomly evolving graphs, not only for the edge-Markovian but also for the independent sequences of random graphs. ",

Given its computational complexity, several optimization-based methods have been proposed to lighten the full unit commitment formulation by removing redundant line flow constraints. These approaches often ignore the spatial couplings of multi-side renewable generation and demand. To address this pitfall, we rule out redundant constraints over a tightened linear programming relaxation of the original unit commitment feasibility region by adding a constraint that efficiently models the correlation of residual demand variations. We set forth a novel, tractable and robust polyhedral uncertainty envelope induced by a given set of scenarios to characterize the tightening constraint. We propose a data-driven umbrella constraint discovery problem formulation that substantially increase the network constraints filtration in unit commitment.

The dataset is an ongoing effort to facilitate accurate measurement of individual food and nutrient intake in low and middle income countries with passive monitoring camera technologies. The current dataset involves 20 households (74 subjects) from both the rural and urban regions of Ghana, and two different types of wearable cameras were used in the studies. Once initiated, wearable cameras continuously capture subjects' activities, which yield massive amounts of data to be cleaned and annotated before analysis is conducted. To ease the data post-processing and annotation tasks, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework to cluster the large volume of egocentric images into separate events. Each event consists of a sequence of temporally continuous and contextually similar images. By clustering images into separate events, annotators and dietitians can examine and analyze the data more efficiently and facilitate the subsequent dietary assessment processes. Validated on a held-out test set with ground truth labels, the proposed framework outperforms baselines in terms of clustering quality and classification accuracy. ",

An expressive class of graphical models, \\textit{relational causal models}, can represent and reason about complex dynamic systems exhibiting such cycles or feedback loops. Existing cyclic causal discovery algorithms for learning causal models from observational data assume that the data instances are independent and identically distributed which makes them unsuitable for relational causal models. At the same time, causal discovery algorithms for relational causal models assume acyclicity. In this work, we examine the necessary and sufficient conditions under which a constraint-based relational causal discovery algorithm is sound and complete for \\textit{cyclic relational causal models}. We introduce \\textit{relational acyclification}, an operation specifically designed for relational models that enables reasoning about the identifiability of cyclic relational causal models. We show that under the assumptions of relational acyclification and $\\sigma$-faithfulness, the relational causal discovery algorithm RCD (Maier et al. 2013) is sound and complete for cyclic models.

ORide is one of the early RHS proposals published at USENIX Security Symposium 2017. In the ORide protocol, riders and drivers, operating in a zone, encrypt their locations using a Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption scheme (SHE) and forward them to the Service Provider (SP). SP homomorphically computes the squared Euclidean distance between riders and available drivers. Rider receives the encrypted distances and selects the optimal rider after decryption. In order to prevent a triangulation attack, SP randomly permutes the distances before sending them to the rider. In this work, we use propose a passive attack that uses triangulation to determine coordinates of all participating drivers whose permuted distances are available from the points of view of multiple honest-but-curious adversary riders. An attack on ORide was published at SAC 2021. The same paper proposes a countermeasure using noisy Euclidean distances to thwart their attack. We extend our attack to determine locations of drivers when given their permuted and noisy Euclidean distances from multiple points of reference, where the noise perturbation comes from a uniform distribution. We conduct experiments with different number of drivers and for different perturbation values. Our experiments show that we can determine locations of all drivers participating in the ORide protocol. For the perturbed distance version of the ORide protocol, our algorithm reveals locations of about 25% to 50% of participating drivers. Our algorithm runs in time polynomial in number of drivers. ",

Such problems are now known as multi-objective optimization problems with heterogeneous objectives (HE-MOPs). So far, however, only a few studies have been reported to address HE-MOPs, and most of them focus on bi-objective problems with one fast objective and one slow objective. In this work, we aim to deal with HE-MOPs having more than two black-box and heterogeneous objectives. To this end, we develop a multi-objective Bayesian evolutionary optimization approach to HE-MOPs by exploiting the different data sets on the cheap and expensive objectives in HE-MOPs to alleviate the search bias caused by the heterogeneous evaluation costs for evaluating different objectives. To make the best use of two different training data sets, one with solutions evaluated on all objectives and the other with those only evaluated on the fast objectives, two separate Gaussian process models are constructed. In addition, a new acquisition function that mitigates search bias towards the fast objectives is suggested, thereby achieving a balance between convergence and diversity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by testing it on widely used multi-/many-objective benchmark problems whose objectives are assumed to be heterogeneously expensive. ",

Instead, we are provided a $similarity$ $matrix$ $W$, where $W_{ij}$ reports the number of hyperedges containing both $i$ and $j$. Under this information model, Kim, Bandeira, and Goemans [KBG18] determined the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery, and proposed a semidefinite programming relaxation which they conjectured to be optimal. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture. We also show that a simple, highly efficient spectral algorithm is optimal, establishing the spectral algorithm as the method of choice. Our analysis of the spectral algorithm crucially relies on strong $entrywise$ bounds on the eigenvectors of $W$. Our bounds are inspired by the work of Abbe, Fan, Wang, and Zhong [AFWZ20], who developed entrywise bounds for eigenvectors of symmetric matrices with independent entries.

    "title": "Deep neural networks for fast acquisition of aortic 3D pressure and  velocity flow fields",
    "abstract": "Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can be used to simulate vascular haemodynamics and analyse potential treatment options. CFD has shown to be beneficial in improving patient outcomes. However, the implementation of CFD for routine clinical use is yet to be realised. Barriers for CFD include high computational resources, specialist experience needed for designing simulation set-ups, and long processing times. The aim of this study was to explore the use of machine learning (ML) to replicate conventional aortic CFD with automatic and fast regression models. Data used to train/test the model comprised of 3,000 CFD simulations performed on synthetically generated 3D aortic shapes. These subjects were generated from a statistical shape model (SSM) built on real patient-specific aortas (N=67). Inference performed on 200 test shapes resulted in average errors of 6.01% +/-3.12 SD and 3.99% +/-0.93 SD for pressure and velocity, respectively. Our ML-based models performed CFD in ~0.075 seconds (4,000x faster than the solver). This study shows that results from conventional vascular CFD can be reproduced using ML at a much faster rate, in an automatic process, and with high accuracy. ",

    "title": "Lifelong Learning for Neural powered Mixed Integer Programming",
    "abstract": "Mixed Integer programs (MIPs) are typically solved by the Branch-and-Bound algorithm. Recently, Learning to imitate fast approximations of the expert strong branching heuristic has gained attention due to its success in reducing the running time for solving MIPs. However, existing learning-to-branch methods assume that the entire training data is available in a single session of training. This assumption is often not true, and if the training data is supplied in continual fashion over time, existing techniques suffer from catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we study the hitherto unexplored paradigm of Lifelong Learning to Branch on Mixed Integer Programs. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we propose LIMIP, which is powered by the idea of modeling an MIP instance in the form of a bipartite graph, which we map to an embedding space using a bipartite Graph Attention Network. This rich embedding space avoids catastrophic forgetting through the application of knowledge distillation and elastic weight consolidation, wherein we learn the parameters key towards retaining efficacy and are therefore protected from significant drift. We evaluate LIMIP on a series of NP-hard problems and establish that in comparison to existing baselines, LIMIP is up to 50% better when confronted with lifelong learning. ",

    "abstract": "In this draft article, we consider the problem of achieving safe control of a dynamic system for which the safety index or (control barrier function (loosely)) has relative degree equal to two. We consider parameter affine nonlinear dynamic systems and assume that the parametric uncertainty is uniform and known a-priori or being updated online through an estimator/parameter adaptation law. Under this uncertainty, the usual CBF-QP safe control approach takes the form of a robust optimization problem. Both the right hand side and left hand side of the inequality constraints depend on the unknown parameter. With the given representation of uncertainty, the CBF-QP safe control ends up being a convex semi-infinite problem. Using two different philosophies, one based on weak duality and another based on the Lossless s-procedure, we arrive at identical SDP formulations of this robust CBF-QP problem. Thus we show that the problem of computing safe controls with known parametric uncertainty can be posed as a tractable convex problem and be solved online. (This is work in progress). ",
