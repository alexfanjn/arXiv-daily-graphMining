    "title": "Learning on Graphs for Mineral Asset Valuation Under Supply and Demand  Uncertainty",
    "abstract": "Valuing mineral assets is a challenging task that is highly dependent on the supply (geological) uncertainty surrounding resources and reserves, and the uncertainty of demand (commodity prices). In this work, a graph-based reasoning, modeling and solution approach is proposed to jointly address mineral asset valuation and mine plan scheduling and optimization under supply and demand uncertainty in the \"mining complex\" framework. Three graph-based solutions are proposed: (i) a neural branching policy that learns a block-sampling ore body representation, (ii) a guiding policy that learns to explore a heuristic selection tree, (iii) a hyper-heuristic that manages the value/supply chain optimization and dynamics modeled as a graph structure. Results on two large-scale industrial mining complexes show a reduction of up to three orders of magnitude in primal suboptimality, execution time, and number of iterations, and an increase of up to 40% in the mineral asset value.

This representation can be used to solve complex problems such as recommendation systems and question answering. In this study, a set of candidate drugs for COVID-19 are proposed by using Drug repurposing knowledge graph (DRKG). DRKG is a biological knowledge graph constructed using a vast amount of open source biomedical knowledge to understand the mechanism of compounds and the related biological functions. Node and relation embeddings are learned using knowledge graph embedding models and neural network and attention related models. Different models are used to get the node embedding by changing the objective of the model. These embeddings are later used to predict if a candidate drug is effective to treat a disease or how likely it is for a drug to bind to a protein associated to a disease which can be modelled as a link prediction task between two nodes.

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have constantly achieved better performance over years by introducing more complex topology, and enlarging the capacity towards deeper and wider CNNs. This makes the manual design of CNNs extremely difficult, so the automated design of CNNs has come into the research spotlight, which has obtained CNNs that outperform manually-designed CNNs. However, the computational cost is still the bottleneck of automatically designing CNNs. In this paper, inspired by transfer learning, a new evolutionary computation based framework is proposed to efficiently evolve CNNs without compromising the classification accuracy. The proposed framework leverages multi-source domains, which are smaller datasets than the target domain datasets, to evolve a generalised CNN block only once. And then, a new stacking method is proposed to both widen and deepen the evolved block, and a grid search method is proposed to find optimal stacking solutions. The experimental results show the proposed method acquires good CNNs faster than 15 peer competitors within less than 40 GPU-hours. Regarding the classification accuracy, the proposed method gains its strong competitiveness against the peer competitors, which achieves the best error rates of 3.46%, 18.36% and 1.76% for the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets, respectively.

    "abstract": "Along with the widespread use of face recognition systems, their vulnerability has become highlighted. While existing face anti-spoofing methods can be generalized between attack types, generic solutions are still challenging due to the diversity of spoof characteristics. Recently, the spoof trace disentanglement framework has shown great potential for coping with both seen and unseen spoof scenarios, but the performance is largely restricted by the single-modal input. This paper focuses on this issue and presents a multi-modal disentanglement model which targetedly learns polysemantic spoof traces for more accurate and robust generic attack detection. In particular, based on the adversarial learning mechanism, a two-stream disentangling network is designed to estimate spoof patterns from the RGB and depth inputs, respectively. In this case, it captures complementary spoofing clues inhering in different attacks. Furthermore, a fusion module is exploited, which recalibrates both representations at multiple stages to promote the disentanglement in each individual modality. It then performs cross-modality aggregation to deliver a more comprehensive spoof trace representation for prediction. Extensive evaluations are conducted on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that learning polysemantic spoof traces favorably contributes to anti-spoofing with more perceptible and interpretable results.

    "abstract": "As ride-hailing services become increasingly popular, being able to accurately predict demand for such services can help operators efficiently allocate drivers to customers, and reduce idle time, improve congestion, and enhance the passenger experience. This paper proposes UberNet, a deep learning Convolutional Neural Network for short-term prediction of demand for ride-hailing services. UberNet empploys a multivariate framework that utilises a number of temporal and spatial features that have been found in the literature to explain demand for ride-hailing services. The proposed model includes two sub-networks that aim to encode the source series of various features and decode the predicting series, respectively. To assess the performance and effectiveness of UberNet, we use 9 months of Uber pickup data in 2014 and 28 spatial and temporal features from New York City. By comparing the performance of UberNet with several other approaches, we show that the prediction quality of the model is highly competitive. Further, Ubernet's prediction performance is better when using economic, social and built environment features. This suggests that Ubernet is more naturally suited to including complex motivators in making real-time passenger demand predictions for ride-hailing services. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, automated co-design of machine learning (ML) models and accelerator architectures has attracted significant attention from both the industry and academia. However, most co-design frameworks either explore a limited search space or employ suboptimal exploration techniques for simultaneous design decision investigations of the ML model and the accelerator. Furthermore, training the ML model and simulating the accelerator performance is computationally expensive. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel neural architecture and hardware accelerator co-design framework, called CODEBench. It is composed of two new benchmarking sub-frameworks, CNNBench and AccelBench, which explore expanded design spaces of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and CNN accelerators. CNNBench leverages an advanced search technique, BOSHNAS, to efficiently train a neural heteroscedastic surrogate model to converge to an optimal CNN architecture by employing second-order gradients. AccelBench performs cycle-accurate simulations for a diverse set of accelerator architectures in a vast design space. With the proposed co-design method, called BOSHCODE, our best CNN-accelerator pair achieves 1.4% higher accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset compared to the state-of-the-art pair, while enabling 59.1% lower latency and 60.8% lower energy consumption. On the ImageNet dataset, it achieves 3.7% higher Top1 accuracy at 43.8% lower latency and 11.2% lower energy consumption. CODEBench outperforms the state-of-the-art framework, i.e., Auto-NBA, by achieving 1.5% higher accuracy and 34.7x higher throughput, while enabling 11.0x lower energy-delay product (EDP) and 4.0x lower chip area on CIFAR-10.

    "abstract": "Searching for a path between two nodes in a graph is one of the most well-studied and fundamental problems in computer science. In numerous domains such as robotics, AI, or biology, practitioners develop search heuristics to accelerate their pathfinding algorithms. However, it is a laborious and complex process to hand-design heuristics based on the problem and the structure of a given use case. Here we present PHIL (Path Heuristic with Imitation Learning), a novel neural architecture and a training algorithm for discovering graph search and navigation heuristics from data by leveraging recent advances in imitation learning and graph representation learning. At training time, we aggregate datasets of search trajectories and ground-truth shortest path distances, which we use to train a specialized graph neural network-based heuristic function using backpropagation through steps of the pathfinding process. Our heuristic function learns graph embeddings useful for inferring node distances, runs in constant time independent of graph sizes, and can be easily incorporated in an algorithm such as A* at test time. Experiments show that PHIL reduces the number of explored nodes compared to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets by 58.5\\% on average, can be directly applied in diverse graphs ranging from biological networks to road networks, and allows for fast planning in time-critical robotics domains.

These generative models then predict variant likelihood as a proxy to evolutionary fitness. In this work we instead combine this evolutionary principle with pretrained protein language models (LMs), which have already shown promising results in predicting protein structure and function. Instead of training separate models per-gene, we find that a single protein LM trained on broad sequence datasets can score pathogenicity for any gene variant zero-shot, without MSAs or finetuning. We call this unsupervised approach \\textbf{VELM} (Variant Effect via Language Models), and show that it achieves scoring performance comparable to the state of the art when evaluated on clinically labeled variants of disease-related genes.

We show that under the capture model, when the spatial topology of the network is considered, AoI can be significantly improved, and we obtain tight performance bounds on weighted sum and min-max AoI. Finally, we design a policy where each node sets its transmission probability based only on its own distance from the base station, when it does not know the positions of other nodes, and show that it converges to the optimal proportionally fair policy as the size of the network goes to infinity.

    "abstract": "Gathering properly labelled, adequately rich, and case-specific data for successfully training a data-driven or hybrid model for structural health monitoring (SHM) applications is a challenging task. We posit that a Transfer Learning (TL) method that utilizes available data in any relevant source domain and directly applies to the target domain through domain adaptation can provide substantial remedies to address this issue. Accordingly, we present a novel TL method that differentiates between the source's no-damage and damage cases and utilizes a domain adaptation (DA) technique. The DA module transfers the accumulated knowledge in contrasting no-damage and damage cases in the source domain to the target domain, given only the target's no-damage case. High-dimensional features allow employing signal processing domain knowledge to devise a generalizable DA approach. The Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture is adopted for learning since its optimization process accommodates high-dimensional inputs in a zero-shot setting. At the same time, its training objective conforms seamlessly with the case of no-damage and damage data in SHM since its discriminator network differentiates between real (no damage) and fake (possibly unseen damage) data. An extensive set of experimental results demonstrates the method's success in transferring knowledge on differences between no-damage and damage cases across three strongly heterogeneous independent target structures. The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curves (Area Under the Curve - AUC) is used to evaluate the differentiation between no-damage and damage cases in the target domain, reaching values as high as 0.95. With no-damage and damage cases discerned from each other, zero-shot structural damage detection is carried out. The mean F1 scores for all damages in the three independent datasets are 0.978, 0.992, and 0.975. ",

Although FAU detection has been actively studied using ideally high quality images, it was not thoroughly studied under heavily occluded conditions. In this paper, we propose the first occlusion-robust FAU recognition method to maintain FAU detection performance under heavy occlusions. Our novel approach takes advantage of rich information from the latent space of masked autoencoder (MAE) and transforms it into FAU features. Bypassing the occlusion reconstruction step, our model efficiently extracts FAU features of occluded faces by mining the latent space of a pretrained masked autoencoder. Both node and edge-level knowledge distillation are also employed to guide our model to find a mapping between latent space vectors and FAU features. Facial occlusion conditions, including random small patches and large blocks, are thoroughly studied. Experimental results on BP4D and DISFA datasets show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performances under the studied facial occlusion, significantly outperforming existing baseline methods. In particular, even under heavy occlusion, the proposed method can achieve comparable performance as state-of-the-art methods under normal conditions. ",

The key challenge is that algorithmic recourse involves interventions in the physical world, which is fundamentally a causal problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose an interpretable Anomaly Detection framework using Causal Algorithmic Recourse (ADCAR), which recommends recourse actions and infers counterfactual of abnormal samples guided by the causal mechanism.

Cross Entropy (CE) loss has been shown to be not robust to noisy labels due to its unboundedness. To alleviate this issue, existing works typically design specialized robust losses with the symmetric condition, which usually lead to the underfitting issue. In this paper, our key idea is to induce a loss bound at the logit level, thus universally enhancing the noise robustness of existing losses. Specifically, we propose logit clipping (LogitClip), which clamps the norm of the logit vector to ensure that it is upper bounded by a constant. In this manner, CE loss equipped with our LogitClip method is effectively bounded, mitigating the overfitting to examples with noisy labels. Moreover, we present theoretical analyses to certify the noise-tolerant ability of LogitClip. Extensive experiments show that LogitClip not only significantly improves the noise robustness of CE loss, but also broadly enhances the generalization performance of popular robust losses. ",

    "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently been proposed to solve scientific and engineering problems, where physical laws are introduced into neural networks as prior knowledge. With the embedded physical laws, PINNs enable the estimation of critical parameters, which are unobservable via physical tools, through observable variables. For example, Power Electronic Converters (PECs) are essential building blocks for the green energy transition. PINNs have been applied to estimate the capacitance, which is unobservable during PEC operations, using current and voltage, which can be observed easily during operations. The estimated capacitance facilitates self-diagnostics of PECs. Existing PINNs are often manually designed, which is time-consuming and may lead to suboptimal performance due to a large number of design choices for neural network architectures and hyperparameters. In addition, PINNs are often deployed on different physical devices, e.g., PECs, with limited and varying resources. Therefore, it requires designing different PINN models under different resource constraints, making it an even more challenging task for manual design. To contend with the challenges, we propose Automated Physics-Informed Neural Networks (AutoPINN), a framework that enables the automated design of PINNs by combining AutoML and PINNs. Specifically, we first tailor a search space that allows finding high-accuracy PINNs for PEC internal parameter estimation. We then propose a resource-aware search strategy to explore the search space to find the best PINN model under different resource constraints. We experimentally demonstrate that AutoPINN is able to find more accurate PINN models than human-designed, state-of-the-art PINN models using fewer resources. ",

However, most of the existing data augmentation methods are heuristic, lacking the exploration of their internal mechanisms. We apply the explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method, explore the internal mechanisms of popular data augmentation methods, analyze the relationship between game interactions and some widely used robustness metrics, and propose a new proxy for model robustness in the open-set environment. Based on the analysis of the internal mechanisms, we develop a mask-based boosting method for data augmentation that comprehensively improves several robustness measures of AI models and beats state-of-the-art data augmentation approaches. Experiments show that our method can be widely applied to many popular data augmentation methods. Different from the adversarial training, our boosting method not only significantly improves the robustness of models, but also improves the accuracy of test sets.

This paper designs CRCs for rate-(n-1)/n CCs with short blocklengths, considering both the ZT and TB cases. The CRC design seeks to optimize the frame error rate (FER) performance of the code resulting from the concatenation of the CRC and the CC. Utilization of the dual trellis proposed by Yamada et al. lowers the complexity of CRC-aided serial list Viterbi decoding (SLVD) of ZTCCs and TBCCs. CRC-aided SLVD of the TBCCs closely approaches the RCU bound at a blocklength of 128. Application of the multi-trellis approach and Wrap Around Viterbi Algorithm (WAVA) further improves the decoding efficiency while maintaining the decoder's error-detection and correction performance.

Secondly, to more rationally incorporate human knowledge into the training process of neural networks, we design a new loss function that enables the network to learn user-modified information.

In brief, on the one hand, due to the poor recognizability and viewpoint differences between images, it is inevitable to inaccurately annotate some keypoints with offset and confusion, leading to the mismatch between two associated nodes, i.e., NNC. On the other hand, the noisy node-to-node correspondence will further contaminate the edge-to-edge correspondence, thus leading to ENC. For the BNC challenge, we propose a novel method termed Contrastive Matching with Momentum Distillation. Specifically, the proposed method is with a robust quadratic contrastive loss which enjoys the following merits: i) better exploring the node-to-node and edge-to-edge correlations through a GM customized quadratic contrastive learning paradigm; ii) adaptively penalizing the noisy assignments based on the confidence estimated by the momentum teacher. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the robustness of our model compared with 12 competitive baselines. ",

Recently, two-stage self-training methods have achieved significant improvements by self-generating pseudo labels and self-refining anomaly scores with these labels. As the pseudo labels play a crucial role, we propose an enhancement framework by exploiting completeness and uncertainty properties for effective self-training. Specifically, we first design a multi-head classification module (each head serves as a classifier) with a diversity loss to maximize the distribution differences of predicted pseudo labels across heads. This encourages the generated pseudo labels to cover as many abnormal events as possible. We then devise an iterative uncertainty pseudo label refinement strategy, which improves not only the initial pseudo labels but also the updated ones obtained by the desired classifier in the second stage. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches on the UCF-Crime, TAD, and XD-Violence benchmark datasets. ",

Recent works leverage the capabilities of large language models (LMs) to perform complex question answering in a few-shot setting by demonstrating how to output intermediate rationalizations while solving the complex question in a single pass. We introduce ``Successive Prompting'', where we iteratively break down a complex task into a simple task, solve it, and then repeat the process until we get the final solution. Successive prompting decouples the supervision for decomposing complex questions from the supervision for answering simple questions, allowing us to (1) have multiple opportunities to query in-context examples at each reasoning step (2) learn question decomposition separately from question answering, including using synthetic data, and (3) use bespoke (fine-tuned) components for reasoning steps where a large LM does not perform well. The intermediate supervision is typically manually written, which can be expensive to collect. We introduce a way to generate a synthetic dataset which can be used to bootstrap a model's ability to decompose and answer intermediate questions. Our best model (with successive prompting) achieves an improvement of ~5% absolute F1 on a few-shot version of the DROP dataset when compared with a state-of-the-art model with the same supervision.

In this paper, we propose a physics-guided data augmentation (PGDA) method to improve the accuracy and generalization of neural operator models. Training data is augmented naturally through the physical properties of differential equations such as linearity and translation. We demonstrate the advantage of PGDA on a variety of linear differential equations, showing that PGDA can improve the sample complexity and is robust to distributional shift. ",

    "abstract": "Trajectory prediction is an integral component of modern autonomous systems as it allows for envisioning future intentions of nearby moving agents. Due to the lack of other agents' dynamics and control policies, deep neural network (DNN) models are often employed for trajectory forecasting tasks. Although there exists an extensive literature on improving the accuracy of these models, there is a very limited number of works studying their robustness against adversarially crafted input trajectories. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a targeted adversarial attack against DNN models for trajectory forecasting tasks. We call the proposed attack TA4TP for Targeted adversarial Attack for Trajectory Prediction. Our approach generates adversarial input trajectories that are capable of fooling DNN models into predicting user-specified target/desired trajectories. Our attack relies on solving a nonlinear constrained optimization problem where the objective function captures the deviation of the predicted trajectory from a target one while the constraints model physical requirements that the adversarial input should satisfy. The latter ensures that the inputs look natural and they are safe to execute (e.g., they are close to nominal inputs and away from obstacles). We demonstrate the effectiveness of TA4TP on two state-of-the-art DNN models and two datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first targeted adversarial attack against DNN models used for trajectory forecasting. ",

We also incorporate an auxiliary image reconstruction objective to help train the latent graph representations.

The high security in blockchain is undoubtedly a critical factor for the network to handle important data item. On the other hand, according to the dilemma in blockchain, an overemphasis on distributed security will lead to poor transaction-processing capability, which limits the application of blockchain in data sharing scenarios with high-throughput and low-latency requirements. To enable demand-oriented distributed services, this paper investigates the relationship between capability and security in blockchain from the perspective of block propagation and forking problem. First, a Markov chain is introduced to analyze the gossiping-based block propagation among edge servers, which aims to derive block propagation delay and forking probability. Then, we study the impact of forking on blockchain capability and security metrics, in terms of transaction throughput, confirmation delay, fault tolerance, and the probability of malicious modification. The analytical results show that with the adjustment of block generation time or block size, transaction throughput improves at the sacrifice of fault tolerance, and vice versa. Meanwhile, the decline in security can be offset by adjusting confirmation threshold, at the cost of increasing confirmation delay. The analysis of capability-security trade-off can provide a theoretical guideline to manage blockchain performance based on the requirements of data sharing scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Digital security has been an active area of research interest due to the rapid adaptation of internet infrastructure, the increasing popularity of social media, and digital cameras. Due to inherent differences in working principles to generate an image, different camera brands left behind different intrinsic processing noises which can be used to identify the camera brand. In the last decade, many signal processing and deep learning-based methods have been proposed to identify and isolate this noise from the scene details in an image to detect the source camera brand. One prominent solution is to utilize a hierarchical classification system rather than the traditional single-classifier approach. Different individual networks are used for brand-level and model-level source camera identification. This approach allows for better scaling and requires minimal modifications for adding a new camera brand/model to the solution. However, using different full-fledged networks for both brand and model-level classification substantially increases memory consumption and training complexity. Moreover, extracted low-level features from the different network's initial layers often coincide, resulting in redundant weights. To mitigate the training and memory complexity, we propose a classifier-block-level hierarchical system instead of a network-level one for source camera model classification. Our proposed approach not only results in significantly fewer parameters but also retains the capability to add a new camera model with minimal modification. Thorough experimentation on the publicly available Dresden dataset shows that our proposed approach can achieve the same level of state-of-the-art performance but requires fewer parameters compared to a state-of-the-art network-level hierarchical-based system.

MUS finetunes a pre-trained encoder model on the citation graph by link prediction tasks. Then, the abstract sentences are extracted from the corresponding paper considering multi-granularity information. Preliminary results demonstrate that citation graph is helpful even in a simple unsupervised framework. Motivated by this, we next propose a Graph-based Supervised Summarization model (GSS) to achieve more accurate results on the task when large-scale labeled data are available. Apart from employing the link prediction as an auxiliary task, GSS introduces a gated sentence encoder and a graph information fusion module to take advantage of the graph information to polish the sentence representation.

    "abstract": "Privacy-preserving inference via edge or encrypted computing paradigms encourages users of machine learning services to confidentially run a model on their personal data for a target task and only share the model's outputs with the service provider; e.g., to activate further services. Nevertheless, despite all confidentiality efforts, we show that a ''vicious'' service provider can approximately reconstruct its users' personal data by observing only the model's outputs, while keeping the target utility of the model very close to that of a ''honest'' service provider. We show the possibility of jointly training a target model (to be run at users' side) and an attack model for data reconstruction (to be secretly used at server's side). We introduce the ''reconstruction risk'': a new measure for assessing the quality of reconstructed data that better captures the privacy risk of such attacks. Experimental results on 6 benchmark datasets show that for low-complexity data types, or for tasks with larger number of classes, a user's personal data can be approximately reconstructed from the outputs of a single target inference task. We propose a potential defense mechanism that helps to distinguish vicious vs. honest classifiers at inference time. We conclude this paper by discussing current challenges and open directions for future studies. We open-source our code and results, as a benchmark for future work. ",

    "abstract": "The paradigm shift of enabling extensive intercommunication between the Operational Technology (OT) and Information Technology (IT) devices allows vulnerabilities typical to the IT world to propagate to the OT side. Therefore, the security layer offered in the past by air gapping is removed, making security patching for OT devices a hard requirement. Conventional patching involves a device reboot to load the patched code in the main memory, which does not apply to OT devices controlling critical processes due to downtime, necessitating in-memory vulnerability patching. Furthermore, these control binaries are often compiled by in-house proprietary compilers, further hindering the patching process and placing reliance on OT vendors for rapid vulnerability discovery and patch development. The current state-of-the-art hotpatching approaches only focus on firmware and/or RTOS. Therefore, in this work, we develop ICSPatch, a framework to automate control logic vulnerability localization using Data Dependence Graphs (DDGs). With the help of DDGs, ICSPatch pinpoints the vulnerability in the control application. As an independent second step, ICSPatch can non-intrusively hotpatch vulnerabilities in the control application directly in the main memory of Programmable Logic Controllers while maintaining reliable continuous operation. To evaluate our framework, we test ICSPatch on a synthetic dataset of 24 vulnerable control application binaries from diverse critical infrastructure sectors. Results show that ICSPatch could successfully localize all vulnerabilities and generate patches accordingly. Furthermore, the patch added negligible latency increase in the execution cycle while maintaining correctness and protection against the vulnerability. ",

We propose editable neural radiance fields that enable end-users to easily edit dynamic scenes and even support topological changes. Input with an image sequence from a single camera, our network is trained fully automatically and models topologically varying dynamics using our picked-out surface key points. Then end-users can edit the scene by easily dragging the key points to desired new positions. To achieve this, we propose a scene analysis method to detect and initialize key points by considering the dynamics in the scene, and a weighted key points strategy to model topologically varying dynamics by joint key points and weights optimization. Our method supports intuitive multi-dimensional (up to 3D) editing and can generate novel scenes that are unseen in the input sequence. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality editing on various dynamic scenes and outperforms the state-of-the-art. We will release our code and captured data. ",

In this paper, to effectively improve the anti-disturbance control performance of the aerial manipulator, an adaptive neural network backstepping control method based on variable inertia parameter modeling is proposed. Firstly, for the intense internal coupling disturbance, we analyze and model it from the perspective of the generation mechanism of the coupling disturbance, and derive the dynamics model of the aerial manipulator system and the coupling disturbance model based on the variable inertia parameters. Through the proposed coupling disturbance model, we can compensate the strong coupling disturbance in a way of feedforward. Then, the adaptive neural network is proposed and applid to estimate and compensate the additional disturbances, and the closed-loop controller is designed based on the backstepping control method. Finally, we verify the correctness of the proposed coupling disturbance model through physical experiment under a large range motion of the manipulator. Two sets of comparative simulation results also prove the accurate estimation of the proposed adaptive neural network for additional disturbances and the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed control method.

    "abstract": "Bayesian networks (BNs) are a widely used graphical model in machine learning for representing knowledge with uncertainty. The mainstream BN structure learning methods require performing a large number of conditional independence (CI) tests. The learning process is very time-consuming, especially for high-dimensional problems, which hinders the adoption of BNs to more applications. Existing works attempt to accelerate the learning process with parallelism, but face issues including load unbalancing, costly atomic operations and dominant parallel overhead. In this paper, we propose a fast solution named Fast-BNS on multi-core CPUs to enhance the efficiency of the BN structure learning. Fast-BNS is powered by a series of efficiency optimizations including (i) designing a dynamic work pool to monitor the processing of edges and to better schedule the workloads among threads, (ii) grouping the CI tests of the edges with the same endpoints to reduce the number of unnecessary CI tests, (iii) using a cache-friendly data storage to improve the memory efficiency, and (iv) generating the conditioning sets on-the-fly to avoid extra memory consumption. A comprehensive experimental study shows that the sequential version of Fast-BNS is up to 50 times faster than its counterpart, and the parallel version of Fast-BNS achieves 4.8 to 24.5 times speedup over the state-of-the-art multi-threaded solution. Moreover, Fast-BNS has a good scalability to the network size as well as sample size. Fast-BNS source code is freely available at https://github.com/jjiantong/FastBN. ",

Existing transfer learning methods for NMT are static, which simply transfer knowledge from a parent model to a child model once via parameter initialization. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning method for NMT, namely ConsistTL, which can continuously transfer knowledge from the parent model during the training of the child model. Specifically, for each training instance of the child model, ConsistTL constructs the semantically-equivalent instance for the parent model and encourages prediction consistency between the parent and child for this instance, which is equivalent to the child model learning each instance under the guidance of the parent model. Experimental results on five low-resource NMT tasks demonstrate that ConsistTL results in significant improvements over strong transfer learning baselines, with a gain up to 1.7 BLEU over the existing back-translation model on the widely-used WMT17 Turkish-English benchmark. Further analysis reveals that ConsistTL can improve the inference calibration of the child model. Code and scripts are freely available at https://github.com/NLP2CT/ConsistTL. ",

However, human-driven verification leads to a time-consuming task and a bottleneck to have checked trustworthy information at the same pace they emerge. Since misinformation relates not only to the content itself but also to other social features, this paper addresses automatic misinformation checking in social networks from a multimodal perspective. Moreover, as simply naming a piece of news as incorrect may not convince the citizen and, even worse, strengthen confirmation bias, the proposal is a modality-level explainable-prone misinformation classifier framework. Our framework comprises a misinformation classifier assisted by explainable methods to generate modality-oriented explainable inferences. Preliminary findings show that the misinformation classifier does benefit from multimodal information encoding and the modality-oriented explainable mechanism increases both inferences' interpretability and completeness.

However, SSL recommender models are likely to suffer from spurious correlations, leading to poor generalization. To mitigate spurious correlations, existing work usually pursues ID-based SSL recommendation or utilizes feature engineering to identify spurious features. Nevertheless, ID-based SSL approaches sacrifice the positive impact of invariant features, while feature engineering methods require high-cost human labeling. To address the problems, we aim to automatically mitigate the effect of spurious correlations. This objective requires to 1) automatically mask spurious features without supervision, and 2) block the negative effect transmission from spurious features to other features during SSL. To handle the two challenges, we propose an invariant feature learning framework, which first divides user-item interactions into multiple environments with distribution shifts and then learns a feature mask mechanism to capture invariant features across environments. Based on the mask mechanism, we can remove the spurious features for robust predictions and block the negative effect transmission via mask-guided feature augmentation. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in mitigating spurious correlations and improving the generalization abilities of SSL models. ",

While most current research on compositionality has been directed towards improving performance of the representations on similarity tasks, this work proposes a methodology for measuring the presence of compositional behaviour in contemporary language models related to adjectival modifier phenomena in adjective-noun phrases. Our results show that current neural language models do not behave consistently according to the linguistic theories with regard to the evaluated intersective property, but on the other hand, the differences between adjective categories are noticeable in single adjective interactions, indicating that such differences are encoded in individual word representations, but they do not transfer generally in the expected way to the compositions. This raises the question of whether current language models are not capable of capturing the true underlying distributional properties of language, or whether linguistic theories from Montagovian tradition do not hold to distributional scrutiny.

To implement neural-like systems in silico, to emulate neural function, and to interface successfully with the brain, neuromorphic circuits need to encode information in a way compatible to that used by populations of neuron in the brain. To facilitate the cross-talk between neuromorphic engineering and neuroscience, in this Review we first critically examine and summarize emerging recent findings about how population of neurons encode and transmit information. We examine the effects on encoding and readout of information for different features of neural population activity, namely the sparseness of neural representations, the heterogeneity of neural properties, the correlations among neurons, and the time scales (from short to long) at which neurons encode information and maintain it consistently over time. Finally, we critically elaborate on how these facts constrain the design of information coding in neuromorphic circuits. We focus primarily on the implications for designing neuromorphic circuits that communicate with the brain, as in this case it is essential that artificial and biological neurons use compatible neural codes. However, we also discuss implications for the design of neuromorphic systems for implementation or emulation of neural computation. ",

Most normalizing flows for inverse problems in imaging employ the conditional affine coupling layer that can generate diverse images quickly. However, unintended severe artifacts are occasionally observed in the output of them. In this work, we address this critical issue by investigating the origins of these artifacts and proposing the conditions to avoid them. First of all, we empirically and theoretically reveal that these problems are caused by ``exploding variance'' in the conditional affine coupling layer for certain out-of-distribution (OOD) conditional inputs. Then, we further validated that the probability of causing erroneous artifacts in pixels is highly correlated with a Mahalanobis distance-based OOD score for inverse problems in imaging. Lastly, based on our investigations, we propose a remark to avoid exploding variance and then based on it, we suggest a simple remedy that substitutes the affine coupling layers with the modified rational quadratic spline coupling layers in normalizing flows, to encourage the robustness of generated image samples. Our experimental results demonstrated that our suggested methods effectively suppressed critical artifacts occurring in normalizing flows for super-resolution space generation and low-light image enhancement without compromising performance.

An AD environment naturally describes an attack graph where nodes represent computers/accounts/security groups, and edges represent existing accesses/known exploits that allow the attacker to gain access from one node to another. Motivated by practical AD use cases, we study a Stackelberg game between one attacker and one defender. There are multiple entry nodes for the attacker to choose from and there is a single target (Domain Admin). Every edge has a failure rate. The attacker chooses the attack path with the maximum success rate. The defender can block a limited number of edges (i.e., revoke accesses) from a set of blockable edges, limited by budget. The defender's aim is to minimize the attacker's success rate. We exploit the tree-likeness of practical AD graphs to design scalable algorithms. We propose two novel methods that combine theoretical fixed parameter analysis and practical optimisation techniques. For graphs with small tree widths, we propose a tree decomposition based dynamic program. We then propose a general method for converting tree decomposition based dynamic programs to reinforcement learning environments, which leads to an anytime algorithm that scales better, but loses the optimality guarantee. For graphs with small numbers of non-splitting paths (a parameter we invent specifically for AD graphs), we propose a kernelization technique that significantly downsizes the model, which is then solved via mixed-integer programming. Experimentally, our algorithms scale to handle synthetic AD graphs with tens of thousands of nodes. ",

A key element of reliable optimization for these systems is the modification of the loss function. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) modifies the underlying loss function to guide descent methods towards flatter minima, which arguably have better generalization abilities. In this paper, we focus on a variant of SAM known as mSAM, which, during training, averages the updates generated by adversarial perturbations across several disjoint shards of a mini-batch. Recent work suggests that mSAM can outperform SAM in terms of test accuracy. However, a comprehensive empirical study of mSAM is missing from the literature -- previous results have mostly been limited to specific architectures and datasets. To that end, this paper presents a thorough empirical evaluation of mSAM on various tasks and datasets. We provide a flexible implementation of mSAM and compare the generalization performance of mSAM to the performance of SAM and vanilla training on different image classification and natural language processing tasks. We also conduct careful experiments to understand the computational cost of training with mSAM, its sensitivity to hyperparameters and its correlation with the flatness of the loss landscape. Our analysis reveals that mSAM yields superior generalization performance and flatter minima, compared to SAM, across a wide range of tasks without significantly increasing computational costs. ",

On the other hand, DRAM has scalability problems due to its cost and energy consumption. NVM will likely coexist with DRAM in computer systems and the biggest challenge is to know which data to allocate on each type of memory. A state-of-the-art approach is AutoNUMA, in the Linux kernel. Prior work is limited to measuring AutoNUMA solely in terms of the application execution time, without understanding AutoNUMA's behavior. In this work we provide a more in-depth characterization of AutoNUMA, for instance, identifying where exactly a set of pages are allocated, while keeping track of promotion and demotion decisions performed by AutoNUMA. Our analysis shows that AutoNUMA's benefits can be modest when running graph processing applications, or graph analytics, because most pages have only one access over the entire execution time and other pages accesses have no temporal locality. We make a case for exploring application characteristics using object-level mappings between DRAM and NVM. Our preliminary experiments show that an object-level memory tiering can better capture the application behavior and reduce the execution time of graph analytics by 21% (avg) and 51% (max), when compared to AutoNUMA, while significantly reducing the number of memory accesses in NVM.

    "abstract": "Privacy protection raises great attention on both legal levels and user awareness. To protect user privacy, countries enact laws and regulations requiring software privacy policies to regulate their behavior. However, privacy policies are written in natural languages with many legal terms and software jargon that prevent users from understanding and even reading them. It is desirable to use NLP techniques to analyze privacy policies for helping users understand them. Furthermore, existing datasets ignore law requirements and are limited to English. In this paper, we construct the first Chinese privacy policy dataset, namely CA4P-483, to facilitate the sequence labeling tasks and regulation compliance identification between privacy policies and software. Our dataset includes 483 Chinese Android application privacy policies, over 11K sentences, and 52K fine-grained annotations. We evaluate families of robust and representative baseline models on our dataset. Based on baseline performance, we provide findings and potential research directions on our dataset. Finally, we investigate the potential applications of CA4P-483 combing regulation requirements and program analysis. ",

    "title": "CiaoSR: Continuous Implicit Attention-in-Attention Network for  Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution",
    "abstract": "Learning continuous image representations is recently gaining popularity for image super-resolution (SR) because of its ability to reconstruct high-resolution images with arbitrary scales from low-resolution inputs. Existing methods mostly ensemble nearby features to predict the new pixel at any queried coordinate in the SR image. Such a local ensemble suffers from some limitations: i) it has no learnable parameters and it neglects the similarity of the visual features; ii) it has a limited receptive field and cannot ensemble relevant features in a large field which are important in an image; iii) it inherently has a gap with real camera imaging since it only depends on the coordinate. To address these issues, this paper proposes a continuous implicit attention-in-attention network, called CiaoSR. We explicitly design an implicit attention network to learn the ensemble weights for the nearby local features. Furthermore, we embed a scale-aware attention in this implicit attention network to exploit additional non-local information. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate CiaoSR significantly outperforms the existing single image super resolution (SISR) methods with the same backbone. In addition, the proposed method also achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the arbitrary-scale SR task. The effectiveness of the method is also demonstrated on the real-world SR setting. More importantly, CiaoSR can be flexibly integrated into any backbone to improve the SR performance. ",

    "abstract": "In recent years, using a self-supervised learning framework to learn the general characteristics of graphs has been considered a promising paradigm for graph representation learning. The core of self-supervised learning strategies for graph neural networks lies in constructing suitable positive sample selection strategies. However, existing GNNs typically aggregate information from neighboring nodes to update node representations, leading to an over-reliance on neighboring positive samples, i.e., homophilous samples; while ignoring long-range positive samples, i.e., positive samples that are far apart on the graph but structurally equivalent samples, a problem we call \"neighbor bias.\" This neighbor bias can reduce the generalization performance of GNNs. In this paper, we argue that the generalization properties of GNNs should be determined by combining homogeneous samples and structurally equivalent samples, which we call the \"GC combination hypothesis.\" Therefore, we propose a topological signal-driven self-supervised method. It uses a topological information-guided structural equivalence sampling strategy. First, we extract multiscale topological features using persistent homology. Then we compute the structural equivalence of node pairs based on their topological features. In particular, we design a topological loss function to pull in non-neighboring node pairs with high structural equivalence in the representation space to alleviate neighbor bias. Finally, we use the joint training mechanism to adjust the effect of structural equivalence on the model to fit datasets with different characteristics. We conducted experiments on the node classification task across seven graph datasets. The results show that the model performance can be effectively improved using a strategy of topological signal enhancement. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have strong capabilities of memorizing the underlying training data, which can be a serious privacy concern. An effective solution to this problem is to train models with differential privacy, which provides rigorous privacy guarantees by injecting random noise to the gradients. This paper focuses on the scenario where sensitive data are distributed among multiple participants, who jointly train a model through federated learning (FL), using both secure multiparty computation (MPC) to ensure the confidentiality of each gradient update, and differential privacy to avoid data leakage in the resulting model. A major challenge in this setting is that common mechanisms for enforcing DP in deep learning, which inject real-valued noise, are fundamentally incompatible with MPC, which exchanges finite-field integers among the participants. Consequently, most existing DP mechanisms require rather high noise levels, leading to poor model utility. Motivated by this, we propose Skellam mixture mechanism (SMM), an approach to enforce DP on models built via FL. Compared to existing methods, SMM eliminates the assumption that the input gradients must be integer-valued, and, thus, reduces the amount of noise injected to preserve DP. Further, SMM allows tight privacy accounting due to the nice composition and sub-sampling properties of the Skellam distribution, which are key to accurate deep learning with DP. The theoretical analysis of SMM is highly non-trivial, especially considering (i) the complicated math of differentially private deep learning in general and (ii) the fact that the mixture of two Skellam distributions is rather complex, and to our knowledge, has not been studied in the DP literature. Extensive experiments on various practical settings demonstrate that SMM consistently and significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of the utility of the resulting model. ",

This problem carries significant importance for analyzing models of discrete spacetime in quantum gravity; inferring network geometry in network science; and manifold learning in data science. The key contribution of this paper is to introduce and validate a new estimator of discrete sectional curvature for random graphs with low metric-distortion. The latter are constructed via a specific graph sprinkling method on different manifolds with constant sectional curvature. We define a notion of metric distortion, which quantifies how well the graph metric approximates the metric of the underlying manifold. We show how graph sprinkling algorithms can be refined to produce hard annulus random geometric graphs with minimal metric distortion. We construct random geometric graphs for spheres, hyperbolic and euclidean planes; upon which we validate our curvature estimator. Numerical analysis reveals that the error of the estimated curvature diminishes as the mean metric distortion goes to zero, thus demonstrating convergence of the estimate. We also perform comparisons to other existing discrete curvature measures. Finally, we demonstrate two practical applications: (i) estimation of the earth's radius using geographical data; and (ii) sectional curvature distributions of self-similar fractals. ",

For example, feature-based explanations (e.g., SHAP) could expose the top important features that a black-box model focuses on. Such disclosure has been exploited to craft effective backdoor triggers against malware classifiers. To address this trade-off, we introduce a new concept of achieving local differential privacy (LDP) in the explanations, and from that we establish a defense, called XRand, against such attacks.

While previous work has made great efforts to model spatio-temporal correlations, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: i) Most models collectively predict all regions' flows without accounting for spatial heterogeneity, i.e., different regions may have skewed traffic flow distributions. ii) These models fail to capture the temporal heterogeneity induced by time-varying traffic patterns, as they typically model temporal correlations with a shared parameterized space for all time periods. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Self-Supervised Learning (ST-SSL) traffic prediction framework which enhances the traffic pattern representations to be reflective of both spatial and temporal heterogeneity, with auxiliary self-supervised learning paradigms. Specifically, our ST-SSL is built over an integrated module with temporal and spatial convolutions for encoding the information across space and time. To achieve the adaptive spatio-temporal self-supervised learning, our ST-SSL first performs the adaptive augmentation over the traffic flow graph data at both attribute- and structure-levels. On top of the augmented traffic graph, two SSL auxiliary tasks are constructed to supplement the main traffic prediction task with spatial and temporal heterogeneity-aware augmentation. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SSL consistently outperforms various state-of-the-art baselines. Since spatio-temporal heterogeneity widely exists in practical datasets, the proposed framework may also cast light on other spatial-temporal applications.

    "abstract": "Benefiting from masked visual modeling, self-supervised video representation learning has achieved remarkable progress. However, existing methods focus on learning representations from scratch through reconstructing low-level features like raw pixel RGB values. In this paper, we propose masked video distillation (MVD), a simple yet effective two-stage masked feature modeling framework for video representation learning: firstly we pretrain an image (or video) model by recovering low-level features of masked patches, then we use the resulting features as targets for masked feature modeling. For the choice of teacher models, we observe that students taught by video teachers perform better on temporally-heavy video tasks, while image teachers transfer stronger spatial representations for spatially-heavy video tasks. Visualization analysis also indicates different teachers produce different learned patterns for students. Motivated by this observation, to leverage the advantage of different teachers, we design a spatial-temporal co-teaching method for MVD. Specifically, we distill student models from both video teachers and image teachers by masked feature modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that video transformers pretrained with spatial-temporal co-teaching outperform models distilled with a single teacher on a multitude of video datasets. Our MVD with vanilla ViT achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with previous supervised or self-supervised methods on several challenging video downstream tasks. For example, with the ViT-Large model, our MVD achieves 86.4% and 75.9% Top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400 and Something-Something-v2, outperforming VideoMAE by 1.2% and 1.6% respectively.

On state-of-the-art superconducting quantum processors, readout errors can range from 1-10%. The error-prone nature of readout has resulted in significant research to design better discriminators to achieve higher qubit-readout accuracies. The readout accuracy impacts the benchmark fidelity for Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) applications or the logical error rate in error-correcting codes such as the surface code. Prior works have used machine-learning-assisted single-shot qubit-state classification, where a deep neural network was used for more robust discrimination by compensating for crosstalk errors. However, the neural network size can limit the scalability of systems, especially if fast hardware discrimination is required. This state-of-the-art baseline design cannot be implemented on off-the-shelf FPGAs used for the control and readout of superconducting qubits in most systems, which increases the overall readout latency, since discrimination has to be performed in software. In this work, we propose HERQULES, a scalable approach to improve qubit-state inference by using matched filters in conjunction with a significantly smaller and scalable neural network for qubit-state discrimination. We achieve substantially higher readout accuracies (16.4% relative improvement) than the baseline with a scalable design that can be readily implemented on off-the-shelf FPGAs. We also show that HERQULES is more versatile and can support shorter readout durations than the baseline design without additional training overheads. ",

    "abstract": "The paper addresses the problem of finding the causal direction between two associated variables. The proposed solution is to build an autoencoder of their joint distribution and to maximize its estimation capacity relative to both the marginal distributions. It is shown that the resulting two capacities cannot, in general, be equal. This leads to a new criterion for causal discovery: the higher capacity is consistent with the unconstrained choice of a distribution representing the cause while the lower capacity reflects the constraints imposed by the mechanism on the distribution of the effect. Estimation capacity is defined as the ability of the auto-encoder to represent arbitrary datasets. A regularization term forces it to decide which one of the variables to model in a more generic way i.e., while maintaining higher model capacity. The causal direction is revealed by the constraints encountered while encoding the data instead of being measured as a property of the data itself. The idea is implemented and tested using a restricted Boltzmann machine. ",

Here we consider how this social balance might be disrupted by the availability of lie-detection algorithms powered by Artificial Intelligence. Will people elect to use lie detection algorithms that perform better than humans, and if so, will they show less restraint in their accusations? We built a machine learning classifier whose accuracy (67\\%) was significantly better than human accuracy (50\\%) in a lie-detection task and conducted an incentivized lie-detection experiment in which we measured participants' propensity to use the algorithm, as well as the impact of that use on accusation rates. We find that the few people (33\\%) who elect to use the algorithm drastically increase their accusation rates (from 25\\% in the baseline condition up to 86% when the algorithm flags a statement as a lie). They make more false accusations (18pp increase), but at the same time, the probability of a lie remaining undetected is much lower in this group (36pp decrease). We consider individual motivations for using lie detection algorithms and the social implications of these algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "Image super-resolution (SR) is a technique to recover lost high-frequency information in low-resolution (LR) images. Spatial-domain information has been widely exploited to implement image SR, so a new trend is to involve frequency-domain information in SR tasks. Besides, image SR is typically application-oriented and various computer vision tasks call for image arbitrary magnification. Therefore, in this paper, we study image features in the frequency domain to design a novel scale-arbitrary image SR network. First, we statistically analyze LR-HR image pairs of several datasets under different scale factors and find that the high-frequency spectra of different images under different scale factors suffer from different degrees of degradation, but the valid low-frequency spectra tend to be retained within a certain distribution range. Then, based on this finding, we devise an adaptive scale-aware feature division mechanism using deep reinforcement learning, which can accurately and adaptively divide the frequency spectrum into the low-frequency part to be retained and the high-frequency one to be recovered. Finally, we design a scale-aware feature recovery module to capture and fuse multi-level features for reconstructing the high-frequency spectrum at arbitrary scale factors. Extensive experiments on public datasets show the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art methods. ",

However, lattice-free sequence discriminative training methods, which obtain superior performance in hybrid modes, are rarely investigated in RNN-Transducers. In this work, we propose three lattice-free training objectives, namely lattice-free maximum mutual information, lattice-free segment-level minimum Bayes risk, and lattice-free minimum Bayes risk, which are used for the final posterior output of the phoneme-based neural transducer with a limited context dependency. Compared to criteria using N-best lists, lattice-free methods eliminate the decoding step for hypotheses generation during training, which leads to more efficient training. Experimental results show that lattice-free methods gain up to 6.5% relative improvement in word error rate compared to a sequence-level cross-entropy trained model. Compared to the N-best-list based minimum Bayes risk objectives, lattice-free methods gain 40% - 70% relative training time speedup with a small degradation in performance. ",
