    "abstract": "Advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT) have enabled noninvasive imaging of substructures of the human retina with high spatial resolution. OCT examinations are now a standard procedure in clinics and an integral part of ophthalmic research. The interpretation of the OCT helps ophthalmologists understand the impact of various retinal and systemic diseases on the structure of the retina in a way not previously possible. In the early stages of retinal diseases, however, the identification and analysis of small and localized substructural changes in the retina remains a challenge. We present an overview of novel visual analytics approaches for the interactive exploration of early retinal changes in single and multiple patients, the comparison of the changes with normative data, and automated quantification and measurement of diagnosis-relevant information. We developed these approaches in close collaboration with ophthalmology researchers and industry experts from a leading OCT device manufacturer. As a result, they not only significantly reduced the time and effort required for OCT data analysis, especially in the context of cross-sectional studies, but have also led to several new discoveries published in biomedical journals.

    "abstract": "Video segmentation consists of a frame-by-frame selection process of meaningful areas related to foreground moving objects. Some applications include traffic monitoring, human tracking, action recognition, efficient video surveillance, and anomaly detection. In these applications, it is not rare to face challenges such as abrupt changes in weather conditions, illumination issues, shadows, subtle dynamic background motions, and also camouflage effects. In this work, we address such shortcomings by proposing a novel deep learning video segmentation approach that incorporates residual information into the foreground detection learning process. The main goal is to provide a method capable of generating an accurate foreground detection given a grayscale video. Experiments conducted on the Change Detection 2014 and on the private dataset PetrobrasROUTES from Petrobras support the effectiveness of the proposed approach concerning some state-of-the-art video segmentation techniques, with overall F-measures of $\\mathbf{0.9535}$ and $\\mathbf{0.9636}$ in the Change Detection 2014 and PetrobrasROUTES datasets, respectively. Such a result places the proposed technique amongst the top 3 state-of-the-art video segmentation methods, besides comprising approximately seven times less parameters than its top one counterpart.

    "abstract": "To keep up with the ever-growing performance demand of neural networks, specialized hardware (HW) accelerators are shifting towards multi-core and chiplet architectures. So far, these multi-accelerator systems exploit the increased parallelism by pipelining different NN layers across input batches on different cores to increase throughput. Yet, when pursuing this with non-batched layer-by-layer scheduling of latency-critical applications, this fails to fully exploit the available HW resources towards energy-efficient execution at the edge. This work, therefore, enables fine-grained depth-first scheduling of layer-fused DNNs onto multi-core architectures through an open-source modeling framework called Stream. Stream is capable of representing a wide range of scheduling granularities and HW architectures and optimizes execution schedules towards minimal energy, minimal latency and/or minimal memory footprint for constrained edge devices. We validate against three SotA HW implementations employing layer-fused scheduling showing tight matching with measured efficiencies. Using Stream in further explorations, we demonstrate that high-level architectural decisions greatly impact hardware efficiency under the fine-grained scheduling paradigm, reducing the energy-delay product from 2.4x for single-core architectures to up to 30x for heterogeneous multi-core architectures compared to the traditional scheduling at layer granularity.

    "abstract": "Molecular representation learning is crucial for the problem of molecular property prediction, where graph neural networks (GNNs) serve as an effective solution due to their structure modeling capabilities. Since labeled data is often scarce and expensive to obtain, it is a great challenge for GNNs to generalize in the extensive molecular space. Recently, the training paradigm of \"pre-train, fine-tune\" has been leveraged to improve the generalization capabilities of GNNs. It uses self-supervised information to pre-train the GNN, and then performs fine-tuning to optimize the downstream task with just a few labels. However, pre-training does not always yield statistically significant improvement, especially for self-supervised learning with random structural masking. In fact, the molecular structure is characterized by motif subgraphs, which are frequently occurring and influence molecular properties. To leverage the task-related motifs, we propose a novel paradigm of \"pre-train, prompt, fine-tune\" for molecular representation learning, named molecule continuous prompt tuning (MolCPT). MolCPT defines a motif prompting function that uses the pre-trained model to project the standalone input into an expressive prompt. The prompt effectively augments the molecular graph with meaningful motifs in the continuous representation space; this provides more structural patterns to aid the downstream classifier in identifying molecular properties. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that MolCPT efficiently generalizes pre-trained GNNs for molecular property prediction, with or without a few fine-tuning steps. ",

Especially inference attacks against Machine Learning models allow adversaries to infer sensitive information about the target model, such as training data, model parameters, etc. Inference attacks can lead to serious consequences, including violating individuals privacy, compromising the intellectual property of the owner of the machine learning model. As far as concerned, researchers have studied and analyzed in depth several types of inference attacks, albeit in isolation, but there is still a lack of a holistic rick assessment of inference attacks against machine learning models, such as their application in different scenarios, the common factors affecting the performance of these attacks and the relationship among the attacks. As a result, this paper performs a holistic risk assessment of different inference attacks against Machine Learning models. This paper focuses on three kinds of representative attacks: membership inference attack, attribute inference attack and model stealing attack. And a threat model taxonomy is established.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in solving various graph coloring problems in the streaming model. The initial algorithms in this line of work are all crucially randomized, raising natural questions about how important a role randomization plays in streaming graph coloring. A couple of very recent works have made progress on this question: they prove that deterministic or even adversarially robust coloring algorithms (that work on streams whose updates may depend on the algorithm's past outputs) are considerably weaker than standard randomized ones. However, there is still a significant gap between the upper and lower bounds for the number of colors needed (as a function of the maximum degree $\\Delta$) for robust coloring and multipass deterministic coloring. We contribute to this line of work by proving the following results. In the deterministic semi-streaming (i.e., $O(n \\cdot \\text{polylog } n)$ space) regime, we present an algorithm that achieves a combinatorially optimal $(\\Delta+1)$-coloring using $O(\\log{\\Delta} \\log\\log{\\Delta})$ passes. This improves upon the prior $O(\\Delta)$-coloring algorithm of Assadi, Chen, and Sun (STOC 2022) at the cost of only an $O(\\log\\log{\\Delta})$ factor in the number of passes. In the adversarially robust semi-streaming regime, we design an $O(\\Delta^{5/2})$-coloring algorithm that improves upon the previously best $O(\\Delta^{3})$-coloring algorithm of Chakrabarti, Ghosh, and Stoeckl (ITCS 2022). Further, we obtain a smooth colors/space tradeoff that improves upon another algorithm of the said work: whereas their algorithm uses $O(\\Delta^2)$ colors and $O(n\\Delta^{1/2})$ space, ours, in particular, achieves (i)~$O(\\Delta^2)$ colors in $O(n\\Delta^{1/3})$ space, and (ii)~$O(\\Delta^{7/4})$ colors in $O(n\\Delta^{1/2})$ space.

Towards this end, we propose an automated method for mining and classifying Ethereum's smart contract vulnerabilities and their corresponding fixes from GitHub and from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) records in the National Vulnerability Database. We implemented the proposed method in a fully automated framework, which we call AutoMESC. AutoMESC uses seven of the most well-known smart contract security tools to classify and label the collected vulnerabilities based on vulnerability types. Furthermore, it collects metadata that can be used in data-intensive smart contract security research (e.g., vulnerability detection, vulnerability classification, severity prediction, and automated repair). We used AutoMESC to construct a sample dataset and made it publicly available. Currently, the dataset contains 6.7K smart contracts' vulnerability-fix pairs written in Solidity. We assess the quality of the constructed dataset in terms of accuracy, provenance, and relevance, and compare it with existing datasets. AutoMESC is designed to collect data continuously and keep the corresponding dataset up-to-date with newly discovered smart contract vulnerabilities and their fixes from GitHub and CVE records. ",

These findings prompted large efforts aiming to understand and measure such effects, with the goal of providing benchmarks that can guide the development of techniques mitigating these stereotypical associations. However, as recent research has pointed out, the current benchmarks lack a robust experimental setup, consequently hindering the inference of meaningful conclusions from their evaluation metrics. In this paper, we extend these arguments and demonstrate that existing techniques and benchmarks aiming to measure stereotypes tend to be inaccurate and consist of a high degree of experimental noise that severely limits the knowledge we can gain from benchmarking language models based on them. Accordingly, we propose a new framework for robustly measuring and quantifying biases exhibited by generative language models. Finally, we use this framework to investigate GPT-3's occupational gender bias and propose prompting techniques for mitigating these biases without the need for fine-tuning. ",

    "abstract": "People living with dementia often exhibit behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia that can put their and others' safety at risk. Existing video surveillance systems in long-term care facilities can be used to monitor such behaviours of risk to alert the staff to prevent potential injuries or death in some cases. However, these behaviours of risk events are heterogeneous and infrequent in comparison to normal events. Moreover, analyzing raw videos can also raise privacy concerns. In this paper, we present two novel privacy-protecting video-based anomaly detection approaches to detect behaviours of risks in people with dementia. We either extracted body pose information as skeletons and use semantic segmentation masks to replace multiple humans in the scene with their semantic boundaries. Our work differs from most existing approaches for video anomaly detection that focus on appearance-based features, which can put the privacy of a person at risk and is also susceptible to pixel-based noise, including illumination and viewing direction. We used anonymized videos of normal activities to train customized spatio-temporal convolutional autoencoders and identify behaviours of risk as anomalies. We show our results on a real-world study conducted in a dementia care unit with patients with dementia, containing approximately 21 hours of normal activities data for training and 9 hours of data containing normal and behaviours of risk events for testing. We compared our approaches with the original RGB videos and obtained an equivalent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve performance of 0.807 for the skeleton-based approach and 0.823 for the segmentation mask-based approach. This is one of the first studies to incorporate privacy for the detection of behaviours of risks in people with dementia. ",

By applying a GLOW model, we disentangle the pixelwise correlation of images, which makes it difficult to protect privacy with straightforward LDP algorithms for images. Specifically, we map images onto the latent vector of the GLOW model, each element of which follows an independent normal distribution, and we apply the Laplace mechanism to the latent vector.

However, it remains underexplored how the appearance of such representations can be efficiently edited while maintaining photorealism. In this work, we present PaletteNeRF, a novel method for photorealistic appearance editing of neural radiance fields (NeRF) based on 3D color decomposition. Our method decomposes the appearance of each 3D point into a linear combination of palette-based bases (i.e., 3D segmentations defined by a group of NeRF-type functions) that are shared across the scene. While our palette-based bases are view-independent, we also predict a view-dependent function to capture the color residual (e.g., specular shading). During training, we jointly optimize the basis functions and the color palettes, and we also introduce novel regularizers to encourage the spatial coherence of the decomposition. Our method allows users to efficiently edit the appearance of the 3D scene by modifying the color palettes. We also extend our framework with compressed semantic features for semantic-aware appearance editing. We demonstrate that our technique is superior to baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively for appearance editing of complex real-world scenes. ",

    "abstract": "A central challenge of building more powerful Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is the oversmoothing phenomenon, where increasing the network depth leads to homogeneous node representations and thus worse classification performance. While previous works have only demonstrated that oversmoothing is inevitable when the number of graph convolutions tends to infinity, in this paper, we precisely characterize the mechanism behind the phenomenon via a non-asymptotic analysis. Specifically, we distinguish between two different effects when applying graph convolutions -- an undesirable mixing effect that homogenizes node representations in different classes, and a desirable denoising effect that homogenizes node representations in the same class. By quantifying these two effects on random graphs sampled from the Contextual Stochastic Block Model (CSBM), we show that oversmoothing happens once the mixing effect starts to dominate the denoising effect, and the number of layers required for this transition is $O(\\log N/\\log (\\log N))$ for sufficiently dense graphs with $N$ nodes. We also extend our analysis to study the effects of Personalized PageRank (PPR) on oversmoothing. Our results suggest that while PPR mitigates oversmoothing at deeper layers, PPR-based architectures still achieve their best performance at a shallow depth and are outperformed by the graph convolution approach on certain graphs. Finally, we support our theoretical results with numerical experiments, which further suggest that the oversmoothing phenomenon observed in practice may be exacerbated by the difficulty of optimizing deep GNN models.

However, research on the effectiveness of considering multiple heterogeneous domain information simultaneously is still under exploration, and if a model can take an advantage of integrating heterogeneous information, it is expected to exhibit a significant contribution to many problems in the world. This thesis works on Drug-Drug Interactions (DDIs) from the literature as a case study and realizes relation extraction utilizing heterogeneous domain information. First, a deep neural relation extraction model is prepared and its attention mechanism is analyzed. Next, a method to combine the drug molecular structure information and drug description information to the input sentence information is proposed, and the effectiveness of utilizing drug molecular structures and drug descriptions for the relation extraction task is shown. Then, in order to further exploit the heterogeneous information, drug-related items, such as protein entries, medical terms and pathways are collected from multiple existing databases and a new data set in the form of a knowledge graph (KG) is constructed. A link prediction task on the constructed data set is conducted to obtain embedding representations of drugs that contain the heterogeneous domain information. Finally, a method that integrates the input sentence information and the heterogeneous KG information is proposed. The proposed model is trained and evaluated on a widely used data set, and as a result, it is shown that utilizing heterogeneous domain information significantly improves the performance of relation extraction from the literature.

An adversary first adds a few carefully crafted points to the training dataset such that the impact on the model's predictions is minimal. The adversary subsequently triggers a request to remove a subset of the introduced points at which point the attack is unleashed and the model's predictions are negatively affected. In particular, we consider clean-label targeted attacks (in which the goal is to cause the model to misclassify a specific test point) on datasets including CIFAR-10, Imagenette, and Imagewoof. This attack is realized by constructing camouflage datapoints that mask the effect of a poisoned dataset. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning approaches are widely studied in the production prediction of CBM wells after hydraulic fracturing, but merely used in practice due to the low generalization ability and the lack of interpretability. A novel methodology is proposed in this article to discover the latent causality from observed data, which is aimed at finding an indirect way to interpret the machine learning results. Based on the theory of causal discovery, a causal graph is derived with explicit input, output, treatment and confounding variables. Then, SHAP is employed to analyze the influence of the factors on the production capability, which indirectly interprets the machine learning models. The proposed method can capture the underlying nonlinear relationship between the factors and the output, which remedies the limitation of the traditional machine learning routines based on the correlation analysis of factors. The experiment on the data of CBM shows that the detected relationship between the production and the geological/engineering factors by the presented method, is coincident with the actual physical mechanism. Meanwhile, compared with traditional methods, the interpretable machine learning models have better performance in forecasting production capability, averaging 20% improvement in accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Medical Visual Question Answering (Medical-VQA) aims to answer clinical questions regarding radiology images, assisting doctors with decision-making options. Nevertheless, current Medical-VQA models learn cross-modal representations through residing vision and texture encoders in dual separate spaces, which lead to indirect semantic alignment. In this paper, we propose UnICLAM, a Unified and Interpretable Medical-VQA model through Contrastive Representation Learning with Adversarial Masking. Specifically, to learn an aligned image-text representation, we first establish a unified dual-stream pre-training structure with the gradually soft-parameter sharing strategy. Technically, the proposed strategy learns a constraint for the vision and texture encoders to be close in a same space, which is gradually loosened as the higher number of layers. Moreover, for grasping the semantic representation, we extend the unified Adversarial Masking data augmentation strategy to the contrastive representation learning of vision and text in a unified manner, alleviating the meaningless of the commonly used random mask. Concretely, while the encoder training minimizes the distance between the original feature and the masking feature, the adversarial masking model keeps adversarial learning to conversely maximize the distance. Furthermore, we also intuitively take a further exploration of the unified adversarial masking strategy, which improves the potential ante-hoc interpretability with remarkable performance and efficiency. Experimental results on VQA-RAD and SLAKE public benchmarks demonstrate that UnICLAM outperforms the existing 11 state-of-the-art Medical-VQA models. More importantly, we make an additional discussion about the performance of UnICLAM in diagnosing heart failure, verifying that UnICLAM exhibits superior few-shot adaption performance in practical disease diagnosis.

Intuitively, credible users are more likely to share trustworthy news, while untrusted users have a higher probability of spreading untrustworthy news. In this paper, we construct a dual-layer graph (i.e., the news layer and the user layer) to extract multiple relations of news and users in social networks to derive rich information for detecting fake news. Based on the dual-layer graph, we propose a fake news detection model named Us-DeFake. It learns the propagation features of news in the news layer and the interaction features of users in the user layer. Through the inter-layer in the graph, Us-DeFake fuses the user signals that contain credibility information into the news features, to provide distinctive user-aware embeddings of news for fake news detection. The training process conducts on multiple dual-layer subgraphs obtained by a graph sampler to scale Us-DeFake in large scale social networks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets illustrate the superiority of Us-DeFake which outperforms all baselines, and the users' credibility signals learned by interaction relation can notably improve the performance of our model.

While drug repositioning can omit various R&D processes, confirming pharmacological effects on biomolecules is essential for application to new diseases. Biomedical explainability in a drug repositioning model can support appropriate insights in subsequent in-depth studies. However, the validity of the XAI methodology is still under debate, and the effectiveness of XAI in drug repositioning prediction applications remains unclear. In this study, we propose GraphIX, an explainable drug repositioning framework using biological networks, and quantitatively evaluate its explainability. GraphIX first learns the network weights and node features using a graph neural network from known drug indication and knowledge graph that consists of three types of nodes (but not given node type information): disease, drug, and protein. Analysis of the post-learning features showed that node types that were not known to the model beforehand are distinguished through the learning process based on the graph structure. From the learned weights and features, GraphIX then predicts the disease-drug association and calculates the contribution values of the nodes located in the neighborhood of the predicted disease and drug. We hypothesized that the neighboring protein node to which the model gave a high contribution is important in understanding the actual pharmacological effects. Quantitative evaluation of the validity of protein nodes' contribution using a real-world database showed that the high contribution proteins shown by GraphIX are reasonable as a mechanism of drug action. GraphIX is a framework for evidence-based drug discovery that can present to users new disease-drug associations and identify the protein important for understanding its pharmacological effects from a large and complex knowledge base.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there have been abundant researches focused on indoor human presence detection based on laborious supervised learning (SL) and channel state information (CSI). These existing studies adopt spatial information of CSI to improve detection accuracy. However, channel is susceptible to arbitrary environmental changes in practice, such as the object movement, atmospheric factors and machine rebooting, which leads to degraded prediction accuracy. However, the existing SL-based methods require to re-train a new model with time-consuming labeling. Therefore, designing a semi-supervised learning (SSL) based scheme by continuously monitoring model \"life-cycle\" becomes compellingly imperative. In this paper, we propose bifold teacher-student (BTS) learning for presence detection system, which combines SSL by utilizing partial labeled and unlabeled dataset. The proposed primal-dual teacher-student network is capable of intelligently learning spatial and temporal features from labeled and unlabeled CSI. Additionally, the enhanced penalized loss function leveraging entropy and distance measure can distinguish the drifted data, i.e., features of new dataset are affected by time-varying effect and are alternated from the original distribution. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BTS system can sustain the asymptotic accuracy after retraining the model with unlabeled data. Moreover, label-free BTS outperforms the existing SSL-based models in terms of the highest detection accuracy, while achieving the similar performance of SL-based methods. ",

Though effective for various tasks, in this paper, we show that they are potentially a problematic factor underlying all GNN models for learning on certain datasets, as they force the node representations similar, making the nodes gradually lose their identity and become indistinguishable. Hence, we augment the aggregation operations with their dual, i.e. diversification operators that make the node more distinct and preserve the identity. Such augmentation replaces the aggregation with a two-channel filtering process that, in theory, is beneficial for enriching the node representations. In practice, the proposed two-channel filters can be easily patched on existing GNN methods with diverse training strategies, including spectral and spatial (message passing) methods. In the experiments, we observe desired characteristics of the models and significant performance boost upon the baselines on 9 node classification tasks. ",

Most ML training processes, however, are designed to deliver ML tools with good average performance, but do not offer any guarantees about their worst-case estimation error. For safety-critical systems such as power systems, this places a major barrier for their adoption. So far, approaches could determine the worst-case violations of only trained ML algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to introduce a neural network training procedure designed to achieve both a good average performance and minimum worst-case violations. Using the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem as a guiding application, our approach (i) introduces a framework that reduces the worst-case generation constraint violations during training, incorporating them as a differentiable optimization layer; and (ii) presents a neural network sequential learning architecture to significantly accelerate it. We demonstrate the proposed architecture on four different test systems ranging from 39 buses to 162 buses, for both AC-OPF and DC-OPF applications. ",

    "abstract": "Community detection in Social Networks is associated with finding and grouping the most similar nodes inherent in the network. These similar nodes are identified by computing tie strength. Stronger ties indicates higher proximity shared by connected node pairs. This work is motivated by Granovetter's argument that suggests that strong ties lies within densely connected nodes and the theory that community cores in real-world networks are densely connected. In this paper, we have introduced a novel method called \\emph{Disjoint Community detection using Cascades (DCC)} which demonstrates the effectiveness of a new local density based tie strength measure on detecting communities. Here, tie strength is utilized to decide the paths followed for propagating information. The idea is to crawl through the tuple information of cascades towards the community core guided by increasing tie strength. Considering the cascade generation step, a novel preferential membership method has been developed to assign community labels to unassigned nodes. The efficacy of $DCC$ has been analyzed based on quality and accuracy on several real-world datasets and baseline community detection algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "Obtaining ground truth data in medical imaging has difficulties due to the fact that it requires a lot of annotating time from the experts in the field. Also, when trained with supervised learning, it detects only the cases included in the labels. In real practice, we want to also open to other possibilities than the named cases while examining the medical images. As a solution, the need for anomaly detection that can detect and localize abnormalities by learning the normal characteristics using only normal images is emerging. With medical image data, we can design either 2D or 3D networks of self-supervised learning for anomaly detection task. Although 3D networks, which learns 3D structures of the human body, show good performance in 3D medical image anomaly detection, they cannot be stacked in deeper layers due to memory problems. While 2D networks have advantage in feature detection, they lack 3D context information. In this paper, we develop a method for combining the strength of the 3D network and the strength of the 2D network through joint embedding. We also propose the pretask of self-supervised learning to make it possible for the networks to learn efficiently. Through the experiments, we show that the proposed method achieves better performance in both classification and segmentation tasks compared to the SoTA method. ",

    "abstract": "Recent neural radiance field (NeRF) representation has achieved great success in the tasks of novel view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. However, they suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem when continuously learning from streaming data without revisiting the previous training data. This limitation prohibits the application of existing NeRF models to scenarios where images come in sequentially. In view of this, we explore the task of incremental learning for neural radiance field representation in this work. We first propose a student-teacher pipeline to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem. Specifically, we iterate the process of using the student as the teacher at the end of each incremental step and let the teacher guide the training of the student in the next step. In this way, the student network is able to learn new information from the streaming data and retain old knowledge from the teacher network simultaneously. Given that not all information from the teacher network is helpful since it is only trained with the old data, we further introduce a random inquirer and an uncertainty-based filter to filter useful information. We conduct experiments on the NeRF-synthetic360 and NeRF-real360 datasets, where our approach significantly outperforms the baselines by 7.3% and 25.2% in terms of PSNR. Furthermore, we also show that our approach can be applied to the large-scale camera facing-outwards dataset ScanNet, where we surpass the baseline by 60.0% in PSNR. ",

We rely on the extraction of both high-level and low-level traces through a transformer-based fusion architecture that combines the RGB image and a learned noise-sensitive fingerprint. The latter learns to embed the artifacts related to the camera internal and external processing by training only on real data in a self-supervised manner. Forgeries are detected as deviations from the expected regular pattern that characterizes each pristine image. Looking for anomalies makes the approach able to robustly detect a variety of local manipulations, ensuring generalization. In addition to a pixel-level localization map and a whole-image integrity score, our approach outputs a reliability map that highlights areas where localization predictions may be error-prone. This is particularly important in forensic applications in order to reduce false alarms and allow for a large scale analysis. Extensive experiments on several datasets show that our method is able to reliably detect and localize both cheapfakes and deepfakes manipulations outperforming state-of-the-art works.

Though there are some existing connection strength measures, the density that a connection shares with it's neighbors and the directionality aspect has not received much attention. In this paper, we have proposed an asymmetric edge similarity measure namely, Neighborhood Density-based Edge Similarity (NDES) which provides a fundamental support to derive the strength of connection. The time complexity of NDES is $O(nk^2)$. An application of NDES for community detection in social network is shown. We have considered a similarity based community detection technique and substituted its similarity measure with NDES. The performance of NDES is evaluated on several small real-world datasets in terms of the effectiveness in detecting communities and compared with three widely used similarity measures. Empirical results show NDES enables detecting comparatively better communities both in terms of accuracy and quality. ",

The framework combines geostatistical pre- and post-processing tools with specialised Partial Differential Equations solvers. Random fields, for permeability and other physical properties, are generated by means of continuous or thresholded Gaussian random fields with various covariance/variogram functions. The generation process is based on an explicit spectral Fourier decomposition of the field which, although more computationally intensive than Fast Fourier Transform methods, allows a more flexible choice of statistical parameters and can be used for general geometries and grids. Flow and transport equations are solved for single-phase and variable density problems, with and without the Boussinesq approximation, and for a wide range of density, viscosity, and dispersion models, including dual-continuum (dual permeability or dual porosity) formulations. The mathematical models are here presented in details and the numerical strategies to deal with heterogeneities, equation coupling, and boundary conditions are discussed and benchmarked for the heterogeneous Henry and Horton-Rodgers-Lapwood problems, and other test cases. We show that our framework is capable of dealing with large permeability variances, viscous instabilities, and large-scale three-dimensional transport problems. ",

    "abstract": "Efforts to improve the adversarial robustness of convolutional neural networks have primarily focused on developing more effective adversarial training methods. In contrast, little attention was devoted to analyzing the role of architectural elements (such as topology, depth, and width) on adversarial robustness. This paper seeks to bridge this gap and present a holistic study on the impact of architectural design on adversarial robustness. We focus on residual networks and consider architecture design at the block level, i.e., topology, kernel size, activation, and normalization, as well as at the network scaling level, i.e., depth and width of each block in the network. In both cases, we first derive insights through systematic ablative experiments. Then we design a robust residual block, dubbed RobustResBlock, and a compound scaling rule, dubbed RobustScaling, to distribute depth and width at the desired FLOP count. Finally, we combine RobustResBlock and RobustScaling and present a portfolio of adversarially robust residual networks, RobustResNets, spanning a broad spectrum of model capacities. Experimental validation across multiple datasets and adversarial attacks demonstrate that RobustResNets consistently outperform both the standard WRNs and other existing robust architectures, achieving state-of-the-art AutoAttack robust accuracy of 61.1% without additional data and 63.7% with 500K external data while being $2\\times$ more compact in terms of parameters.

This involves training an object detection model from scratch, or fine tuning a model that is pre-trained on benchmark computer vision datasets. This approach works well with a large number of insulator images, but can result in unreliable models in the low data regime. The current literature mainly focuses on detecting the presence or absence of insulator caps, which is a relatively easy detection task, and does not consider detection of finer faults such as flashed and broken disks. In this article, we formulate three object detection tasks for insulator and asset inspection from aerial images, focusing on incipient faults in disks. We curate a large reference dataset of insulator images that can be used to learn robust features for detecting healthy and faulty insulators. We study the advantage of using this dataset in the low target data regime by pre-training on the reference dataset followed by fine-tuning on the target dataset. The results suggest that object detection models can be used to detect faults in insulators at a much incipient stage, and that transfer learning adds value depending on the type of object detection model. We identify key factors that dictate performance in the low data-regime and outline potential approaches to improve the state-of-the-art. ",

Even using the method by logical inference with a clear thinking process, the system that automatically generates any programs has not yet been realized. Especially, the inductive inference generalized by logical inference from one example is an important issue that the artificial intelligence can acquire knowledge by itself. In this study, we propose NP4G: Network Programming for Generalization, which can automatically generate programs by inductive inference.

As an example, we automatically construct a bitwise NOT operation program from several training data by generalization using NP4G. Although NP4G only randomly selects and connects nodes, by adjusting the number of nodes and the number of phase of \"Phased Learning\", we show the bitwise NOT operation programs are acquired in a comparatively short time and at a rate of about 7 in 10 running.

    "abstract": "Finding the mounting angle of a smartphone inside a car is crucial for navigation, motion detection, activity recognition, and other applications. It is a challenging task in several aspects: (i) the mounting angle at the drive start is unknown and may differ significantly between users; (ii) the user, or bad fixture, may change the mounting angle while driving; (iii) a rapid and computationally efficient real-time solution is required for most applications. To tackle these problems, a data-driven approach using deep neural networks (DNNs) is presented to learn the yaw mounting angle of a smartphone equipped with an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and strapped to a car. The proposed model, MountNet, uses only IMU readings as input and, in contrast to existing solutions, does not require inputs from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). IMU data is collected for training and validation with the sensor mounted at a known yaw mounting angle and a range of ground truth labels is generated by applying a prescribed rotation to the measurements. Although the training data did not include recordings with real sensor rotations, tests on data with real and synthetic rotations show similar results. An algorithm is formulated for real-time deployment to detect and smooth transitions in device mounting angle estimated by MountNet. MountNet is shown to find the mounting angle rapidly which is critical in real-time applications. Our method converges in less than 30 seconds of driving to a mean error of 4 degrees allowing a fast calibration phase for other algorithms and applications. When the device is rotated in the middle of a drive, large changes converge in 5 seconds and small changes converge in less than 30 seconds. ",

Additionally to the separate analysis of the two data sources, we also discuss the implications from triangulating the results. ",

    "abstract": "Electroplated diamond abrasive tools require nickel coating on a metal surface for abrasive bonding and part functionality. The electroplated nickel-coated abrasive tool is expected to have a high-quality part performance by having a nickel coating thickness of between 50% to 60% of the abrasive median diameter, uniformity of the nickel layer, abrasive distribution over the electroplated surface, and bright gloss. Electroplating parameters are set accordingly for this purpose. Industrial quality inspection for defects of these abrasive electroplated parts with optical inspection instruments is extremely challenging due to the diamond's light refraction, dispersion nature, and reflective bright nickel surface. The difficulty posed by this challenge requires parts to be quality inspected manually with an eye loupe that is subjective and costly. In this study, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model in the production line to detect abrasive electroplated part anomalies allowing us to fix or eliminate those parts or elements that are in bad condition from the production chain and ultimately reduce manual quality inspection cost. We used 744 samples to train our model. Our model successfully identified over 99% of the parts with an anomaly.

    "abstract": "Deep learning has become a promising programming paradigm in software development, owing to its surprising performance in solving many challenging tasks. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being deployed in practice, but are limited on resource-constrained devices owing to their demand for computational power. Quantization has emerged as a promising technique to reduce the size of DNNs with comparable accuracy as their floating-point numbered counterparts. The resulting quantized neural networks (QNNs) can be implemented energy-efficiently. Similar to their floating-point numbered counterparts, quality assurance techniques for QNNs, such as testing and formal verification, are essential but are currently less explored. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient formal verification approach for QNNs. In particular, we are the first to propose an encoding that reduces the verification problem of QNNs into the solving of integer linear constraints, which can be solved using off-the-shelf solvers. Our encoding is both sound and complete. We demonstrate the application of our approach on local robustness verification and maximum robustness radius computation. We implement our approach in a prototype tool QVIP and conduct a thorough evaluation. Experimental results on QNNs with different quantization bits confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, e.g., two orders of magnitude faster and able to solve more verification tasks in the same time limit than the state-of-the-art methods.

Unfortunately, the burden of finding the optimal solution for the network updating process in each given time interval is high since the computation complexity of optimization approaches using linear programming increases significantly as the size of the network increases. In this paper, we use deep reinforcement learning to derive a data-driven algorithm that does the path selection in the network considering the overhead of route computation and path updates. Our proposed scheme leverages information about past network behavior to identify a set of robust paths to be used for multiple future time intervals to avoid the overhead of updating the forwarding behavior of routers frequently. We compare the results of our approach to other traffic engineering solutions through extensive simulations across real network topologies. Our results demonstrate that our scheme fares well by a factor of 40% with respect to reducing link utilization compared to traditional TE schemes such as ECMP. Our scheme provides a slightly higher link utilization (around 25%) compared to schemes that only minimize link utilization and do not care about path updating overhead. ",

Since the behaviour of CPSs is inevitably subject to uncertainties and approximations, we show how the unique features of RobTL allow us to specify property of robustness of systems against perturbations, i.e., their capability to function correctly even under the effect of perturbations. Given the probabilistic nature of CPSs, our model checking algorithm for RobTL specifications is based on statistical inference. As an example of an application of our framework, we consider a supervised, self-coordinating engine system that is subject to attacks aimed at inflicting overstress of equipment. ",

    "abstract": "Automotive radar sensors provide valuable information for advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS). Radars can reliably estimate the distance to an object and the relative velocity, regardless of weather and light conditions. However, radar sensors suffer from low resolution and huge intra-class variations in the shape of objects. Exploiting the time information (e.g., multiple frames) has been shown to help to capture better the dynamics of objects and, therefore, the variation in the shape of objects. Most temporal radar object detectors use 3D convolutions to learn spatial and temporal information. However, these methods are often non-causal and unsuitable for real-time applications. This work presents RECORD, a new recurrent CNN architecture for online radar object detection. We propose an end-to-end trainable architecture mixing convolutions and ConvLSTMs to learn spatio-temporal dependencies between successive frames. Our model is causal and requires only the past information encoded in the memory of the ConvLSTMs to detect objects. Our experiments show such a method's relevance for detecting objects in different radar representations (range-Doppler, range-angle) and outperform state-of-the-art models on the ROD2021 and CARRADA datasets while being less computationally expensive.

Most successful approaches are based on Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) and use different views of an instance as positives that should be contrasted with other instances, called negatives, that are considered as noise. However, several instances in a dataset are drawn from the same distribution and share underlying semantic information. A good data representation should contain relations between the instances, or semantic similarity and dissimilarity, that contrastive learning harms by considering all negatives as noise. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel formulation of contrastive learning using semantic similarity between instances called Similarity Contrastive Estimation (SCE). Our training objective is a soft contrastive one that brings the positives closer and estimates a continuous distribution to push or pull negative instances based on their learned similarities. We validate empirically our approach on both image and video representation learning. We show that SCE performs competitively with the state of the art on the ImageNet linear evaluation protocol for fewer pretraining epochs and that it generalizes to several downstream image tasks. We also show that SCE reaches state-of-the-art results for pretraining video representation and that the learned representation can generalize to video downstream tasks. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a game theoretic framework for participation and free-riding in federated learning (FL), and determines the Nash equilibrium strategies when FL is executed over wireless links. To support spectrum sensing for NextG communications, FL is used by clients, namely spectrum sensors with limited training datasets and computation resources, to train a wireless signal classifier while preserving privacy. In FL, a client may be free-riding, i.e., it does not participate in FL model updates, if the computation and transmission cost for FL participation is high, and receives the global model (learned by other clients) without incurring a cost. However, the free-riding behavior may potentially decrease the global accuracy due to lack of contribution to global model learning. This tradeoff leads to a non-cooperative game where each client aims to individually maximize its utility as the difference between the global model accuracy and the cost of FL participation. The Nash equilibrium strategies are derived for free-riding probabilities such that no client can unilaterally increase its utility given the strategies of its opponents remain the same. The free-riding probability increases with the FL participation cost and the number of clients, and a significant optimality gap exists in Nash equilibrium with respect to the joint optimization for all clients. The optimality gap increases with the number of clients and the maximum gap is evaluated as a function of the cost. These results quantify the impact of free-riding on the resilience of FL in NextG networks and indicate operational modes for FL participation. ",

    "abstract": "This paper highlights vulnerabilities of deep learning-driven semantic communications to backdoor (Trojan) attacks. Semantic communications aims to convey a desired meaning while transferring information from a transmitter to its receiver. An encoder-decoder pair that is represented by two deep neural networks (DNNs) as part of an autoencoder is trained to reconstruct signals such as images at the receiver by transmitting latent features of small size over a limited number of channel uses. In the meantime, another DNN of a semantic task classifier at the receiver is jointly trained with the autoencoder to check the meaning conveyed to the receiver. The complex decision space of the DNNs makes semantic communications susceptible to adversarial manipulations. In a backdoor (Trojan) attack, the adversary adds triggers to a small portion of training samples and changes the label to a target label. When the transfer of images is considered, the triggers can be added to the images or equivalently to the corresponding transmitted or received signals. In test time, the adversary activates these triggers by providing poisoned samples as input to the encoder (or decoder) of semantic communications. The backdoor attack can effectively change the semantic information transferred for the poisoned input samples to a target meaning. As the performance of semantic communications improves with the signal-to-noise ratio and the number of channel uses, the success of the backdoor attack increases as well. Also, increasing the Trojan ratio in training data makes the attack more successful. In the meantime, the effect of this attack on the unpoisoned input samples remains limited. Overall, this paper shows that the backdoor attack poses a serious threat to semantic communications and presents novel design guidelines to preserve the meaning of transferred information in the presence of backdoor attacks.

Our theoretical analysis shows the counter-intuitive result that an adversary can influence sample complexity by corrupting the irrelevant features, i.e., those corresponding to zero coefficients of the regression parameter vector, which, consequently, do not affect the dependent variable. As any adversarially robust algorithm has its limitations, our theoretical analysis identifies the regimes under which the learning algorithm and adversary can dominate over each other. It helps us to analyze these fundamental limits and address critical scientific questions of which parameters (like mutual incoherence, the maximum and minimum eigenvalue of the covariance matrix, and the budget of adversarial perturbation) play a role in the high or low probability of success of the LASSO algorithm. Also, the derived sample complexity is logarithmic with respect to the size of the regression parameter vector, and our theoretical claims are validated by empirical analysis on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Class-imbalanced datasets are another prevalent phenomenon, and models trained on these become biased towards the majority classes. This becomes a critical issue with an SSL model's subpar performance. We aim to address the issue of labeling unlabeled data and also solve the model bias problem due to imbalanced datasets while achieving better accuracy. To accomplish this, we create \"artificial\" labels and train a model to have reasonable accuracy. We iteratively redistribute the classes through resampling using a distribution alignment technique. We use a variety of class imbalanced satellite image datasets: EuroSAT, UCM, and WHU-RS19. On UCM balanced dataset, our method outperforms previous methods MSMatch and FixMatch by 1.21% and 0.6%, respectively.

In this paper, we show that recent Text-to-Image (T2I) generators' ability to simulate image interventions via natural-language prompts can be leveraged to train more robust models, offering a more interpretable and controllable alternative to traditional augmentation methods. We find that a variety of prompting mechanisms are effective for producing synthetic training data sufficient to achieve state-of-the-art performance in widely-adopted domain-generalization benchmarks and reduce classifiers' dependency on spurious features.

Our algorithm uses exchanged gradients to calculate the correlations among tasks automatically, and dynamically adjusts the communication graph to connect mutually beneficial tasks and isolate those that may negatively impact each other. This algorithm improves the learning performance and leads to faster convergence compared to the case where all clients are connected to each other regardless of their correlations.

The experiment with the synthetic data illustrates that our proposed method is capable of detecting tasks that are positively and negatively correlated. Moreover, the results of the experiments with CelebA demonstrate that the proposed method may produce significantly faster training results than fully-connected networks. ",

    "title": "Anticancer Peptides Classification using Kernel Sparse Representation  Classifier",
    "abstract": "Cancer is one of the most challenging diseases because of its complexity, variability, and diversity of causes. It has been one of the major research topics over the past decades, yet it is still poorly understood. To this end, multifaceted therapeutic frameworks are indispensable. \\emph{Anticancer peptides} (ACPs) are the most promising treatment option, but their large-scale identification and synthesis require reliable prediction methods, which is still a problem. In this paper, we present an intuitive classification strategy that differs from the traditional \\emph{black box} method and is based on the well-known statistical theory of \\emph{sparse-representation classification} (SRC). Specifically, we create over-complete dictionary matrices by embedding the \\emph{composition of the K-spaced amino acid pairs} (CKSAAP). Unlike the traditional SRC frameworks, we use an efficient \\emph{matching pursuit} solver instead of the computationally expensive \\emph{basis pursuit} solver in this strategy. Furthermore, the \\emph{kernel principal component analysis} (KPCA) is employed to cope with non-linearity and dimension reduction of the feature space whereas the \\emph{synthetic minority oversampling technique} (SMOTE) is used to balance the dictionary. The proposed method is evaluated on two benchmark datasets for well-known statistical parameters and is found to outperform the existing methods. The results show the highest sensitivity with the most balanced accuracy, which might be beneficial in understanding structural and chemical aspects and developing new ACPs. The Google-Colab implementation of the proposed method is available at the author's GitHub page (\\href{https://github.com/ehtisham-Fazal/ACP-Kernel-SRC}{https://github.com/ehtisham-fazal/ACP-Kernel-SRC}).

    "abstract": "An important class of techniques for resonant anomaly detection in high energy physics builds models that can distinguish between reference and target datasets, where only the latter has appreciable signal. Such techniques, including Classification Without Labels (CWoLa) and Simulation Assisted Likelihood-free Anomaly Detection (SALAD) rely on a single reference dataset. They cannot take advantage of commonly-available multiple datasets and thus cannot fully exploit available information. In this work, we propose generalizations of CWoLa and SALAD for settings where multiple reference datasets are available, building on weak supervision techniques. We demonstrate improved performance in a number of settings with realistic and synthetic data. As an added benefit, our generalizations enable us to provide finite-sample guarantees, improving on existing asymptotic analyses. ",

Our approach is based on continuum stochastic hydrodynamic equations that are subject to shear boundary conditions on the unit periodic cell in a manner similar to the Lees-Edwards conditions of molecular dynamics. Our methods take into account consistently the microstructure elastic mechanics, fluid-structure hydrodynamic coupling, and thermal fluctuations. For practical simulations, we develop numerical methods for efficient stochastic field generation that handle the sheared generalized periodic boundary conditions. We show that our numerical methods are consistent with fluctuation dissipation balance and near-equilibrium statistical mechanics. As a demonstration in practice, we present several prototype rheological response studies. These include (i) shear thinning of a polymeric fluid, (ii) complex moduli for the oscillatory responses of a polymerized lipid vesicle, and (iii) aging under shear of a gel-like material. ",

PINN models aim to combine the knowledge of physical systems and data-driven machine learning models. This is done by training a neural network to minimize the residuals of the governing equations in sample points. In this work, our flow is governed by the Navier-Stokes equations with some approximations. There are two main novelties in this paper. First, we design our model to assume that the flow is periodic in time, which is not feasible in conventional simulation methods. Second, we evaluate the benefit of resampling the function evaluation points during training, which has a near zero computational cost and has been verified to improve the final model, especially for small batch sizes. Finally, we discuss some limitations of the approximations used in the Navier-Stokes equations regarding the modeling of turbulence and how it interacts with PINNs. ",

In this study, we analyze, two recently published Transformer-based network architectures for the task of multimodal head-and-tumor segmentation and compare their performance to the de facto standard 3D segmentation network - the nnU-Net. Our results showed that modeling long-range dependencies may be helpful in cases where large structures are present and/or large field of view is needed. However, for small structures such as head-and-neck tumor, the convolution-based U-Net architecture seemed to perform well, especially when training dataset is small and computational resource is limited.

    "abstract": "Recently, deep networks have shown impressive performance for the segmentation of cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. However, their achievement is proving slow to transition to widespread use in medical clinics because of robustness issues leading to low trust of clinicians to their results. Predicting run-time quality of segmentation masks can be useful to warn clinicians against poor results. Despite its importance, there are few studies on this problem. To address this gap, we propose a quality control method based on the agreement across decoders of a multi-view network, TMS-Net, measured by the cosine similarity. The network takes three view inputs resliced from the same 3D image along different axes. Different from previous multi-view networks, TMS-Net has a single encoder and three decoders, leading to better noise robustness, segmentation performance and run-time quality estimation in our experiments on the segmentation of the left atrium on STACOM 2013 and STACOM 2018 challenge datasets. We also present a way to generate poor segmentation masks by using noisy images generated with engineered noise and Rician noise to simulate undertraining, high anisotropy and poor imaging settings problems. Our run-time quality estimation method show a good classification of poor and good quality segmentation masks with an AUC reaching to 0.97 on STACOM 2018. We believe that TMS-Net and our run-time quality estimation method has a high potential to increase the thrust of clinicians to automatic image analysis tools. ",
