    "title": "Hope Speech Detection on Social Media Platforms",
    "abstract": "Since personal computers became widely available in the consumer market, the amount of harmful content on the internet has significantly expanded. In simple terms, harmful content is anything online which causes a person distress or harm. It may include hate speech, violent content, threats, non-hope speech, etc. The online content must be positive, uplifting and supportive. Over the past few years, many studies have focused on solving this problem through hate speech detection, but very few focused on identifying hope speech. This paper discusses various machine learning approaches to identify a sentence as Hope Speech, Non-Hope Speech, or a Neutral sentence. The dataset used in the study contains English YouTube comments and is released as a part of the shared task \"EACL-2021: Hope Speech Detection for Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion\". Initially, the dataset obtained from the shared task had three classes: Hope Speech, non-Hope speech, and not in English; however, upon deeper inspection, we discovered that dataset relabeling is required. A group of undergraduates was hired to help perform the entire dataset's relabeling task. We experimented with conventional machine learning models (such as Na\\\"ive Bayes, logistic regression and support vector machine) and pre-trained models (such as BERT) on relabeled data. According to the experimental results, the relabeled data has achieved a better accuracy for Hope speech identification than the original data set. ",

    "title": "Robust and Explainable Identification of Logical Fallacies in Natural  Language Arguments",
    "abstract": "The spread of misinformation, propaganda, and flawed argumentation has been amplified in the Internet era. Given the volume of data and the subtlety of identifying violations of argumentation norms, supporting information analytics tasks, like content moderation, with trustworthy methods that can identify logical fallacies is essential. In this paper, we formalize prior theoretical work on logical fallacies into a comprehensive three-stage evaluation framework of detection, coarse-grained, and fine-grained classification. We adapt existing evaluation datasets for each stage of the evaluation. We devise three families of robust and explainable methods based on prototype reasoning, instance-based reasoning, and knowledge injection. The methods are designed to combine language models with background knowledge and explainable mechanisms. Moreover, we address data sparsity with strategies for data augmentation and curriculum learning. Our three-stage framework natively consolidates prior datasets and methods from existing tasks, like propaganda detection, serving as an overarching evaluation testbed. We extensively evaluate these methods on our datasets, focusing on their robustness and explainability. Our results provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the methods on different components and fallacy classes, indicating that fallacy identification is a challenging task that may require specialized forms of reasoning to capture various classes. We share our open-source code and data on GitHub to support further work on logical fallacy identification. ",

Following a previously established framework, in this paper, we present the UNER dataset, a multilingual and hierarchical parallel corpus annotated for named-entities.

The three-step procedure extracts entities from Wikipedia articles, links them to DBpedia, and maps the DBpedia sets of classes to the UNER labels.

Next, bidirectional post-hoc analysis is carried out using Granger causality tests, impulse response analysis and forecast error variance decomposition, which demonstrate that the spread of debunks has a positive impact on reducing Ukraine-related disinformation eventually, albeit not instantly. Lastly, the paper investigates the dominant themes in Ukraine-related disinformation and their spatiotemporal distribution. With respect to debunks, we also establish that around 18% of fact-checks are debunking claims which have already been fact-checked in another language. The latter finding highlights an opportunity for better collaboration between fact-checkers, so they can benefit from and amplify each other's debunks through translation, citation, and early publication online.

    "abstract": "Harmonic functions are abundant in nature, appearing in limiting cases of Maxwell's, Navier-Stokes equations, the heat and the wave equation. Consequently, there are many applications of harmonic functions, spanning applications from industrial process optimisation to robotic path planning and the calculation of first exit times of random walks. Despite their ubiquity and relevance, there have been few attempts to develop effective means of representing harmonic functions in the context of machine learning architectures, either in machine learning on classical computers, or in the nascent field of quantum machine learning. Architectures which impose or encourage an inductive bias towards harmonic functions would facilitate data-driven modelling and the solution of inverse problems in a range of applications. For classical neural networks, it has already been established how leveraging inductive biases can in general lead to improved performance of learning algorithms. The introduction of such inductive biases within a quantum machine learning setting is instead still in its nascent stages. In this work, we derive exactly-harmonic (conventional- and quantum-) neural networks in two dimensions for simply-connected domains by leveraging the characteristics of holomorphic complex functions. We then demonstrate how these can be approximately extended to multiply-connected two-dimensional domains using techniques inspired by domain decomposition in physics-informed neural networks. We further provide architectures and training protocols to effectively impose approximately harmonic constraints in three dimensions and higher, and as a corollary we report divergence-free network architectures in arbitrary dimensions. Our approaches are demonstrated with applications to heat transfer, electrostatics and robot navigation, with comparisons to physics-informed neural networks included. ",

The addition of calculated small distortion to images, for instance, can deceive a well-trained image classification network. In this work, we propose a novel attack technique called Sparse Adversarial and Interpretable Attack Framework (SAIF). Specifically, we design imperceptible attacks that contain low-magnitude perturbations at a small number of pixels and leverage these sparse attacks to reveal the vulnerability of classifiers. We use the Frank-Wolfe (conditional gradient) algorithm to simultaneously optimize the attack perturbations for bounded magnitude and sparsity with $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence. Empirical results show that SAIF computes highly imperceptible and interpretable adversarial examples, and outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attack methods on the ImageNet dataset. ",

We study messages from nearly 2,500 users from two online communities (Twitter and Reddit) and find that we can measure significant personality differences between regular and harmful users from the writing style of as few as 100 tweets or 40 Reddit posts, aggregate these values to distinguish between healthy and harmful communities, and also use style attributes to predict which users will engage in harmful behaviors.

    "title": "Plastic Contaminant Detection in Aerial Imagery of Cotton Fields with  Deep Learning",
    "abstract": "Plastic shopping bags that get carried away from the side of roads and tangled on cotton plants can end up at cotton gins if not removed before the harvest. Such bags may not only cause problem in the ginning process but might also get embodied in cotton fibers reducing its quality and marketable value. Therefore, it is required to detect, locate, and remove the bags before cotton is harvested. Manually detecting and locating these bags in cotton fields is labor intensive, time-consuming and a costly process. To solve these challenges, we present application of four variants of YOLOv5 (YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l and YOLOv5x) for detecting plastic shopping bags using Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)-acquired RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) images. We also show fixed effect model tests of color of plastic bags as well as YOLOv5-variant on average precision (AP), mean average precision (mAP@50) and accuracy. In addition, we also demonstrate the effect of height of plastic bags on the detection accuracy. It was found that color of bags had significant effect (p < 0.001) on accuracy across all the four variants while it did not show any significant effect on the AP with YOLOv5m (p = 0.10) and YOLOv5x (p = 0.35) at 95% confidence level. Similarly, YOLOv5-variant did not show any significant effect on the AP (p = 0.11) and accuracy (p = 0.73) of white bags, but it had significant effects on the AP (p = 0.03) and accuracy (p = 0.02) of brown bags including on the mAP@50 (p = 0.01) and inference speed (p < 0.0001). Additionally, height of plastic bags had significant effect (p < 0.0001) on overall detection accuracy. The findings reported in this paper can be useful in speeding up removal of plastic bags from cotton fields before harvest and thereby reducing the amount of contaminants that end up at cotton gins.

    "abstract": "The policy gradient method enjoys the simplicity of the objective where the agent optimizes the cumulative reward directly. Moreover, in the continuous action domain, parameterized distribution of action distribution allows easy control of exploration, resulting from the variance of the representing distribution. Entropy can play an essential role in policy optimization by selecting the stochastic policy, which eventually helps better explore the environment in reinforcement learning (RL). However, the stochasticity often reduces as the training progresses; thus, the policy becomes less exploratory. Additionally, certain parametric distributions might only work for some environments and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. This paper aims to mitigate these issues. In particular, we propose an algorithm called Robust Policy Optimization (RPO), which leverages a perturbed distribution. We hypothesize that our method encourages high-entropy actions and provides a way to represent the action space better. We further provide empirical evidence to verify our hypothesis. We evaluated our methods on various continuous control tasks from DeepMind Control, OpenAI Gym, Pybullet, and IsaacGym. We observed that in many settings, RPO increases the policy entropy early in training and then maintains a certain level of entropy throughout the training period. Eventually, our agent RPO shows consistently improved performance compared to PPO and other techniques: entropy regularization, different distributions, and data augmentation. Furthermore, in several settings, our method stays robust in performance, while other baseline mechanisms fail to improve and even worsen the performance. ",

Health systems capture SDOH information through structured data and unstructured clinical notes; however, clinical notes often contain a more comprehensive representation of several key SDOH. The objective of this work is to assess the SDOH information gain achievable by extracting structured semantic representations of SDOH from the clinical narrative and combining these extracted representations with available structured data. Materials and Methods: We developed a natural language processing (NLP) information extraction model for SDOH that utilizes a deep learning entity and relation extraction architecture. In an electronic health record (EHR) case study, we applied the SDOH extractor to a large existing clinical data set with over 200,000 patients and 400,000 notes and compared the extracted information with available structured data. Results: The SDOH extractor achieved 0.86 F1 on a withheld test set. In the EHR case study, we found 19\\% of current tobacco users, 10\\% of drug users, and 32\\% of homeless patients only include documentation of these risk factors in the clinical narrative. Conclusions: Patients who are at-risk for negative health outcomes due to SDOH may be better served if health systems are able to identify SDOH risk factors and associated social needs. Structured semantic representations of text-encoded SDOH information can augment existing structured, and this more comprehensive SDOH representation can assist health systems in identifying and addressing social needs.

Such systems depend on the availability of both (benign and malicious) network data classes during the training phase. However, attack data samples are often challenging to collect in most organisations due to security controls preventing the penetration of known malicious traffic to their networks. Therefore, this paper proposes a Deep One-Class (DOC) classifier for network intrusion detection by only training on benign network data samples. The novel one-class classification architecture consists of a histogram-based deep feed-forward classifier to extract useful network data features and use efficient outlier detection. The DOC classifier has been extensively evaluated using two benchmark NIDS datasets.

Despite such efforts, we have yet to provide definite answers to crucial issues in evaluating predictive solutions in domains such as weather, pollution, health. In this paper, we deal with two encapsulated problems simultaneously. First, assessing the performance of regression models when non-uniform preferences apply - not all values are equally relevant concerning the accuracy of their prediction, and there's a particular interest in the most extreme values. Second, assessing the robustness of models when dealing with uncertainty regarding the actual underlying distribution of values relevant for such problems.

    "abstract": "Source-free domain adaptation aims to adapt a source model trained on fully-labeled source domain data to a target domain with unlabeled target domain data. Source data is assumed inaccessible due to proprietary or privacy reasons. Existing works use the source model to pseudolabel target data, but the pseudolabels are unreliable due to data distribution shift between source and target domain. In this work, we propose to leverage an ImageNet pre-trained feature extractor in a new co-learning framework to improve target pseudolabel quality for finetuning the source model. Benefits of the ImageNet feature extractor include that it is not source-biased and it provides an alternate view of features and classification decisions different from the source model. Such pre-trained feature extractors are also publicly available, which allows us to readily leverage modern network architectures that have strong representation learning ability. After co-learning, we sharpen predictions of non-pseudolabeled samples by entropy minimization. Evaluation on 3 benchmark datasets show that our proposed method can outperform existing source-free domain adaptation methods, as well as unsupervised domain adaptation methods which assume joint access to source and target data.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a phenomenon where query-based object detectors mispredict at the last decoding stage while predicting correctly at an intermediate stage. We review the training process and attribute the overlooked phenomenon to two limitations: lack of training emphasis and cascading errors from decoding sequence. We design and present Selective Query Recollection (SQR), a simple and effective training strategy for query-based object detectors. It cumulatively collects intermediate queries as decoding stages go deeper and selectively forwards the queries to the downstream stages aside from the sequential structure. Such-wise, SQR places training emphasis on later stages and allows later stages to work with intermediate queries from earlier stages directly. SQR can be easily plugged into various query-based object detectors and significantly enhances their performance while leaving the inference pipeline unchanged. As a result, we apply SQR on Adamixer, DAB-DETR, and Deformable-DETR across various settings (backbone, number of queries, schedule) and consistently brings 1.4-2.8 AP improvement. ",

Although subgraph enumeration and subgraph mining have been proposed to bring insights into a graph database by a set of subgraph structures, they often end up with similar or homogenous topologies, which is undesirable in many graph applications. To address this limitation, we propose the Top-k Edge-Diversified Patterns Discovery problem to retrieve a set of subgraphs that cover the maximum number of edges in a database. To efficiently process such query, we present a generic and extensible framework called Ted which achieves a guaranteed approximation ratio to the optimal result. Two optimization strategies are further developed to improve the performance. Experimental studies on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Ted to traditional techniques. ",

A transmission model with three time subslots is purposely introduced. In the first subslot, selected relay applies time-switching protocol to harvest radio frequency energy radiated by source and destination; in the remaining subslots, selected relay facilitates source and destination to exchange information. Due to finite-size data buffer and finite-size battery of relay, an optimal relay selection and power allocation policy is proposed, in order to maximize networks sum-throughput. One obstacle is the inherent non-convex property of the underlying sum-throughput optimization problem. By carefully decoupling the multiplicative variables and relaxing binary variable to a real number, we convert this problem into a convex optimization one and then Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are used to solve it. Extensive simulations have been conducted to demonstrate the improved sum-throughput with our proposed strategy. ",

    "abstract": "Adapting object detectors learned with sufficient supervision to novel classes under low data regimes is charming yet challenging. In few-shot object detection (FSOD), the two-step training paradigm is widely adopted to mitigate the severe sample imbalance, i.e., holistic pre-training on base classes, then partial fine-tuning in a balanced setting with all classes. Since unlabeled instances are suppressed as backgrounds in the base training phase, the learned RPN is prone to produce biased proposals for novel instances, resulting in dramatic performance degradation. Unfortunately, the extreme data scarcity aggravates the proposal distribution bias, hindering the RoI head from evolving toward novel classes. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective proposal distribution calibration (PDC) approach to neatly enhance the localization and classification abilities of the RoI head by recycling its localization ability endowed in base training and enriching high-quality positive samples for semantic fine-tuning. Specifically, we sample proposals based on the base proposal statistics to calibrate the distribution bias and impose additional localization and classification losses upon the sampled proposals for fast expanding the base detector to novel classes. Experiments on the commonly used Pascal VOC and MS COCO datasets with explicit state-of-the-art performances justify the efficacy of our PDC for FSOD. Code is available at github.com/Bohao-Lee/PDC.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the use of evolutionary algorithms for solving differential equations. The solution is obtained by optimizing a deep neural network whose loss function is defined by the residual terms from the differential equations. Recent studies have used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) variants to train these physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), but these methods can struggle to find accurate solutions due to optimization challenges. When solving differential equations, it is important to find the globally optimum parameters of the network, rather than just finding a solution that works well during training. SGD only searches along a single gradient direction, so it may not be the best approach for training PINNs with their accompanying complex optimization landscapes. In contrast, evolutionary algorithms perform a parallel exploration of different solutions in order to avoid getting stuck in local optima and can potentially find more accurate solutions. However, evolutionary algorithms can be slow, which can make them difficult to use in practice. To address this, we provide a set of five benchmark problems with associated performance metrics and baseline results to support the development of evolutionary algorithms for enhanced PINN training. As a baseline, we evaluate the performance and speed of using the widely adopted Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) for solving PINNs. We provide the loss and training time for CMA-ES run on TensorFlow, and CMA-ES and SGD run on JAX (with GPU acceleration) for the five benchmark problems. Our results show that JAX-accelerated evolutionary algorithms, particularly CMA-ES, can be a useful approach for solving differential equations. We hope that our work will support the exploration and development of alternative optimization algorithms for the complex task of optimizing PINNs. ",

The proposed method consists of three main components. The first component generates high-quality foreground object masks. To this end, an EM-like approach is proposed that iteratively refines an initial set of object mask proposals generated by a generic region proposal method. Next, in the second component, high-quality context-aware background images are generated using a text-to-image compositional synthesis method like DALL-E. Finally, the third component creates a large-scale pseudo-labeled instance segmentation training dataset by compositing the foreground object masks onto the original and generated background images. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art weakly-supervised instance segmentation results on both the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO datasets by using only image-level, weak label information. In particular, it outperforms the best baseline by +7.4 and +2.8 mAP0.50 on PASCAL and COCO, respectively. Further, the method provides a new solution to the long-tail weakly-supervised instance segmentation problem (when many classes may only have few training samples), by selectively augmenting under-represented classes.

However, most existing human datasets only provide multi-view human images captured under the same illumination. Although valuable for modeling tasks, they are not readily used in relighting problems. To promote research in both fields, in this paper, we present UltraStage, a new 3D human dataset that contains more than 2K high-quality human assets captured under both multi-view and multi-illumination settings. Specifically, for each example, we provide 32 surrounding views illuminated with one white light and two gradient illuminations. In addition to regular multi-view images, gradient illuminations help recover detailed surface normal and spatially-varying material maps, enabling various relighting applications. Inspired by recent advances in neural representation, we further interpret each example into a neural human asset which allows novel view synthesis under arbitrary lighting conditions. We show our neural human assets can achieve extremely high capture performance and are capable of representing fine details such as facial wrinkles and cloth folds. We also validate UltraStage in single image relighting tasks, training neural networks with virtual relighted data from neural assets and demonstrating realistic rendering improvements over prior arts. UltraStage will be publicly available to the community to stimulate significant future developments in various human modeling and rendering tasks. ",

However, most of these detectors are trained independently, making it a challenging task to associate detected body parts with people. This paper focuses on the problem of joint detection of human body and its corresponding parts. Specifically, we propose a novel extended object representation that integrates the center location offsets of body or its parts, and construct a dense single-stage anchor-based Body-Part Joint Detector (BPJDet). Body-part associations in BPJDet are embedded into the unified representation which contains both the semantic and geometric information. Therefore, BPJDet does not suffer from error-prone association post-matching, and has a better accuracy-speed trade-off. Furthermore, BPJDet can be seamlessly generalized to jointly detect any body part. To verify the effectiveness and superiority of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on the CityPersons, CrowdHuman and BodyHands datasets. The proposed BPJDet detector achieves state-of-the-art association performance on these three benchmarks while maintains high accuracy of detection.

The diversion pipeline is an enclosed space, so the airflow disturbance caused by the rotation of the UAV blades and the strong air convection from the chimney effect have a great impact on the flight control of the UAV. Although the traditional linear control PID flight control algorithm has been widely used and can meet the requirements of general flight tasks, it cannot guarantee the stability of the system over a wide range. The inspection of a diversion line in an enclosed space requires high system stability and robustness of the UAV controller. In this paper, a hybrid stabilised adaptive backstepping control method is proposed. Firstly, a multi-rotor UAV model is analysed and transformed into a strict feedback form with external disturbances; then adaptive techniques are used to estimate the airflow disturbances caused by the blades, and the attitude and position tracking controllers are designed by combining backstepping control and PID control respectively; finally, the asymptotic stability of the system is ensured by constructing a Lyapunov function. The experimental data show that the flight controller designed in this paper has good robustness and tracking performance, and can better resist the disturbance caused by airflow disturbance in confined space.

    "abstract": "Tomorrow's massive-scale IoT sensor networks are poised to drive uplink traffic demand, especially in areas of dense deployment. To meet this demand, however, network designers leverage tools that often require accurate estimates of Channel State Information (CSI), which incurs a high overhead and thus reduces network throughput. Furthermore, the overhead generally scales with the number of clients, and so is of special concern in such massive IoT sensor networks. While prior work has used transmissions over one frequency band to predict the channel of another frequency band on the same link, this paper takes the next step in the effort to reduce CSI overhead: predict the CSI of a nearby but distinct link. We propose Cross-Link Channel Prediction (CLCP), a technique that leverages multi-view representation learning to predict the channel response of a large number of users, thereby reducing channel estimation overhead further than previously possible. CLCP's design is highly practical, exploiting channel estimates obtained from existing transmissions instead of dedicated channel sounding or extra pilot signals. We have implemented CLCP for two different Wi-Fi versions, namely 802.11n and 802.11ax, the latter being the leading candidate for future IoT networks. We evaluate CLCP in two large-scale indoor scenarios involving both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight transmissions with up to 144 different 802.11ax users. Moreover, we measure its performance with four different channel bandwidths, from 20 MHz up to 160 MHz. Our results show that CLCP provides a 2x throughput gain over baseline 802.11ax and a 30 percent throughput gain over existing cross-band prediction algorithms. ",

Optimal well-control scheme for effective heat extraction and improved heat sweep efficiency plays a significant role in geothermal development. However, the optimization performance of most existing optimization algorithms deteriorates as dimension increases. To solve this issue, a novel surrogate-assisted level-based learning evolutionary search algorithm (SLLES) is proposed for heat extraction optimization of enhanced geothermal system. SLLES consists of classifier-assisted level-based learning pre-screen part and local evolutionary search part. The cooperation of the two parts has realized the balance between the exploration and exploitation during the optimization process. After iteratively sampling from the design space, the robustness and effectiveness of the algorithm are proven to be improved significantly. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithm holds state-of-the-art simulation-involved optimization framework. Comparative experiments have been conducted on benchmark functions, a two-dimensional fractured reservoir and a three-dimensional enhanced geothermal system. The proposed algorithm outperforms other five state-of-the-art surrogate-assisted algorithms on all selected benchmark functions. The results on the two heat extraction cases also demonstrate that SLLES can achieve superior optimization performance compared with traditional evolutionary algorithm and other surrogate-assisted algorithms. This work lays a solid basis for efficient geothermal extraction of enhanced geothermal system and sheds light on the model management strategies of data-driven optimization in the areas of energy exploitation.

This leads to a classification-based rule for opinion update. Second, we consider three complementary agent traits suggested by significant sociological and psychological research: conformism, radicalism and stubbornness. We rely on World Values Survey data to show that the proposed model has the potential to predict the evolution of opinions in real life: the classification-based approach and complementary agent traits produce rich collective behaviours, such as polarisation, consensus, and clustering, which can yield predicted opinions similar to survey results.

    "abstract": "The identification of material parameters occurring in constitutive models has a wide range of applications in practice. One of these applications is the monitoring and assessment of the actual condition of infrastructure buildings, as the material parameters directly reflect the resistance of the structures to external impacts. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a suitable method for solving inverse problems. The advantages of this method are a straightforward inclusion of observation data. Unlike grid-based methods, such as the finite element method updating (FEMU) approach, no computational grid and no interpolation of the data is required. In the current work, we aim to further develop PINNs towards the calibration of the linear-elastic constitutive model from full-field displacement and global force data in a realistic regime. We show that normalization and conditioning of the optimization problem play a crucial role in this process. Therefore, among others, we identify the material parameters for initial estimates and balance the individual terms in the loss function. In order to reduce the dependence of the identified material parameters on local errors in the displacement approximation, we base the identification not on the stress boundary conditions but instead on the global balance of internal and external work. In addition, we found that we get a better posed inverse problem if we reformulate it in terms of bulk and shear modulus instead of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. We demonstrate that the enhanced PINNs are capable of identifying material parameters from both experimental one-dimensional data and synthetic full-field displacement data in a realistic regime. Since displacement data measured by, e.g., a digital image correlation (DIC) system is noisy, we additionally investigate the robustness of the method to different levels of noise. ",

Despite their relative importance in making safer driving decisions, these devices are vulnerable to multiple attack types including spoofing, triggering and false data injection. When these attacks are successful they can compromise the security of autonomous vehicles leading to severe consequences for the driver, nearby vehicles and pedestrians. To handle these attacks and protect the measurement devices, we propose a spatial-temporal anomaly detection model \\textit{STAnDS} which incorporates a residual error spatial detector, with a time-based expected change detection. This approach is evaluated using a simulated quantitative environment and the results show that \\textit{STAnDS} is effective at detecting multiple attack types. ",

They are complementary to feature points thanks to their spatial extent and the structural information they provide. Traditional line detectors based on the image gradient are extremely fast and accurate, but lack robustness in noisy images and challenging conditions. Their learned counterparts are more repeatable and can handle challenging images, but at the cost of a lower accuracy and a bias towards wireframe lines. We propose to combine traditional and learned approaches to get the best of both worlds: an accurate and robust line detector that can be trained in the wild without ground truth lines. Our new line segment detector, DeepLSD, processes images with a deep network to generate a line attraction field, before converting it to a surrogate image gradient magnitude and angle, which is then fed to any existing handcrafted line detector. Additionally, we propose a new optimization tool to refine line segments based on the attraction field and vanishing points. This refinement improves the accuracy of current deep detectors by a large margin. We demonstrate the performance of our method on low-level line detection metrics, as well as on several downstream tasks using multiple challenging datasets.

Besides, they still need support in efficiently capturing user preferences since the information reflected in a single conversation is limited. Inspired by collaborative filtering, we propose a collaborative augmentation (COLA) method to simultaneously improve both item representation learning and user preference modeling to address these issues. We construct an interactive user-item graph from all conversations, which augments item representations with user-aware information, i.e., item popularity. To improve user preference modeling, we retrieve similar conversations from the training corpus, where the involved items and attributes that reflect the user's potential interests are used to augment the user representation through gate control.

This paper investigates the application of conformal prediction as a general framework to obtain AI models that produce decisions with formal calibration guarantees. Conformal prediction transforms probabilistic predictors into set predictors that are guaranteed to contain the correct answer with a probability chosen by the designer. Such formal calibration guarantees hold irrespective of the true, unknown, distribution underlying the generation of the variables of interest, and can be defined in terms of ensemble or time-averaged probabilities. In this paper, conformal prediction is applied for the first time to the design of AI for communication systems in conjunction to both frequentist and Bayesian learning, focusing on demodulation, modulation classification, and channel prediction.

We adopt three knowledge-driven approaches for zero-shot QA over traffic situations, based on prior natural language inference methods, commonsense models with knowledge graph self-supervision, and dense retriever-based models. We constructed two text-based multiple-choice question answering sets: BDD-QA for evaluating causal reasoning in the traffic domain and HDT-QA for measuring the possession of domain knowledge akin to human driving license tests. Among the methods, Unified-QA reaches the best performance on the BDD-QA dataset with the adaptation of multiple formats of question answers. Language models trained with inference information and commonsense knowledge are also good at predicting the cause and effect in the traffic domain but perform badly at answering human-driving QA sets.

Insurance is majorly divided into two categories: (i) Life and (ii) Non-life. Non-life insurance in turn includes health insurance and auto insurance among other things. In either of the categories, the fraud detection techniques should be designed in such a way that they capture as many fraudulent transactions as possible. Owing to the rarity of fraudulent transactions, in this paper, we propose a chaotic variational autoencoder (C-VAE to perform one-class classification (OCC) on genuine transactions. Here, we employed the logistic chaotic map to generate random noise in the latent space. The effectiveness of C-VAE is demonstrated on the health insurance fraud and auto insurance datasets. We considered vanilla Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) as the baseline. It is observed that C-VAE outperformed VAE in both datasets. C-VAE achieved a classification rate of 77.9% and 87.25% in health and automobile insurance datasets respectively. Further, the t-test conducted at 1% level of significance and 18 degrees of freedom infers that C-VAE is statistically significant than the VAE. ",

    "abstract": "Despite their excellent performance, state-of-the-art computer vision models often fail when they encounter adversarial examples. Video perception models tend to be more fragile under attacks, because the adversary has more places to manipulate in high-dimensional data. In this paper, we find one reason for video models' vulnerability is that they fail to perceive the correct motion under adversarial perturbations. Inspired by the extensive evidence that motion is a key factor for the human visual system, we propose to correct what the model sees by restoring the perceived motion information. Since motion information is an intrinsic structure of the video data, recovering motion signals can be done at inference time without any human annotation, which allows the model to adapt to unforeseen, worst-case inputs. Visualizations and empirical experiments on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets show that restoring motion information in deep vision models improves adversarial robustness. Even under adaptive attacks where the adversary knows our defense, our algorithm is still effective. Our work provides new insight into robust video perception algorithms by using intrinsic structures from the data. Our webpage is available at https://motion4robust.cs.columbia.edu. ",

Both methods benefit when compression parameters are selected specifically for each layer. Finding good combinations of compression parameters, so-called compression policies, is hard as the problem spans an exponentially large search space. Effective compression policies consider the influence of the specific hardware architecture on the used compression methods. We propose an algorithmic framework called Galen to search such policies using reinforcement learning utilizing pruning and quantization, thus providing automatic compression for neural networks. Contrary to other approaches we use inference latency measured on the target hardware device as an optimization goal. With that, the framework supports the compression of models specific to a given hardware target. We validate our approach using three different reinforcement learning agents for pruning, quantization and joint pruning and quantization. Besides proving the functionality of our approach we were able to compress a ResNet18 for CIFAR-10, on an embedded ARM processor, to 20% of the original inference latency without significant loss of accuracy. Moreover, we can demonstrate that a joint search and compression using pruning and quantization is superior to an individual search for policies using a single compression method. ",

Widely applied models are currently rule-based and can struggle to reproduce structural dynamics. Lead by recent developments in Graph Neural Network (GNN) models for network generation we evaluate the potential of GNNs for synthetic social networks. Our GNN use is specifically within a reasonable use-case and includes empirical evaluation using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We include social network specific measurements which allow evaluation of how realistically synthetic networks behave in typical social network analysis applications. We find that the Gated Recurrent Attention Network (GRAN) extends well to social networks, and in comparison to a benchmark popular rule-based generation Recursive-MATrix (R-MAT) method, is better able to replicate realistic structural dynamics. We find that GRAN is more computationally costly than R-MAT, but is not excessively costly to employ, so would be effective for researchers seeking to create datasets of synthetic social networks. ",

We use contextual and non-contextual embeddings that are trained on domain-independent as well as clinical domain-specific data.

We show that executing IR code such as WASM bytecode on a runtime executing in a TEE leaks most IR instructions with high accuracy and therefore reveals the confidential code. Contrary to IR execution, native execution is much less susceptible to leakage and largely resists even the most powerful side-channel attacks. We evaluate native execution leakage in Intel SGX and AMD SEV and experimentally demonstrate end-to-end instruction extraction on Intel SGX, with WASM bytecode as IR executed within WAMR, a hybrid between a JIT compiler and interpreter developed by Intel. Our experiments show that IR code leakage from such systems is practical and therefore question the security claims of several commercial solutions which rely on TEEs+WASM for code confidentiality.

However, the sparse availability of such documents poses a challenge in obtaining robust systems. Hence, the research of this article explores the influence of data augmentation on the dating of historical manuscripts. Linear Support Vector Machines were trained with k-fold cross-validation on textural and grapheme-based features extracted from historical manuscripts of different collections, including the Medieval Paleographical Scale, early Aramaic manuscripts, and the Dead Sea Scrolls. Results show that training models with augmented data improve the performance of historical manuscripts dating by 1% - 3% in cumulative scores.

    "abstract": "Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) describes a process for inferring quantifiable metrics of structural condition, which can serve as input to support decisions on the operation and maintenance of infrastructure assets. Given the long lifespan of critical structures, this problem can be cast as a sequential decision making problem over prescribed horizons. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) offer a formal framework to solve the underlying optimal planning task. However, two issues can undermine the POMDP solutions. Firstly, the need for a model that can adequately describe the evolution of the structural condition under deterioration or corrective actions and, secondly, the non-trivial task of recovery of the observation process parameters from available monitoring data. Despite these potential challenges, the adopted POMDP models do not typically account for uncertainty on model parameters, leading to solutions which can be unrealistically confident. In this work, we address both key issues. We present a framework to estimate POMDP transition and observation model parameters directly from available data, via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) conditioned on actions. The MCMC inference estimates distributions of the involved model parameters. We then form and solve the POMDP problem by exploiting the inferred distributions, to derive solutions that are robust to model uncertainty. We successfully apply our approach on maintenance planning for railway track assets on the basis of a \"fractal value\" indicator, which is computed from actual railway monitoring data. ",

Although these strategies showed impressive results, they still have some limitations in utilizing language information. First, most approaches only use graph networks to utilize syntactic and semantic information without considering linguistic features. Second, most previous works do not explicitly consider adjacent words when encoding syntactic and semantic information, even though it is obvious that adjacent words are usually meaningful when encoding the current word.

However, existing human evaluation protocols and benchmarks for summarization either exhibit low inter-annotator agreement or lack the scale needed to draw statistically significant conclusions, and an in-depth analysis of human evaluation is lacking. In this work, we address the shortcomings of existing summarization evaluation along the following axes: 1) We propose a modified summarization salience protocol, Atomic Content Units (ACUs), which relies on fine-grained semantic units and allows for high inter-annotator agreement. 2) We curate the Robust Summarization Evaluation (RoSE) benchmark, a large human evaluation dataset consisting of over 22k summary-level annotations over state-of-the-art systems on three datasets. 3) We compare our ACU protocol with three other human evaluation protocols, underscoring potential confounding factors in evaluation setups. 4) We evaluate existing automatic metrics using the collected human annotations across evaluation protocols and demonstrate how our benchmark leads to more statistically stable and significant results. Furthermore, our findings have important implications for evaluating large language models (LLMs), as we show that LLMs adjusted by human feedback (e.g., GPT-3.5) may overfit unconstrained human evaluation, which is affected by the annotators' prior, input-agnostic preferences, calling for more robust, targeted evaluation methods.

Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) is one of the most effective and conceptually simple algorithms to generate such adversaries. The search space of PGD is dictated by the steepest ascent directions of an objective. Despite the plethora of objective function choices, there is no universally superior option and robustness overestimation may arise from ill-suited objective selection. Driven by this observation, we postulate that the combination of different objectives through a simple loss alternating scheme renders PGD more robust towards design choices. We experimentally verify this assertion on a synthetic-data example and by evaluating our proposed method across 25 different $\\ell_{\\infty}$-robust models and 3 datasets. The performance improvement is consistent, when compared to the single loss counterparts. In the CIFAR-10 dataset, our strongest adversarial attack outperforms all of the white-box components of AutoAttack (AA) ensemble, as well as the most powerful attacks existing on the literature, achieving state-of-the-art results in the computational budget of our study ($T=100$, no restarts).

IoT is the network of real-time devices like home automation systems and can be controlled by open-source android devices, which can be an open ground for attackers. Attackers can access the network, initiate a different kind of security breach, and compromises network control. Therefore, timely detecting the increasing number of sophisticated malware attacks is the challenge to ensure the credibility of network protection. In this regard, we have developed a new malware detection framework, Deep Squeezed-Boosted and Ensemble Learning (DSBEL), comprised of novel Squeezed-Boosted Boundary-Region Split-Transform-Merge (SB-BR-STM) CNN and ensemble learning. The proposed S.T.M. block employs multi-path dilated convolutional, Boundary, and regional operations to capture the homogenous and heterogeneous global malicious patterns. Moreover, diverse feature maps are achieved using transfer learning and multi-path-based squeezing and boosting at initial and final levels to learn minute pattern variations. Finally, the boosted discriminative features are extracted from the developed deep SB-BR-STM CNN and provided to the ensemble classifiers (SVM, M.L.P., and AdaboostM1) to improve the hybrid learning generalization. The performance analysis of the proposed DSBEL framework and SB-BR-STM CNN against the existing techniques have been evaluated by the IOT_Malware dataset on standard performance measures. Evaluation results show progressive performance as 98.50% accuracy, 97.12% F1-Score, 91.91% MCC, 95.97 % Recall, and 98.42 % Precision. The proposed malware analysis framework is helpful for the timely detection of malicious activity and suggests future strategies. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we give efficient algorithms for privately estimating a Gaussian distribution in both pure and approximate differential privacy (DP) models with optimal dependence on the dimension in the sample complexity. In the pure DP setting, we give an efficient algorithm that estimates an unknown $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution up to an arbitrary tiny total variation error using $\\widetilde{O}(d^2 \\log \\kappa)$ samples while tolerating a constant fraction of adversarial outliers. Here, $\\kappa$ is the condition number of the target covariance matrix. The sample bound matches best non-private estimators in the dependence on the dimension (up to a polylogarithmic factor). We prove a new lower bound on differentially private covariance estimation to show that the dependence on the condition number $\\kappa$ in the above sample bound is also tight. Prior to our work, only identifiability results (yielding inefficient super-polynomial time algorithms) were known for the problem. In the approximate DP setting, we give an efficient algorithm to estimate an unknown Gaussian distribution up to an arbitrarily tiny total variation error using $\\widetilde{O}(d^2)$ samples while tolerating a constant fraction of adversarial outliers. Prior to our work, all efficient approximate DP algorithms incurred a super-quadratic sample cost or were not outlier-robust. For the special case of mean estimation, our algorithm achieves the optimal sample complexity of $\\widetilde O(d)$, improving on a $\\widetilde O(d^{1.5})$ bound from prior work. Our pure DP algorithm relies on a recursive private preconditioning subroutine that utilizes the recent work on private mean estimation [Hopkins et al., 2022].

It is formulated as an optimization problem in conventional approaches and solved iteratively in an instance-by-instance manner. Recently, learning-based methods have emerged with real-time implementation by approximating the mapping function from the problem instances to the corresponding solutions. Among various neural network architectures, graph neural networks (GNNs) can effectively utilize the graph topology in wireless networks to achieve better generalization ability on unseen problem sizes. However, the current GNNs are only equipped with the node-update mechanism, which restricts it from modeling more complicated problems such as the cooperative beamforming design, where the beamformers are on the graph edges of wireless networks. To fill this gap, we propose an edge-graph-neural-network (Edge-GNN) by incorporating an edge-update mechanism into the GNN, which learns the cooperative beamforming on the graph edges. Simulation results show that the proposed Edge-GNN achieves higher sum rate with much shorter computation time than state-of-the-art approaches, and generalizes well to different numbers of base stations and user equipments.

Cardiovascular disease is a critical illness which causes heart failure, and early and prompt identification can lessen damage and prevent premature mortality. Machine learning has been used to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the literature. The article explains choosing the best classifier model for the selected feature sets and the distinct feature sets selected using four feature selection models. The paper compares seven classifiers using each of the sixteen feature sets. Originally, the data had 56 attributes and 303 occurrences, of which 87 were in good health, and the remainder had cardiovascular disease (CVD). Demographic data with several features make up the four groups of overall features. Lasso, Tree-based algorithms, Chi-Square and RFE have all been used to choose the four distinct feature sets, each containing five, ten, fifteen, and twenty features, respectively. Seven distinct classifiers have been trained and evaluated for each of the sixteen feature sets. To determine the most effective blend of feature set and model, a total of 112 models have been trained, tested, and their performance has been compared. SVM classifier with fifteen chosen features is shown to be the best in terms of overall accuracy. The healthcare data has been maintained in the cloud and would be accessible to patients, caretakers, and healthcare providers through integration with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) enabled smart healthcare. Subsequently, the feature selection model chooses the most appropriate feature for CVD prediction to calibrate the system, and the proposed framework can be utilised to anticipate CVD. ",

In this paper, we investigate the robustness of 9 popular open-sourced image-text models under common perturbations on five tasks (image-text retrieval, visual reasoning, visual entailment, image captioning, and text-to-image generation). In particular, we propose several new multimodal robustness benchmarks by applying 17 image perturbation and 16 text perturbation techniques on top of existing datasets. We observe that multimodal models are not robust to image and text perturbations, especially to image perturbations. Among the tested perturbation methods, character-level perturbations constitute the most severe distribution shift for text, and zoom blur is the most severe shift for image data. We also introduce two new robustness metrics (MMI and MOR) for proper evaluations of multimodal models. We hope our extensive study sheds light on new directions for the development of robust multimodal models. ",

Due to the process of volumetric rendering, the inference speed for NeRF is extremely slow, limiting the application scenarios of utilizing NeRF on resource-constrained hardware, such as mobile devices. Many works have been conducted to reduce the latency of running NeRF models. However, most of them still require high-end GPU for acceleration or extra storage memory, which is all unavailable on mobile devices. Another emerging direction utilizes the neural light field (NeLF) for speedup, as only one forward pass is performed on a ray to predict the pixel color. Nevertheless, to reach a similar rendering quality as NeRF, the network in NeLF is designed with intensive computation, which is not mobile-friendly. In this work, we propose an efficient network that runs in real-time on mobile devices for neural rendering. We follow the setting of NeLF to train our network. Unlike existing works, we introduce a novel network architecture that runs efficiently on mobile devices with low latency and small size, i.e., saving $15\\times \\sim 24\\times$ storage compared with MobileNeRF. Our model achieves high-resolution generation while maintaining real-time inference for both synthetic and real-world scenes on mobile devices, e.g., $18.04$ms (iPhone 13) for rendering one $1008\\times756$ image of real 3D scenes. Additionally, we achieve similar image quality as NeRF and better quality than MobileNeRF (PSNR $26.15$ vs. $25.91$ on the real-world forward-facing dataset). ",

Stylizing NeRF, however, remains challenging, especially on simulating a text-guided style with both the appearance and the geometry altered simultaneously. In this paper, we present NeRF-Art, a text-guided NeRF stylization approach that manipulates the style of a pre-trained NeRF model with a simple text prompt. Unlike previous approaches that either lack sufficient geometry deformations and texture details or require meshes to guide the stylization, our method can shift a 3D scene to the target style characterized by desired geometry and appearance variations without any mesh guidance. This is achieved by introducing a novel global-local contrastive learning strategy, combined with the directional constraint to simultaneously control both the trajectory and the strength of the target style. Moreover, we adopt a weight regularization method to effectively suppress cloudy artifacts and geometry noises which arise easily when the density field is transformed during geometry stylization. Through extensive experiments on various styles, we demonstrate that our method is effective and robust regarding both single-view stylization quality and cross-view consistency.

Despite some recent advances addressing each of the two problems separately, no results have been reported that have theoretical guarantees on both privacy protection and saddle/maximum avoidance in decentralized nonconvex optimization. We propose a new algorithm for decentralized nonconvex optimization that can enable both rigorous differential privacy and saddle/maximum avoiding performance. The new algorithm allows the incorporation of persistent additive noise to enable rigorous differential privacy for data samples, gradients, and intermediate optimization variables without losing provable convergence, and thus circumventing the dilemma of trading accuracy for privacy in differential privacy design. More interestingly, the algorithm is theoretically proven to be able to efficiently { guarantee accuracy by avoiding} convergence to local maxima and saddle points, which has not been reported before in the literature on decentralized nonconvex optimization. The algorithm is efficient in both communication (it only shares one variable in each iteration) and computation (it is encryption-free), and hence is promising for large-scale nonconvex optimization and learning involving high-dimensional optimization parameters. Numerical experiments for both a decentralized estimation problem and an Independent Component Analysis (ICA) problem confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. ",

We propose a novel two-stage 3D contextual transformer-based U-Net for airway segmentation using CT images. The method consists of two stages, performing initial and refined airway segmentation. The two-stage model shares the same subnetwork with different airway masks as input.

In the first stage, the total airway mask and CT images are provided to the subnetwork, and the intrapulmonary airway mask and corresponding CT scans to the subnetwork in the second stage. Then the predictions of the two-stage method are merged as the final prediction. Extensive experiments were performed on in-house and multiple public datasets.

Due to this reason, one-shot learning still remains one of the most challenging and trending concepts of deep learning as it proposes to simulate the human-like learning approach in classification problems. Previous studies have focused on generating more accurate fingerprints of the population using graph neural networks (GNNs) with connectomic brain graph data. Thereby, generated population fingerprints named connectional brain template (CBTs) enabled detecting discriminative bio-markers of the population on classification tasks. However, the reverse problem of data augmentation from single graph data representing brain connectivity has never been tackled before. In this paper, we propose an augmentation pipeline in order to provide improved metrics on our binary classification problem. Divergently from the previous studies, we examine augmentation from a single population template by utilizing graph-based generative adversarial network (gGAN) architecture for a classification problem. We benchmarked our proposed solution on AD/LMCI dataset consisting of brain connectomes with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI). In order to evaluate our model's generalizability, we used cross-validation strategy and randomly sampled the folds multiple times. Our results on classification not only provided better accuracy when augmented data generated from one sample is introduced, but yields more balanced results on other metrics as well. ",

The reliability of these simulators for constantly refined tasks is becoming an issue and, to increase the number of tests, the industry is now developing surrogate models, that should mimic the behavior of the simulator while being much faster to run on specific tasks. In this paper we aim to construct a surrogate model to mimic and replace the simulator. We first test several classical methods such as random forests, ridge regression or convolutional neural networks. Then we build three hybrid models that use all these methods and combine them to obtain an efficient hybrid surrogate model. ",

    "title": "Scalable Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification for Neural Network  Potentials: Promise and Pitfalls",
    "abstract": "Neural network (NN) potentials promise highly accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations within the computational complexity of classical MD force fields. However, when applied outside their training domain, NN potential predictions can be inaccurate, increasing the need for Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). Bayesian modeling provides the mathematical framework for UQ, but classical Bayesian methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) are computationally intractable for NN potentials. By training graph NN potentials for coarse-grained systems of liquid water and alanine dipeptide, we demonstrate here that scalable Bayesian UQ via stochastic gradient MCMC (SG-MCMC) yields reliable uncertainty estimates for MD observables. We show that cold posteriors can reduce the required training data size and that for reliable UQ, multiple Markov chains are needed. Additionally, we find that SG-MCMC and the Deep Ensemble method achieve comparable results, despite shorter training and less hyperparameter tuning of the latter. We show that both methods can capture aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty reliably, but not systematic uncertainty, which needs to be minimized by adequate modeling to obtain accurate credible intervals for MD observables. Our results represent a step towards accurate UQ that is of vital importance for trustworthy NN potential-based MD simulations required for decision-making in practice. ",
