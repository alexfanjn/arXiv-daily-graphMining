    "title": "Fairify: Fairness Verification of Neural Networks",
    "abstract": "Fairness of machine learning (ML) software has become a major concern in the recent past. Although recent research on testing and improving fairness have demonstrated impact on real-world software, providing fairness guarantee in practice is still lacking. Certification of ML models is challenging because of the complex decision-making process of the models. In this paper, we proposed Fairify, the first SMT-based approach to verify individual fairness property in neural network (NN) models. Individual fairness ensures that any two similar individuals get similar treatment irrespective of their protected attributes e.g., race, sex, age. Verifying this fairness property is hard because of its global nature and the presence of non-linear computation nodes in NN. We proposed sound approach to make individual fairness verification tractable for the developers. The key idea is that many neurons in the NN always remain inactive when a smaller part of the input domain is considered. So, Fairify leverages white-box access to the models in production and then apply formal analysis based pruning. Our approach adopts input partitioning and then prunes the NN for each partition to provide fairness certification or counterexample. We leveraged interval arithmetic and activation heuristic of the neurons to perform the pruning as necessary. We evaluated Fairify on 25 real-world neural networks collected from four different sources, and demonstrated the effectiveness, scalability and performance over baseline and closely related work. Fairify is also configurable based on the domain and size of the NN. Our novel formulation of the problem can answer targeted verification queries with relaxations and counterexamples, which have practical implications. ",

    "abstract": "Photonic neural network (PNN) is a remarkable analog artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator that computes with photons instead of electrons to feature low latency, high energy efficiency, and high parallelism. However, the existing training approaches cannot address the extensive accumulation of systematic errors in large-scale PNNs, resulting in a significant decrease in model performance in physical systems. Here, we propose dual adaptive training (DAT) that allows the PNN model to adapt to substantial systematic errors and preserves its performance during the deployment. By introducing the systematic error prediction networks with task-similarity joint optimization, DAT achieves the high similarity mapping between the PNN numerical models and physical systems and high-accurate gradient calculations during the dual backpropagation training. We validated the effectiveness of DAT by using diffractive PNNs and interference-based PNNs on image classification tasks. DAT successfully trained large-scale PNNs under major systematic errors and preserved the model classification accuracies comparable to error-free systems. The results further demonstrated its superior performance over the state-of-the-art in situ training approaches. DAT provides critical support for constructing large-scale PNNs to achieve advanced architectures and can be generalized to other types of AI systems with analog computing errors. ",

    "title": "Optimizing Learning Rate Schedules for Iterative Pruning of Deep Neural  Networks",
    "abstract": "The importance of learning rate (LR) schedules on network pruning has been observed in a few recent works. As an example, Frankle and Carbin (2019) highlighted that winning tickets (i.e., accuracy preserving subnetworks) can not be found without applying a LR warmup schedule and Renda, Frankle and Carbin (2020) demonstrated that rewinding the LR to its initial state at the end of each pruning cycle improves performance. In this paper, we go one step further by first providing a theoretical justification for the surprising effect of LR schedules. Next, we propose a LR schedule for network pruning called SILO, which stands for S-shaped Improved Learning rate Optimization. The advantages of SILO over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) LR schedules are two-fold: (i) SILO has a strong theoretical motivation and dynamically adjusts the LR during pruning to improve generalization. Specifically, SILO increases the LR upper bound (max_lr) in an S-shape. This leads to an improvement of 2% - 4% in extensive experiments with various types of networks (e.g., Vision Transformers, ResNet) on popular datasets such as ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100. (ii) In addition to the strong theoretical motivation, SILO is empirically optimal in the sense of matching an Oracle, which exhaustively searches for the optimal value of max_lr via grid search. We find that SILO is able to precisely adjust the value of max_lr to be within the Oracle optimized interval, resulting in performance competitive with the Oracle with significantly lower complexity.

    "abstract": "The rectified linear unit (ReLU) is a highly successful activation function in neural networks as it allows networks to easily obtain sparse representations, which reduces overfitting in overparameterized networks. However, in network pruning, we find that the sparsity introduced by ReLU, which we quantify by a term called dynamic dead neuron rate (DNR), is not beneficial for the pruned network. Interestingly, the more the network is pruned, the smaller the dynamic DNR becomes during optimization. This motivates us to propose a method to explicitly reduce the dynamic DNR for the pruned network, i.e., de-sparsify the network. We refer to our method as Activating-while-Pruning (AP). We note that AP does not function as a stand-alone method, as it does not evaluate the importance of weights. Instead, it works in tandem with existing pruning methods and aims to improve their performance by selective activation of nodes to reduce the dynamic DNR. We conduct extensive experiments using popular networks (e.g., ResNet, VGG) via two classical and three state-of-the-art pruning methods. The experimental results on public datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10/100) suggest that AP works well with existing pruning methods and improves the performance by 3% - 4%. For larger scale datasets (e.g., ImageNet) and state-of-the-art networks (e.g., vision transformer), we observe an improvement of 2% - 3% with AP as opposed to without. Lastly, we conduct an ablation study to examine the effectiveness of the components comprising AP. ",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in in-situ monitoring and process control in Additive Manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D-printing, allows the collection of large amounts of emission data during the build process of the parts being manufactured. This data can be used as input into 3D and 2D representations of the 3D-printed parts. However the analysis and use, as well as the characterization of this data still remains a manual process. The aim of this paper is to propose an adaptive human-in-the-loop approach using Machine Learning techniques that automatically inspect and annotate the emissions data generated during the AM process. More specifically, this paper will look at two scenarios: firstly, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically inspect and classify emission data collected by in-situ monitoring and secondly, applying Active Learning techniques to the developed classification model to construct a human-in-the-loop mechanism in order to accelerate the labeling process of the emission data. The CNN-based approach relies on transfer learning and fine-tuning, which makes the approach applicable to other industrial image patterns. The adaptive nature of the approach is enabled by uncertainty sampling strategy to automatic selection of samples to be presented to human experts for annotation. ",

    "abstract": "Many policies in the US are determined locally, e.g., at the county-level. Local policy regimes provide flexibility between regions, but may become less effective in the presence of geographic spillovers, where populations circumvent local restrictions by traveling to less restricted regions nearby. Due to the endogenous nature of policymaking, there have been few opportunities to reliably estimate causal spillover effects or evaluate their impact on local policies. In this work, we identify a novel setting and develop a suitable methodology that allow us to make unconfounded estimates of spillover effects of local policies. Focusing on California's Blueprint for a Safer Economy, we leverage how county-level mobility restrictions were deterministically set by public COVID-19 severity statistics, enabling a regression discontinuity design framework to estimate spillovers between counties. We estimate these effects using a mobility network with billions of timestamped edges and find significant spillover movement, with larger effects in retail, eating places, and gyms. Contrasting local and global policy regimes, our spillover estimates suggest that county-level restrictions are only 54% as effective as statewide restrictions at reducing mobility. However, an intermediate strategy of macro-county restrictions -- where we optimize county partitions by solving a minimum k-cut problem on a graph weighted by our spillover estimates -- can recover over 90% of statewide mobility reductions, while maintaining substantial flexibility between counties.

Neural prediction models, especially when capitalising on clinical notes, have been put forward as improvement on currently existing models. However, to be acceptable these models should be performant and transparent. This work studies different attention mechanisms for clinical neural prediction models in terms of their discrimination and calibration. Specifically, we investigate sparse attention as an alternative to dense attention weights in the task of in-hospital mortality prediction from clinical notes. We evaluate the attention mechanisms based on: i) local self-attention over words in a sentence, and ii) global self-attention with a transformer architecture across sentences. We demonstrate that the sparse mechanism approach outperforms the dense one for the local self-attention in terms of predictive performance with a publicly available dataset, and puts higher attention to prespecified relevant directive words. The performance at the sentence level, however, deteriorates as sentences including the influential directive words tend to be dropped all together. ",

Examples of these networks include smart home networks, wireless sensor networks, Internet of Flying Things, and many others. One of the main difficulties that confront these networks is the security of their information and communications.

Among these solutions is the blockchain, which gained popularity in the last few years due to its strong security characteristics, such as immutability, cryptography, and distributed consensus. However, implementing the blockchain framework within the devices of these networks is very challenging, due to the limited resources of these devices and the resource-demanding requirements of the blockchain. For this reason, a large number of researchers proposed various types of lightweight blockchain solutions for resource-constrained networks. The \"lightweight\" aspect can be related to the blockchain architecture, device authentication, cryptography model, consensus algorithm, or storage method. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of the lightweight blockchain solutions that have been proposed in the literature and discuss the different methods that have been applied so far in each \"lightweight\" category. Our review highlights the missing points in existing systems and paves the way to building a complete lightweight blockchain solution for resource-constrained networks. ",

One of the most fruitful research and practice areas emerging from this data-rich, cyber-physical, smart factory environment is the data-driven process monitoring field, which applies machine learning methodologies to enable predictive maintenance applications. In this paper, we examine popular time series forecasting techniques as well as supervised machine learning algorithms in the applied context of Industry 4.0, by transforming and preprocessing the historical industrial dataset of a packing machine's operational state recordings (real data coming from the production line of a manufacturing plant from the food and beverage domain). In our methodology, we use only a single signal concerning the machine's operational status to make our predictions, without considering other operational variables or fault and warning signals, hence its characterization as ``agnostic''. In this respect, the results demonstrate that the adopted methods achieve a quite promising performance on three targeted use cases. ",

The bounded data uncertainty (BDU) considered in the power network is a structured uncertainty which is inevitable in practical systems due to error in transmission lines, inaccurate modelling, unmodeled dynamics, parameter variations, and other various reasons. In the proposed approach, the corresponding network is first decomposed into smaller subsystems (areas), and then a two-level algorithm is presented for state estimation. In this algorithm, at the first level, each area uses a weighted least squares (WLS) technique to estimate its own states based on a robust hybrid estimation utilizing phasor measurement units (PMUs), and at the second level, the central coordinator processes all the results from the subareas and gives a robust estimation of the entire system. The simulation results for IEEE 30-bus test system verifies the accuracy and performance of the proposed multi-area robust estimator. ",

As promising surrogate solvers of partial differential equations (PDEs) for real-time prediction, deep neural operators such as deep operator networks (DeepONets) provide a new simulation paradigm in science and engineering. Pure data-driven neural operators and deep learning models, in general, are usually limited to interpolation scenarios, where new predictions utilize inputs within the support of the training set. However, in the inference stage of real-world applications, the input may lie outside the support, i.e., extrapolation is required, which may result to large errors and unavoidable failure of deep learning models. Here, we address this challenge of extrapolation for deep neural operators. First, we systematically investigate the extrapolation behavior of DeepONets by quantifying the extrapolation complexity via the 2-Wasserstein distance between two function spaces and propose a new behavior of bias-variance trade-off for extrapolation with respect to model capacity. Subsequently, we develop a complete workflow, including extrapolation determination, and we propose five reliable learning methods that guarantee a safe prediction under extrapolation by requiring additional information -- the governing PDEs of the system or sparse new observations. The proposed methods are based on either fine-tuning a pre-trained DeepONet or multifidelity learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for various types of parametric PDEs. Our systematic comparisons provide practical guidelines for selecting a proper extrapolation method depending on the available information, desired accuracy, and required inference speed. ",

However, existing modeling of time-activity trajectory is only driven by socio-demographic information with identical activity trajectories shared among the same group of people and neglects the influence of the environment. To further improve human time-activity trajectory modeling, this paper constructs community time-activity trajectory and analyzes how social-demographic and built environment influence people s activity trajectory based on Markov Chains and Dirichlet Regression. We use the New York area as a case study and gather data from American Time Use Survey, Policy Map, and the New York City Energy & Water Performance Map to evaluate the proposed method. To validate the regression model, Box s M Test and T-test are performed with 80% data training the model and the left 20% as the test sample. The modeling results align well with the actual human behavior trajectories, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. It also shows that both social-demographic and built environment factors will significantly impact a community's time-activity trajectory. Specifically, 1) Diversity and median age both have a significant influence on the proportion of time people assign to education activity. 2) Transportation condition affects people s activity trajectory in the way that longer commute time decreases the proportion of biological activity (eg. sleeping and eating) and increases people s working time. 3) Residential density affects almost all activities with a significant p-value for all biological needs, household management, working, education, and personal preference.

    "abstract": "Accurate uncertainty quantification is necessary to enhance the reliability of deep learning models in real-world applications. In the case of regression tasks, prediction intervals (PIs) should be provided along with the deterministic predictions of deep learning models. Such PIs are useful or \"high-quality'' as long as they are sufficiently narrow and capture most of the probability density. In this paper, we present a method to learn prediction intervals for regression-based neural networks automatically in addition to the conventional target predictions. In particular, we train two companion neural networks: one that uses one output, the target estimate, and another that uses two outputs, the upper and lower bounds of the corresponding PI. Our main contribution is the design of a loss function for the PI-generation network that takes into account the output of the target-estimation network and has two optimization objectives: minimizing the mean prediction interval width and ensuring the PI integrity using constraints that maximize the prediction interval probability coverage implicitly. Both objectives are balanced within the loss function using a self-adaptive coefficient. Furthermore, we apply a Monte Carlo-based approach that evaluates the model uncertainty in the learned PIs. Experiments using a synthetic dataset, six benchmark datasets, and a real-world crop yield prediction dataset showed that our method was able to maintain a nominal probability coverage and produce narrower PIs without detriment to its target estimation accuracy when compared to those PIs generated by three state-of-the-art neural-network-based methods.

    "abstract": "Phoneme boundary detection has been studied due to its central role in various speech applications. In this work, we point out that this task needs to be addressed not only by algorithmic way, but also by evaluation metric. To this end, we first propose a state-of-the-art phoneme boundary detector that operates in an autoregressive manner, dubbed SuperSeg. Experiments on the TIMIT and Buckeye corpora demonstrates that SuperSeg identifies phoneme boundaries with significant margin compared to existing models. Furthermore, we note that there is a limitation on the popular evaluation metric, R-value, and propose new evaluation metrics that prevent each boundary from contributing to evaluation multiple times. The proposed metrics reveal the weaknesses of non-autoregressive baselines and establishes a reliable criterion that suits for evaluating phoneme boundary detection. ",

The proposed protocol includes content-based multicasting using angular sector division rather than grids, along with dynamic core-based mesh protocol defining certain core active nodes and passive nodes forming the convex hull. The transmission (multicasting and broadcasting) between the nodes will be evaluated using the link probability defining the probability of the link between two nodes failing.

    "abstract": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication system between humans and computers reflecting human intention without using a physical control device. Since deep learning is robust in extracting features from data, research on decoding electroencephalograms by applying deep learning has progressed in the BCI domain. However, the application of deep learning in the BCI domain has issues with a lack of data and overconfidence. To solve these issues, we proposed a novel data augmentation method, CropCat. CropCat consists of two versions, CropCat-spatial and CropCat-temporal. We designed our method by concatenating the cropped data after cropping the data, which have different labels in spatial and temporal axes. In addition, we adjusted the label based on the ratio of cropped length. As a result, the generated data from our proposed method assisted in revising the ambiguous decision boundary into apparent caused by a lack of data. Due to the effectiveness of the proposed method, the performance of the four EEG signal decoding models is improved in two motor imagery public datasets compared to when the proposed method is not applied. Hence, we demonstrate that generated data by CropCat smooths the feature distribution of EEG signals when training the model. ",

    "abstract": "Traffic forecasting has attracted widespread attention recently. In reality, traffic data usually contains missing values due to sensor or communication errors. The Spatio-temporal feature in traffic data brings more challenges for processing such missing values, for which the classic techniques (e.g., data imputations) are limited: 1) in temporal axis, the values can be randomly or consecutively missing; 2) in spatial axis, the missing values can happen on one single sensor or on multiple sensors simultaneously. Recent models powered by Graph Neural Networks achieved satisfying performance on traffic forecasting tasks. However, few of them are applicable to such a complex missing-value context. To this end, we propose GCN-M, a Graph Convolutional Network model with the ability to handle the complex missing values in the Spatio-temporal context. Particularly, we jointly model the missing value processing and traffic forecasting tasks, considering both local Spatio-temporal features and global historical patterns in an attention-based memory network. We propose as well a dynamic graph learning module based on the learned local-global features. The experimental results on real-life datasets show the reliability of our proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the impressive success of contrastive learning (CL), a variety of graph augmentation strategies have been employed to learn node representations in a self-supervised manner. Existing methods construct the contrastive samples by adding perturbations to the graph structure or node attributes. Although impressive results are achieved, it is rather blind to the wealth of prior information assumed: with the increase of the perturbation degree applied on the original graph, 1) the similarity between the original graph and the generated augmented graph gradually decreases; 2) the discrimination between all nodes within each augmented view gradually increases. In this paper, we argue that both such prior information can be incorporated (differently) into the contrastive learning paradigm following our general ranking framework. In particular, we first interpret CL as a special case of learning to rank (L2R), which inspires us to leverage the ranking order among positive augmented views. Meanwhile, we introduce a self-ranking paradigm to ensure that the discriminative information among different nodes can be maintained and also be less altered to the perturbations of different degrees. Experiment results on various benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our algorithm compared with the supervised and unsupervised models. ",

    "abstract": "Cloud-edge collaborative inference approach splits deep neural networks (DNNs) into two parts that run collaboratively on resource-constrained edge devices and cloud servers, aiming at minimizing inference latency and protecting data privacy. However, even if the raw input data from edge devices is not directly exposed to the cloud, state-of-the-art attacks targeting collaborative inference are still able to reconstruct the raw private data from the intermediate outputs of the exposed local models, introducing serious privacy risks. In this paper, a secure privacy inference framework for cloud-edge collaboration is proposed, termed CIS, which supports adaptively partitioning the network according to the dynamically changing network bandwidth and fully releases the computational power of edge devices. To mitigate the influence introduced by private perturbation, CIS provides a way to achieve differential privacy protection by adding refined noise to the intermediate layer feature maps offloaded to the cloud. Meanwhile, with a given total privacy budget, the budget is reasonably allocated by the size of the feature graph rank generated by different convolution filters, which makes the inference in the cloud robust to the perturbed data, thus effectively trade-off the conflicting problem between privacy and availability. Finally, we construct a real cloud-edge collaborative inference computing scenario to verify the effectiveness of inference latency and model partitioning on resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, the state-of-the-art cloud-edge collaborative reconstruction attack is used to evaluate the practical availability of the end-to-end privacy protection mechanism provided by CIS. ",

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and more specifically long short-term memory nets (LSTMs), stand out in terms of popularity. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of such an LSTM to actually learn the underlying process model structure of an event log. We introduce an evaluation framework that combines variant-based resampling and custom metrics for fitness, precision and generalization. We evaluate 4 hypotheses concerning the learning capabilities of LSTMs, the effect of overfitting countermeasures, the level of incompleteness in the training set and the level of parallelism in the underlying process model. We confirm that LSTMs can struggle to learn process model structure, even with simplistic process data and in a very lenient setup. Taking the correct anti-overfitting measures can alleviate the problem. However, these measures did not present themselves to be optimal when selecting hyperparameters purely on predicting accuracy. We also found that decreasing the amount of information seen by the LSTM during training, causes a sharp drop in generalization and precision scores. In our experiments, we could not identify a relationship between the extent of parallelism in the model and the generalization capability, but they do indicate that the process' complexity might have impact.

Generally, the adversarial attack for object detection contains targeted attack and untargeted attack. According to our detailed investigations, the research on the former is relatively fewer than the latter and all the existing methods for the targeted attack follow the same mode, i.e., the object-mislabeling mode that misleads detectors to mislabel the detected object as a specific wrong label. However, this mode has limited attack success rate, universal and generalization performances. In this paper, we propose a new object-fabrication targeted attack mode which can mislead detectors to `fabricate' extra false objects with specific target labels. Furthermore, we design a dual attention based targeted feature space attack method to implement the proposed targeted attack mode. The attack performances of the proposed mode and method are evaluated on MS COCO and BDD100K datasets using FasterRCNN and YOLOv5. Evaluation results demonstrate that, the proposed object-fabrication targeted attack mode and the corresponding targeted feature space attack method show significant improvements in terms of image-specific attack, universal performance and generalization capability, compared with the previous targeted attack for object detection.

One way to obtain a measure of trust is through reputation mechanisms, which record one's past performance and interactions to generate a reputational value. We observe that numerous existing reputation mechanisms share similarities with actual social phenomena; we call such mechanisms 'social reputation mechanisms'. The aim of this paper is to discuss several social phenomena and map these to existing social reputation mechanisms in a variety of scopes. First, we focus on reputation mechanisms in the individual scope, in which everyone is responsible for their own reputation. Subjective reputational values may be communicated to different entities in the form of recommendations. Secondly, we discuss social reputation mechanisms in the acquaintances scope, where one's reputation can be tied to another through vouching or invite-only networks. Finally, we present existing social reputation mechanisms in the neighbourhood scope. In such systems, one's reputation can heavily be affected by the behaviour of others in their neighbourhood or social group. ",

Link prediction is recognized as a common practice to build the topology of social networks and keep them evolving. Conventionally, link prediction methods are dependent of location information of users, which suffers from information leakage from time to time. To deal with this problem, companies of smart devices (e.g., Apple Inc.) keeps tightening their privacy policy, impeding internet service providers from acquiring location information. Therefore, it is of great importance to design location free link prediction methods, while the accuracy still preserves. In this study, a novel location free link prediction method is proposed for complex social networks. Experiments on real datasets show that the precision of our location free link prediction method increases by 10 percent. ",

However, it is unavoidable to construct undesirable views containing different semantic concepts during the augmentation procedure. It would damage the semantic consistency of representation to pull these augmentations closer in the feature space indiscriminately. In this study, we introduce feature-level augmentation and propose a novel semantics-consistent feature search (SCFS) method to mitigate this negative effect. The main idea of SCFS is to adaptively search semantics-consistent features to enhance the contrast between semantics-consistent regions in different augmentations. Thus, the trained model can learn to focus on meaningful object regions, improving the semantic representation ability. Extensive experiments conducted on different datasets and tasks demonstrate that SCFS effectively improves the performance of self-supervised learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on different downstream tasks.

Past studies have proposed machine learning-based methods for detecting such fake news, focusing on different properties of the published news articles, such as linguistic characteristics of the actual content, which however have limitations due to the apparent language barriers. Departing from such efforts, we propose FNDaaS, the first automatic, content-agnostic fake news detection method, that considers new and unstudied features such as network and structural characteristics per news website. This method can be enforced as-a-Service, either at the ISP-side for easier scalability and maintenance, or user-side for better end-user privacy. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method using data crawled from existing lists of 637 fake and 1183 real news websites, and by building and testing a proof of concept system that materializes our proposal. Our analysis of data collected from these websites shows that the vast majority of fake news domains are very young and appear to have lower time periods of an IP associated with their domain than real news ones. By conducting various experiments with machine learning classifiers, we demonstrate that FNDaaS can achieve an AUC score of up to 0.967 on past sites, and up to 77-92% accuracy on newly-flagged ones.

    "abstract": "Among the major challenges in neural control system technology is the validation and certification of the safety and robustness of neural network (NN) controllers against various uncertainties including unmodelled dynamics, non-linearities, and time delays. One way in providing such validation guarantees is to maintain the closed-loop system output with a NN controller when its input changes within a bounded set, close to the output of a robustly performing closed-loop reference model. This paper presents a novel approach to analysing the performance and robustness of uncertain feedback systems with NN controllers. Due to the complexity of analysing such systems, the problem is reformulated as the problem of dynamical tracking errors between the closed-loop system with a neural controller and an ideal closed-loop reference model. Then, the approximation of the controller error is characterised by adopting the differential mean value theorem (DMV) and the Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs) technique. Moreover, the Relative Integral Square Error (RISE) and the Supreme Square Error (SSE) bounded set are derived for the output of the error dynamical system. The analysis is then performed by integrating Lyapunov theory with the IQCs-based technique. The resulting worst-case analysis provides the user a prior knowledge about the worst case of RISE and SSE between the reference closed-loop model and the uncertain system controlled by the neural controller. The suitability of the proposed technique is demonstrated by the results obtained on a nonlinear single-link robot system with a NN trained to control the movement of this mechanical system while keeping close to an ideal closed-loop reference model.

Hence, companies regularly publish sustainability reports to shed light on their impact on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. Problem: Sustainability reports are written by companies themselves and are therefore considered a company-controlled source. Contrary, studies reveal that non-corporate channels (e.g., media coverage) represent the main driver for ESG transparency. However, analysing media coverage regarding ESG factors is challenging since (1) the amount of published news articles grows daily, (2) media coverage data does not necessarily deal with an ESG-relevant topic, meaning that it must be carefully filtered, and (3) the majority of media coverage data is unstructured. Research Goal: We aim to extract ESG-relevant information from textual media reactions automatically to calculate an ESG score for a given company. Our goal is to reduce the cost of ESG data collection and make ESG information available to the general public. Contribution: Our contributions are three-fold: First, we publish a corpus of 432,411 news headlines annotated as being environmental-, governance-, social-related, or ESG-irrelevant. Second, we present our tool-supported approach called ESG-Miner capable of analyzing and evaluating headlines on corporate ESG-performance automatically. Third, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in an experiment and apply the ESG-Miner on 3000 manually labeled headlines.

Modelling SD as TER may offer benefits like more training data and a more general learning scheme. In this paper, we present an initial empirical analysis of this approach. We apply it to a difficult but relevant test case where no existing labelled SD dataset is available, because this is where modelling SD as TER may be especially helpful. We also leverage measurement knowledge from social sciences to improve model performance. We discuss our findings and suggest future research directions. ",

    "abstract": "Fake news detection has become a research area that goes way beyond a purely academic interest as it has direct implications on our society as a whole. Recent advances have primarily focused on textbased approaches. However, it has become clear that to be effective one needs to incorporate additional, contextual information such as spreading behaviour of news articles and user interaction patterns on social media. We propose to construct heterogeneous social context graphs around news articles and reformulate the problem as a graph classification task. Exploring the incorporation of different types of information (to get an idea as to what level of social context is most effective) and using different graph neural network architectures indicates that this approach is highly effective with robust results on a common benchmark dataset.

    "abstract": "Climate change, population growth, and water scarcity present unprecedented challenges for agriculture. This project aims to forecast soil moisture using domain knowledge and machine learning for crop management decisions that enable sustainable farming. Traditional methods for predicting hydrological response features require significant computational time and expertise. Recent work has implemented machine learning models as a tool for forecasting hydrological response features, but these models neglect a crucial component of traditional hydrological modeling that spatially close units can have vastly different hydrological responses. In traditional hydrological modeling, units with similar hydrological properties are grouped together and share model parameters regardless of their spatial proximity. Inspired by this domain knowledge, we have constructed a novel domain-inspired temporal graph convolution neural network. Our approach involves clustering units based on time-varying hydrological properties, constructing graph topologies for each cluster, and forecasting soil moisture using graph convolutions and a gated recurrent neural network. We have trained, validated, and tested our method on field-scale time series data consisting of approximately 99,000 hydrological response units spanning 40 years in a case study in northeastern United States. Comparison with existing models illustrates the effectiveness of using domain-inspired clustering with time series graph neural networks. The framework is being deployed as part of a pro bono social impact program. The trained models are being deployed on small-holding farms in central Texas. ",

Furthermore, we propose to capture high-resolution semantic representations progressively based on a simple top-down decoder with the proposed MSA to attain precise segmentation results. These structures plus a backbone encoder form a new model, dubbed CamoFormer.

The Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma can be easily adapted to the weighted Euclidean distance if weights are known at construction time. Given a set of $n$ vectors with dimension $d$, it suffices to scale each dimension of the input vectors according to the weights, and then apply any standard JL reduction: the weighted Euclidean distance between pairs of vectors is preserved within a multiplicative factor $\\epsilon$ with high probability. However, this is not the case when weights are provided after the dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we show that by applying a linear map from real vectors to a complex vector space, it is possible to update the compressed vectors so that the weighted Euclidean distances between pairs of points can be computed within a multiplicative factor $\\epsilon$, even when weights are provided after the dimensionality reduction. Finally, we consider the estimation of weighted Euclidean norms in streaming settings: we show how to estimate the weighted norm when the weights are provided either after or concurrently with the input vector.

The intruders' objective is to breach the target boundary without being captured by the defender. As soon as the current intruder breaches the target or gets captured by the defender, the next intruder appears at a random location on a fixed circle surrounding the target. Therefore, the defender's final location at the end of the current game becomes its initial location for the next game. Thus, the players pick strategies that are advantageous for the current as well as for the future games. Depending on the information available to the players, each game is divided into two phases: partial information and full information phase. Under some assumptions on the sensing and speed capabilities, we analyze the agents' strategies in both phases. We derive equilibrium strategies for both the players to optimize the capture percentage using the notions of engagement surface and capture circle. We quantify the percentage of capture for both finite and infinite sequences of incoming intruders. ",

Functions over integer lattice have been defined submodular property that is similar to submodularity of set functions. DR-submodular is a further extended submodular concept for functions over the integer lattice, which captures the diminishing return property. Such functions find many applications in machine learning, social networks, wireless networks, etc. The techniques for submodular set function maximization can be applied to DR-submodular function maximization, e.g., the double greedy algorithm has a $1/2$-approximation ratio, whose running time is $O(nB)$, where $n$ is the size of the ground set, $B$ is the integer bound of a coordinate. In our study, we design a $1/2$-approximate binary search double greedy algorithm, and we prove that its time complexity is $O(n\\log B)$, which significantly improves the running time. Specifically, we consider its application to the profit maximization problem in social networks with a bipartite model, the goal of this problem is to maximize the net profit gained from a product promoting activity, which is the difference of the influence gain and the promoting cost. We prove that the objective function is DR-submodular over integer lattice. We apply binary search double greedy algorithm to this problem and verify the effectiveness. ",

The main process is to use deep neural networks to extract the features of an image and then use the features to identify the class and location of an object. Therefore, the main direction to improve the accuracy of object detection tasks is to improve the neural network to extract features better. In this paper, I propose a convolutional module with a transformer[1], which aims to improve the recognition accuracy of the model by fusing the detailed features extracted by CNN[2] with the global features extracted by a transformer and significantly reduce the computational effort of the transformer module by deflating the feature mAP. The main execution steps are convolutional downsampling to reduce the feature map size, then self-attention calculation and upsampling, and finally concatenation with the initial input. In the experimental part, after splicing the block to the end of YOLOv5n[3] and training 300 epochs on the coco dataset, the mAP improved by 1.7% compared with the previous YOLOv5n, and the mAP curve did not show any saturation phenomenon, so there is still potential for improvement. After 100 rounds of training on the Pascal VOC dataset, the accuracy of the results reached 81%, which is 4.6 better than the faster RCNN[4] using resnet101[5] as the backbone, but the number of parameters is less than one-twentieth of it.

However, increased enumeration of and transparency in data privacy policies has not improved end-users' comprehension of how their data might be used: not only are privacy policies written in legal language that users may struggle to understand, but elements of these policies may compose in such a way that the consequences of the policy are not immediately apparent. We present a framework that uses Answer Set Programming (ASP) -- a type of logic programming -- to formalize privacy policies. Privacy policies thus become constraints on a narrative planning space, allowing end-users to forward-simulate possible consequences of the policy in terms of actors having roles and taking actions in a domain. We demonstrate through the example of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) how to use the system in various ways, including asking questions about possibilities and identifying which clauses of the law are broken by a given sequence of events.

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) exploits deep learning techniques to autonomously produce neural network architectures whose results rival the state-of-the-art models hand-crafted by AI experts. However, this approach requires significant computational resources and hardware investments, making it less appealing for real-usage applications. This article presents the third version of Pareto-Optimal Progressive Neural Architecture Search (POPNASv3), a new sequential model-based optimization NAS algorithm targeting different hardware environments and multiple classification tasks. Our method is able to find competitive architectures within large search spaces, while keeping a flexible structure and data processing pipeline to adapt to different tasks. The algorithm employs Pareto optimality to reduce the number of architectures sampled during the search, drastically improving the time efficiency without loss in accuracy. The experiments performed on images and time series classification datasets provide evidence that POPNASv3 can explore a large set of assorted operators and converge to optimal architectures suited for the type of data provided under different scenarios.

To do so, we show that for any two vertices $u,v$ in a minimum separating set $S$, the distance between $u$ and $v$ in an auxiliary graph $\\Lambda(G)$ (obtained by planarizing $G$ and then inserting into each face a new vertex adjacent to all vertices of the face) is small.

As a result, a rapid increase in the usage of such systems can be observed in the healthcare industry, for instance in the form of medical image classification systems, where these models have achieved diagnostic parity with human physicians. One such application where this can be observed is in computer vision tasks such as the classification of skin lesions in dermatoscopic images. However, as stakeholders in the healthcare industry, such as insurance companies, continue to invest extensively in machine learning infrastructure, it becomes increasingly important to understand the vulnerabilities in such systems. Due to the highly critical nature of the tasks being carried out by these machine learning models, it is necessary to analyze techniques that could be used to take advantage of these vulnerabilities and methods to defend against them. This paper explores common adversarial attack techniques. The Fast Sign Gradient Method and Projected Descent Gradient are used against a Convolutional Neural Network trained to classify dermatoscopic images of skin lesions. Following that, it also discusses one of the most popular adversarial defense techniques, adversarial training. The performance of the model that has been trained on adversarial examples is then tested against the previously mentioned attacks, and recommendations to improve neural networks robustness are thus provided based on the results of the experiment.

Given the existence of numerous attribution methods and a lack of quantitative results on the fidelity of those methods, selection of an attribution method for sequence-based tasks has been mostly done qualitatively. In this work, we take a step towards identifying the most faithful attribution method by proposing a computational approach that utilizes point mutations. Providing quantitative results on seven popular attribution methods, we find Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to be the most appropriate one for translation initiation, with LRP identifying two important biological features for translation: the integrity of Kozak sequence as well as the detrimental effects of premature stop codons.

Researchers have generalized such binary networks to incorporate edge weights, which allow one to encode node--node interactions with heterogeneous intensities or frequencies (e.g., in transportation networks, supply chains, and social networks). Most such studies have considered real-valued weights, despite the fact that networks with complex weights arise in fields as diverse as quantum information, quantum chemistry, electrodynamics, rheology, and machine learning. Many of the standard approaches from network science that originated in the study of classical systems and are based on real-valued edge weights cannot be applied directly to networks with complex edge weights. In this paper, we examine how standard network-analysis methods fail to capture structural features of networks with complex weights. We then generalize several network measures to the complex domain and show that random-walk centralities provide a useful tool to examine node importances in networks with complex weights. ",

    "abstract": "U-shaped networks are widely used in various medical image tasks, such as segmentation, restoration and reconstruction, but most of them usually rely on centralized learning and thus ignore privacy issues. To address the privacy concerns, federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) have attracted increasing attention. However, it is hard for both FL and SL to balance the local computational cost, model privacy and parallel training simultaneously. To achieve this goal, in this paper, we propose Robust Split Federated Learning (RoS-FL) for U-shaped medical image networks, which is a novel hybrid learning paradigm of FL and SL. Previous works cannot preserve the data privacy, including the input, model parameters, label and output simultaneously. To effectively deal with all of them, we design a novel splitting method for U-shaped medical image networks, which splits the network into three parts hosted by different parties. Besides, the distributed learning methods usually suffer from a drift between local and global models caused by data heterogeneity. Based on this consideration, we propose a dynamic weight correction strategy (\\textbf{DWCS}) to stabilize the training process and avoid model drift. Specifically, a weight correction loss is designed to quantify the drift between the models from two adjacent communication rounds. By minimizing this loss, a correction model is obtained. Then we treat the weighted sum of correction model and final round models as the result. The effectiveness of the proposed RoS-FL is supported by extensive experimental results on different tasks.

    "title": "Solving Sample-Level Out-of-Distribution Detection on 3D Medical Images",
    "abstract": "Deep Learning (DL) models tend to perform poorly when the data comes from a distribution different from the training one. In critical applications such as medical imaging, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps to identify such data samples, increasing the model's reliability. Recent works have developed DL-based OOD detection that achieves promising results on 2D medical images. However, scaling most of these approaches on 3D images is computationally intractable. Furthermore, the current 3D solutions struggle to achieve acceptable results in detecting even synthetic OOD samples. Such limited performance might indicate that DL often inefficiently embeds large volumetric images. We argue that using the intensity histogram of the original CT or MRI scan as embedding is descriptive enough to run OOD detection. Therefore, we propose a histogram-based method that requires no DL and achieves almost perfect results in this domain. Our proposal is supported two-fold. We evaluate the performance on the publicly available datasets, where our method scores 1.0 AUROC in most setups. And we score second in the Medical Out-of-Distribution challenge without fine-tuning and exploiting task-specific knowledge. Carefully discussing the limitations, we conclude that our method solves the sample-level OOD detection on 3D medical images in the current setting. ",

    "title": "AdvMIL: Adversarial Multiple Instance Learning for the Survival Analysis  on Whole-Slide Images",
    "abstract": "The survival analysis on histological whole-slide images (WSIs) is one of the most important means to estimate patient prognosis. Although many weakly-supervised deep learning models have been developed for gigapixel WSIs, their potential is generally restricted by classical survival analysis rules and fully-supervision requirements. As a result, these models provide patients only with a completely-certain point estimation of time-to-event, and they could only learn from the well-annotated WSI data currently at a small scale. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel adversarial multiple instance learning (AdvMIL) framework. This framework is based on adversarial time-to-event modeling, and it integrates the multiple instance learning (MIL) that is much necessary for WSI representation learning. It is a plug-and-play one, so that most existing WSI-based models with embedding-level MIL networks can be easily upgraded by applying this framework, gaining the improved ability of survival distribution estimation and semi-supervised learning. Our extensive experiments show that AdvMIL could not only bring performance improvement to mainstream WSI models at a relatively low computational cost, but also enable these models to learn from unlabeled data with semi-supervised learning. Our AdvMIL framework could promote the research of time-to-event modeling in computational pathology with its novel paradigm of adversarial MIL. ",

    "title": "A Machine Learning Enhanced Approach for Automated Sunquake Detection in  Acoustic Emission Maps",
    "abstract": "Sunquakes are seismic emissions visible on the solar surface, associated with some solar flares. Although discovered in 1998, they have only recently become a more commonly detected phenomenon. Despite the availability of several manual detection guidelines, to our knowledge, the astrophysical data produced for sunquakes is new to the field of Machine Learning. Detecting sunquakes is a daunting task for human operators and this work aims to ease and, if possible, to improve their detection. Thus, we introduce a dataset constructed from acoustic egression-power maps of solar active regions obtained for Solar Cycles 23 and 24 using the holography method. We then present a pedagogical approach to the application of machine learning representation methods for sunquake detection using AutoEncoders, Contrastive Learning, Object Detection and recurrent techniques, which we enhance by introducing several custom domain-specific data augmentation transformations. We address the main challenges of the automated sunquake detection task, namely the very high noise patterns in and outside the active region shadow and the extreme class imbalance given by the limited number of frames that present sunquake signatures. With our trained models, we find temporal and spatial locations of peculiar acoustic emission and qualitatively associate them to eruptive and high energy emission. While noting that these models are still in a prototype stage and there is much room for improvement in metrics and bias levels, we hypothesize that their agreement on example use cases has the potential to enable detection of weak solar acoustic manifestations.

    "abstract": "Financial networks help firms manage risk but also enable financial shocks to spread. Despite their importance, existing models of financial networks have several limitations. Prior works often consider a static network with a simple structure (e.g., a ring) or a model that assumes conditional independence between edges. We propose a new model where the network emerges from interactions between heterogeneous utility-maximizing firms. Edges correspond to contract agreements between pairs of firms, with the contract size being the edge weight. We show that, almost always, there is a unique \"stable network.\" All edge weights in this stable network depend on all firms' beliefs. Furthermore, firms can find the stable network via iterative pairwise negotiations. When beliefs change, the stable network changes. We show that under realistic settings, a regulator cannot pin down the changed beliefs that caused the network changes. Also, each firm can use its view of the network to inform its beliefs. For instance, it can detect outlier firms whose beliefs deviate from their peers. But it cannot identify the deviant belief: increased risk-seeking is indistinguishable from increased expected profits. Seemingly minor news may settle the dilemma, triggering significant changes in the network. ",
