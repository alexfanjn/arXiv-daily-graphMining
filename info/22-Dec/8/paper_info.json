    "abstract": "The biomedical imaging world is notorious for working with small amounts of data, frustrating state-of-the-art efforts in the computer vision and deep learning worlds. With large datasets, it is easier to make progress we have seen from the natural image distribution. It is the same with microscopy videos of neuron cells moving in a culture. This problem presents several challenges as it can be difficult to grow and maintain the culture for days, and it is expensive to acquire the materials and equipment. In this work, we explore how to alleviate this data scarcity problem by synthesizing the videos. We, therefore, take the recent work of the video diffusion model to synthesize videos of cells from our training dataset. We then analyze the model's strengths and consistent shortcomings to guide us on improving video generation to be as high-quality as possible. To improve on such a task, we propose modifying the denoising function and adding motion information (dense optical flow) so that the model has more context regarding how video frames transition over time and how each pixel changes over time.

    "abstract": "Whole slide images (WSI) are microscopy images of stained tissue slides routinely prepared for diagnosis and treatment selection in medical practice. WSI are very large (gigapixel size) and complex (made of up to millions of cells). The current state-of-the-art (SoTA) approach to classify WSI subdivides them into tiles, encodes them by pre-trained networks and applies Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to train for specific downstream tasks. However, annotated datasets are often small, typically a few hundred to a few thousand WSI, which may cause overfitting and underperforming models. Conversely, the number of unannotated WSI is ever increasing, with datasets of tens of thousands (soon to be millions) of images available. While it has been previously proposed to use these unannotated data to identify suitable tile representations by self-supervised learning (SSL), downstream classification tasks still require full supervision because parts of the MIL architecture is not trained during tile level SSL pre-training. Here, we propose a strategy of slide level SSL to leverage the large number of WSI without annotations to infer powerful slide representations. Applying our method to The Cancer-Genome Atlas, one of the most widely used data resources in cancer research (16 TB image data), we are able to downsize the dataset to 23 MB without any loss in predictive power: we show that a linear classifier trained on top of these embeddings maintains or improves previous SoTA performances on various benchmark WSI classification tasks. Finally, we observe that training a classifier on these representations with tiny datasets (e.g. 50 slides) improved performances over SoTA by an average of +6.3 AUC points over all downstream tasks.

    "abstract": "Deformable image registration, i.e., the task of aligning multiple images into one coordinate system by non-linear transformation, serves as an essential preprocessing step for neuroimaging data. Recent research on deformable image registration is mainly focused on improving the registration accuracy using multi-stage alignment methods, where the source image is repeatedly deformed in stages by a same neural network until it is well-aligned with the target image. Conventional methods for multi-stage registration can often blur the source image as the pixel/voxel values are repeatedly interpolated from the image generated by the previous stage. However, maintaining image quality such as sharpness during image registration is crucial to medical data analysis. In this paper, we study the problem of anti-blur deformable image registration and propose a novel solution, called Anti-Blur Network (ABN), for multi-stage image registration. Specifically, we use a pair of short-term registration and long-term memory networks to learn the nonlinear deformations at each stage, where the short-term registration network learns how to improve the registration accuracy incrementally and the long-term memory network combines all the previous deformations to allow an interpolation to perform on the raw image directly and preserve image sharpness. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image datasets demonstrated that ABN can accurately register images while preserving their sharpness.

    "abstract": "Current pre-trained language models have enabled remarkable improvements in downstream tasks, but it remains difficult to distinguish effects of statistical correlation from more systematic logical reasoning grounded on understanding of the real world. In this paper we tease these factors apart by leveraging counterfactual conditionals, which force language models to predict unusual consequences based on hypothetical propositions. We introduce a set of tests drawn from psycholinguistic experiments, as well as larger-scale controlled datasets, to probe counterfactual predictions from a variety of popular pre-trained language models. We find that models are consistently able to override real-world knowledge in counterfactual scenarios, and that this effect is more robust in case of stronger baseline world knowledge -- however, we also find that for most models this effect appears largely to be driven by simple lexical cues. When we mitigate effects of both world knowledge and lexical cues to test knowledge of linguistic nuances of counterfactuals, we find that only GPT-3 shows sensitivity to these nuances, though this sensitivity is also non-trivially impacted by lexical associative factors.

The well-known Turing Test proposed to judge the ultimate validity of an artificial intelligence agent on the indistinguishability of its dialogues from humans'. It should come as no surprise that human-level dialogue systems are very challenging to build. But, while early effort on rule-based systems found limited success, the emergence of deep learning enabled great advance on this topic. In this thesis, we focus on methods that address the numerous issues that have been imposing the gap between artificial conversational agents and human-level interlocutors.

    "abstract": "Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) has been continuously evolving since Release 14 of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for future autonomous vehicles. Apart from automotive safety, 5G NR further bring new capabilities to C-V2X for autonomous driving, such as real-time local update, and coordinated driving. These capabilities rely on the provision of low latency and high reliability from 5G NR. Among them, a basic demand is broadcasting or multicasting environment update messages, such as cooperative perception data, with high reliability and low latency from a Road Side Unit (RSU) or a base station (BS). In other words, broadcasting multiple types of automotive messages with high reliability and low latency is one of the key issues in 5G NR C-V2X. In this work, we consider how to select Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS), RSU/BS, Forward Error Correction (FEC) code rate, to maximize the system utility, which is a function of message delivery reliability. We formulate the optimization problem as a nonlinear integer programming problem. Since the optimization problem is NP-hard, we propose an approximation algorithm, referred to as the Hyperbolic Successive Convex Approximation (HSCA) algorithm, which uses the successive convex approximation to find the optimal solution. In our simulations, we compare the performance of HSCA with those of three algorithms respectively, including the baseline algorithm, the heuristic algorithm, and the optimal solution. Our simulation results show that HSCA outperforms the baseline and the heuristic algorithms and is very competitive to the optimal solution. ",

We decomposed the task into multiple steps, using YOLOv4 to extract relevant regions of the video and a 3D sparse coding model to represent video features. Given the difficulty in acquiring positive training videos, we trained a small-data classifier with a maximum of 15 positive and 32 negative examples. To counteract this limitation, we leveraged subject matter expert (SME) knowledge to limit the hypothesis space, thus reducing the cost of data collection. We present results using two lung ultrasound datasets and demonstrate that our model is capable of achieving performance on par with SMEs in pneumothorax identification. We then developed an iOS application that runs our full system in less than 4 seconds on an iPad Pro, and less than 8 seconds on an iPhone 13 Pro, labeling key regions in the lung sonogram to provide interpretable diagnoses.

No a-priori assumptions are made on the stochastic environments and no temperature measurement is executed. The algorithms are unequivocally specified offline, without the need of tuning some parameters in dependence of the working conditions.

Various secure and privacy-preserving supervised learning algorithms with formal guarantees have been proposed to address these issues. However, they suffer from various limitations such as accuracy loss, small certified security guarantees, and/or inefficiency. Self-supervised learning is an emerging technique to pre-train encoders using unlabeled data. Given a pre-trained encoder as a feature extractor, supervised learning can train a simple yet accurate classifier using a small amount of labeled training data. In this work, we perform the first systematic, principled measurement study to understand whether and when a pre-trained encoder can address the limitations of secure or privacy-preserving supervised learning algorithms. Our key findings are that a pre-trained encoder substantially improves 1) both accuracy under no attacks and certified security guarantees against data poisoning and backdoor attacks of state-of-the-art secure learning algorithms (i.e., bagging and KNN), 2) certified security guarantees of randomized smoothing against adversarial examples without sacrificing its accuracy under no attacks, 3) accuracy of differentially private classifiers, and 4) accuracy and/or efficiency of exact machine unlearning.

However, these feature values do not represent the source code syntax styles or patterns that a developer might prefer over available valid alternatives provided by programming languages. This investigation proposed a method to extract features from its source code syntax patterns to represent software commits and investigate whether they are helpful in detecting bug proneness in software systems. We utilize six manually and two automatically labeled datasets from eight open-source software projects written in Java, C++, and Python programming languages. Our datasets contain 642 manually labeled and 4,014 automatically labeled buggy and non-buggy commits from six and two subject systems, respectively. The subject systems contain a diverse number of revisions, and they are from various application domains. Our investigation shows the inclusion of the proposed features increases the performance of detecting buggy and non-buggy software commits using five different machine learning classification models. Our proposed features also perform better in detecting buggy commits using the Deep Belief Network generated features and classification model.

This is achieved by using an MLP together with a mapping to a higher-dimensional space, and has been proven to capture scenes with a great level of detail.

A particularly interesting property in this regard is the semantic decomposition of the scene. We introduce a novel technique for semantic soft decomposition of neural radiance fields (named SSDNeRF) which jointly encodes semantic signals in combination with radiance signals of a scene. Our approach provides a soft decomposition of the scene into semantic parts, enabling us to correctly encode multiple semantic classes blending along the same direction -- an impossible feat for existing methods. Not only does this lead to a detailed, 3D semantic representation of the scene, but we also show that the regularizing effects of the MLP used for encoding help to improve the semantic representation. We show state-of-the-art segmentation and reconstruction results on a dataset of common objects and demonstrate how the proposed approach can be applied for high quality temporally consistent video editing and re-compositing on a dataset of casually captured selfie videos.

In this paper, we propose Slimmable Pruned Neural Networks (SP-Net), which has sub-network structures learned by pruning instead of adopting structures with the same proportion of channels in each layer (width multiplier) like S-Net, and we also propose new pruning procedures: multi-base pruning instead of one-shot or iterative pruning to realize high accuracy and huge training time saving. We also introduced slimmable channel sorting (scs) to achieve calculation as fast as S-Net and zero padding match (zpm) pruning to prune residual structure in more efficient way. SP-Net can be combined with any kind of channel pruning methods and does not require any complicated processing or time-consuming architecture search like NAS models.

This paper builds a Mandarin-English TTS system to acquire more standard spoken English speech from a monolingual Chinese speaker. We introduce phonology embedding to capture the English differences between different phonology. Embedding mask is applied to language embedding for distinguishing information between different languages and to phonology embedding for focusing on English expression. We specially design an embedding strength modulator to capture the dynamic strength of language and phonology. Experiments show that our approach can produce significantly more natural and standard spoken English speech of the monolingual Chinese speaker. From analysis, we find that suitable phonology control contributes to better performance in different scenarios. ",

    "title": "Dynamic Graph Node Classification via Time Augmentation",
    "abstract": "Node classification for graph-structured data aims to classify nodes whose labels are unknown. While studies on static graphs are prevalent, few studies have focused on dynamic graph node classification. Node classification on dynamic graphs is challenging for two reasons. First, the model needs to capture both structural and temporal information, particularly on dynamic graphs with a long history and require large receptive fields. Second, model scalability becomes a significant concern as the size of the dynamic graph increases. To address these problems, we propose the Time Augmented Dynamic Graph Neural Network (TADGNN) framework. TADGNN consists of two modules: 1) a time augmentation module that captures the temporal evolution of nodes across time structurally, creating a time-augmented spatio-temporal graph, and 2) an information propagation module that learns the dynamic representations for each node across time using the constructed time-augmented graph. We perform node classification experiments on four dynamic graph benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that TADGNN framework outperforms several static and dynamic state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN models while demonstrating superior scalability. We also conduct theoretical and empirical analyses to validate the efficiency of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://sites.google.com/view/tadgnn. ",

    "abstract": "Tens of thousands of engineers use Sourcegraph day-to-day to search for code and rely on it to make progress on software development tasks. We face a key challenge in designing a query language that accommodates the needs of a broad spectrum of users. Our experience shows that users express different and often contradictory preferences for how queries should be interpreted. These preferences stem from users with differing usage contexts, technical experience, and implicit expectations from using prior tools. At the same time, designing a code search query language poses unique challenges because it intersects traditional search engines and full-fledged programming languages. For example, code search queries adopt certain syntactic conventions in the interest of simplicity and terseness but invariably risk encoding implicit semantics that are ambiguous at face-value (a single space in a query could mean three or more semantically different things depending on surrounding terms). Users often need to disambiguate intent with additional syntax so that a query expresses what they actually want to search. This need to disambiguate is one of the primary frustrations we've seen users experience with writing search queries in the last three years. We share our observations that lead us to a fresh perspective where code search behavior can straddle seemingly ambiguous queries. We develop Automated Query Evaluation (AQE), a new technique that automatically generates and adaptively runs alternative query interpretations in frustration-prone conditions. We evaluate AQE with an A/B test across more than 10,000 unique users on our publicly-available code search instance. Our main result shows that relative to the control group, users are on average 22% more likely to click on a search result at all on any given day when AQE is active. ",

Like other deep learning (DL) methods, GNNs are being deployed in sophisticated modern hardware systems, as well as dedicated accelerators. However, despite the popularity of GNNs and the recent efforts of bringing GNNs to hardware, the fault tolerance and resilience of GNNs has generally been overlooked. Inspired by the inherent algorithmic resilience of DL methods, this paper conducts, for the first time, a large-scale and empirical study of GNN resilience, aiming to understand the relationship between hardware faults and GNN accuracy. By developing a customized fault injection tool on top of PyTorch, we perform extensive fault injection experiments to various GNN models and application datasets. We observe that the error resilience of GNN models varies by orders of magnitude with respect to different models and application datasets. Further, we explore a low-cost error mitigation mechanism for GNN to enhance its resilience. This GNN resilience study aims to open up new directions and opportunities for future GNN accelerator design and architectural optimization. ",

    "abstract": "Script event prediction aims to predict the subsequent event given the context. This requires the capability to infer the correlations between events. Recent works have attempted to improve event correlation reasoning by using pretrained language models and incorporating external knowledge~(e.g., discourse relations). Though promising results have been achieved, some challenges still remain. First, the pretrained language models adopted by current works ignore event-level knowledge, resulting in an inability to capture the correlations between events well. Second, modeling correlations between events with discourse relations is limited because it can only capture explicit correlations between events with discourse markers, and cannot capture many implicit correlations. To this end, we propose a novel generative approach for this task, in which a pretrained language model is fine-tuned with an event-centric pretraining objective and predicts the next event within a generative paradigm. Specifically, we first introduce a novel event-level blank infilling strategy as the learning objective to inject event-level knowledge into the pretrained language model, and then design a likelihood-based contrastive loss for fine-tuning the generative model. Instead of using an additional prediction layer, we perform prediction by using sequence likelihoods generated by the generative model. Our approach models correlations between events in a soft way without any external knowledge. The likelihood-based prediction eliminates the need to use additional networks to make predictions and is somewhat interpretable since it scores each word in the event. Experimental results on the multi-choice narrative cloze~(MCNC) task demonstrate that our approach achieves better results than other state-of-the-art baselines.

While arbitrary scale DSR is a more realistic setting in this scenario, previous approaches predominantly suffer from the issue of inefficient real-numbered scale upsampling.

The heart of this representation is our proposed Geometric Spatial Aggregator (GSA), which exploits a distance field modulated by arbitrarily upsampled target gridding, through which the geometric information is explicitly introduced into feature aggregation and target generation. Furthermore, bricking with GSA, we present a transformer-style backbone named GeoDSR, which possesses a principled way to construct the functional mapping between local coordinates and the high-resolution output results, empowering our model with the advantage of arbitrary shape transformation ready to help diverse zooming demand. Extensive experimental results on standard depth map benchmarks, e.g., NYU v2, have demonstrated that the proposed framework achieves significant restoration gain in arbitrary scale depth map super-resolution compared with the prior art.

    "abstract": "Network pruning is a promising way to generate light but accurate models and enable their deployment on resource-limited edge devices. However, the current state-of-the-art assumes that the effective sub-network and the other superfluous parameters in the given network share the same distribution, where pruning inevitably involves a distribution truncation operation. They usually eliminate values near zero. While simple, it may not be the most appropriate method, as effective models may naturally have many small values associated with them. Removing near-zero values already embedded in model space may significantly reduce model accuracy. Another line of work has proposed to assign discrete prior over all possible sub-structures that still rely on human-crafted prior hypotheses. Worse still, existing methods use regularized point estimates, namely Hard Pruning, that can not provide error estimations and fail reliability justification for the pruned networks. In this paper, we propose a novel distribution-lossless pruning method, named DLLP, to theoretically find the pruned lottery within Bayesian treatment. Specifically, DLLP remodels the vanilla networks as discrete priors for the latent pruned model and the other redundancy. More importantly, DLLP uses Stein Variational Inference to approach the latent prior and effectively bypasses calculating KL divergence with unknown distribution. Extensive experiments based on small Cifar-10 and large-scaled ImageNet demonstrate that our method can obtain sparser networks with great generalization performance while providing quantified reliability for the pruned model.

To solve the problem, we propose a novel Graph Contrastive Clustering method with the Learnable graph Data Augmentation (GCC-LDA), which is optimized completely by the neural networks. An adversarial learning mechanism is designed to keep cross-view consistency in the latent space while ensuring the diversity of augmented views. In our framework, a structure augmentor and an attribute augmentor are constructed for augmentation learning in both structure level and attribute level. To improve the reliability of the learned affinity matrix, clustering is introduced to the learning procedure and the learned affinity matrix is refined with both the high-confidence pseudo-label matrix and the cross-view sample similarity matrix. During the training procedure, to provide persistent optimization for the learned view, we design a two-stage training strategy to obtain more reliable clustering information.

    "abstract": "Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)-based models have become popular foundation models to solve many time-series problems. Combining neural ODEs with traditional RNN models has provided the best representation for irregular time series. However, ODE-based models require the trajectory of hidden states to be defined based on the initial observed value or the last available observation. This fact raises questions about how long the generated hidden state is sufficient and whether it is effective when long sequences are used instead of the typically used shorter sequences. In this article, we introduce CrossPyramid, a novel ODE-based model that aims to enhance the generalizability of sequences representation. CrossPyramid does not rely only on the hidden state from the last observed value; it also considers ODE latent representations learned from other samples. The main idea of our proposed model is to define the hidden state for the unobserved values based on the non-linear correlation between samples. Accordingly, CrossPyramid is built with three distinctive parts: (1) ODE Auto-Encoder to learn the best data representation. (2) Pyramidal attention method to categorize the learned representations (hidden state) based on the relationship characteristics between samples. (3) Cross-level ODE-RNN to integrate the previously learned information and provide the final latent state for each sample. Through extensive experiments on partially-observed synthetic and real-world datasets, we show that the proposed architecture can effectively model the long gaps in intermittent series and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The results show an average improvement of 10\\% on univariate and multivariate datasets for both forecasting and classification tasks. ",

While graph neural network (GNN)-based models are effective at learning to simulate complex physical dynamics, such as fluids, cloth and articulated bodies, they have been less effective and efficient on rigid-body physics, except with very simple shapes. Existing methods that model collisions through the meshes' nodes are often inaccurate because they struggle when collisions occur on faces far from nodes. Alternative approaches that represent the geometry densely with many particles are prohibitively expensive for complex shapes. Here we introduce the Face Interaction Graph Network (FIGNet) which extends beyond GNN-based methods, and computes interactions between mesh faces, rather than nodes. Compared to learned node- and particle-based methods, FIGNet is around 4x more accurate in simulating complex shape interactions, while also 8x more computationally efficient on sparse, rigid meshes. Moreover, FIGNet can learn frictional dynamics directly from real-world data, and can be more accurate than analytical solvers given modest amounts of training data. FIGNet represents a key step forward in one of the few remaining physical domains which have seen little competition from learned simulators, and offers allied fields such as robotics, graphics and mechanical design a new tool for simulation and model-based planning.

In fact, as opposed to regular Android apps, mobile browsers may present contradicting privacy behaviors. On the one end, they can have access to (and can expose) a unique combination of sensitive user data, from users' browsing history to permission-protected personally identifiable information (PII) such as unique identifiers and geolocation. However, on the other end, they also are in a unique position to protect users' privacy by limiting data sharing with other parties by implementing ad-blocking features. In this paper, we perform a comparative and empirical analysis on how hundreds of Android web browsers protect or expose user data during browsing sessions. To this end, we collect the largest dataset of Android browsers to date, from the Google Play Store and four Chinese app stores. Then, we developed a novel analysis pipeline that combines static and dynamic analysis methods to find a wide range of privacy-enhancing (e.g., ad-blocking) and privacy-harming behaviors (e.g., sending browsing histories to third parties, not validating TLS certificates, and exposing PII -- including non-resettable identifiers -- to third parties) across browsers. We find that various popular apps on both Google Play and Chinese stores have these privacy-harming behaviors, including apps that claim to be privacy-enhancing in their descriptions. Overall, our study not only provides new insights into important yet overlooked considerations for browsers' adoption and transparency, but also that automatic app analysis systems (e.g., sandboxes) need context-specific analysis to reveal such privacy behaviors.

    "abstract": "Most recent head pose estimation (HPE) methods are dominated by the Euler angle representation. To avoid its inherent ambiguity problem of rotation labels, alternative quaternion-based and vector-based representations are introduced. However, they both are not visually intuitive, and often derived from equivocal Euler angle labels. In this paper, we present a novel single-stage keypoint-based method via an {\\it intuitive} and {\\it unconstrained} 2D cube representation for joint head detection and pose estimation. The 2D cube is an orthogonal projection of the 3D regular hexahedron label roughly surrounding one head, and itself contains the head location. It can reflect the head orientation straightforwardly and unambiguously in any rotation angle. Unlike the general 6-DoF object pose estimation, our 2D cube ignores the 3-DoF of head size but retains the 3-DoF of head pose. Based on the prior of equal side length, we can effortlessly obtain the closed-form solution of Euler angles from predicted 2D head cube instead of applying the error-prone PnP algorithm. In experiments, our proposed method achieves comparable results with other representative methods on the public AFLW2000 and BIWI datasets. Besides, a novel test on the CMU panoptic dataset shows that our method can be seamlessly adapted to the unconstrained full-view HPE task without modification. ",

This paper proposes an original and in-depth evaluation study of recent unsupervised anomaly detection techniques in time-series. Instead of relying solely on standard performance metrics, additional yet informative metrics and protocols are taken into account. In particular, (1) more elaborate performance metrics specifically tailored for time-series are used; (2) the model size and the model stability are studied; (3) an analysis of the tested approaches with respect to the anomaly type is provided; and (4) a clear and unique protocol is followed for all experiments. Overall, this extensive analysis aims to assess the maturity of state-of-the-art time-series anomaly detection, give insights regarding their applicability under real-world setups and provide to the community a more complete evaluation protocol.

In general, since the real-world graphs are often a complex mixture of diverse subgraph patterns, learning a universal spectral filter on the graph from the global perspective as in most current works may still suffer from great difficulty in adapting to the variation of local patterns. On the basis of the theoretical analysis on local patterns, we rethink the existing spectral filtering methods and propose the \\textbf{\\underline{N}}ode-oriented spectral \\textbf{\\underline{F}}iltering for \\textbf{\\underline{G}}raph \\textbf{\\underline{N}}eural \\textbf{\\underline{N}}etwork (namely NFGNN). By estimating the node-oriented spectral filter for each node, NFGNN is provided with the capability of precise local node positioning via the generalized translated operator, thus discriminating the variations of local homophily patterns adaptively. Meanwhile, the utilization of re-parameterization brings a good trade-off between global consistency and local sensibility for learning the node-oriented spectral filters. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the localization property of NFGNN, demonstrating that the signal after adaptive filtering is still positioned around the corresponding node. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed NFGNN achieves more favorable performance. ",

    "abstract": "Human civilization has an increasingly powerful influence on the earth system. Affected by climate change and land-use change, natural disasters such as flooding have been increasing in recent years. Earth observations are an invaluable source for assessing and mitigating negative impacts. Detecting changes from Earth observation data is one way to monitor the possible impact. Effective and reliable Change Detection (CD) methods can help in identifying the risk of disaster events at an early stage. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised CD method on time series Synthetic Aperture Radar~(SAR) data. Our proposed method is a probabilistic model trained with unsupervised learning techniques, reconstruction, and contrastive learning. The change map is generated with the help of the distribution difference between pre-incident and post-incident data. Our proposed CD model is evaluated on flood detection data. We verified the efficacy of our model on 8 different flood sites, including three recent flood events from Copernicus Emergency Management Services and six from the Sen1Floods11 dataset. Our proposed model achieved an average of 64.53\\% Intersection Over Union(IoU) value and 75.43\\% F1 score. Our achieved IoU score is approximately 6-27\\% and F1 score is approximately 7-22\\% better than the compared unsupervised and supervised existing CD methods. The results and extensive discussion presented in the study show the effectiveness of the proposed unsupervised CD method. ",

These automatic and professional-skill-free face manipulation technologies can be used to replace the face in an original image or video with any target object while maintaining the expression and demeanor. Since human faces are closely related to identity characteristics, maliciously disseminated identity manipulated videos could trigger a crisis of public trust in the media and could even have serious political, social, and legal implications. To effectively detect manipulated videos, we focus on the position offset in the face blending process, resulting from the forced affine transformation of the normalized forged face. We introduce a method for detecting manipulated videos that is based on the trajectory of the facial region displacement. Specifically, we develop a virtual-anchor-based method for extracting the facial trajectory, which can robustly represent displacement information. This information was used to construct a network for exposing multidimensional artifacts in the trajectory sequences of manipulated videos that is based on dual-stream spatial-temporal graph attention and a gated recurrent unit backbone. Testing of our method on various manipulation datasets demonstrated that its accuracy and generalization ability is competitive with that of the leading detection methods. ",

With this motivation, we apply transformer based model for learning contextual representation of products in an e-commerce setting. In this work, we propose a novel approach of pre-training transformer based model on a users generated sessions dataset obtained from a large fashion e-commerce platform to obtain latent product representation. Once pre-trained, we show that the low-dimension representation of the products can be obtained given the product attributes information as a textual sentence. We mainly pre-train BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT and XLNET variants of transformer model and show a quantitative analysis of the products representation obtained from these models with respect to Next Product Recommendation(NPR) and Content Ranking(CR) tasks. For both the tasks, we collect an evaluation data from the fashion e-commerce platform and observe that XLNET model outperform other variants with a MRR of 0.5 for NPR and NDCG of 0.634 for CR. XLNET model also outperforms the Word2Vec based non-transformer baseline on both the downstream tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and novel work for pre-training transformer based models using users generated sessions data containing products that are represented with rich attributes information for adoption in e-commerce setting. These models can be further fine-tuned in order to solve various downstream tasks in e-commerce, thereby eliminating the need to train a model from scratch. ",

It has a total of 8 hours 3D motioncapture human dances with paired music, and 16 different dance genres. To the best of our knowledge, MagicDance is the 3D dance dataset with the most genres.

Based on this observation, we also propose a generation-synthesis choreography network (MagicNet), which cascades a Diffusion-based 3D Diverse Dance fragments Generation Network (3DGNet) and a Genre&Coherent aware Retrieval Module (GCRM). The former can generate various dance fragments from only one music clip. The latter is utilized to select the best dance fragment generated by 3DGNet and switch them into a complete dance according to the genre and coherent matching score.

While its versatile usability has been widely investigated in many domains, its applications to recommender systems still remain underexplored. We show that language modeling applied directly to task-specific user histories achieves excellent results on diverse recommendation tasks.

In particular, we introduce the \\emph{GenFlow} algorithm and its momentum variant that provably converge to the optimal solution of objective functions satisfying the Polyak-{\\L}ojasiewicz (PL) inequality, in a fixed-time. Moreover for functions that admit non-degenerate saddle-points, we show that for the proposed GenFlow algorithm, the time required to evade these saddle-points is bounded uniformly for all initial conditions. Finally, for strongly convex-strongly concave minimax problems whose optimal solution is a saddle point, a similar scheme is shown to arrive at the optimal solution again in a fixed-time. The superior convergence properties of our algorithm are validated experimentally on a variety of benchmark datasets. ",

Energy measurements from smart meters represent hourly mean power, while voltage measurements are instantaneous with uneven time intervals. Thus, measurements are not synchronous, which poses a major challenge for grid analysis. The proposed method focuses on daily mean, minimum, and maximum voltage and results show that deviations in daily minimum voltage are the most useful ones.

The experimental analysis confirms that RADAR is able to $(i)$ match samples to multiple different TTPs, and $(ii)$ effectively detect malware with an AUC score of 0.868. Beside being effective, RADAR is also highly configurable, interpretable, privacy preserving, efficient and can be easily integrated with existing security infrastructure to complement their capabilities.

A state-space model of the hybrid PV plant is first derived, based on which an adaptive model predictive controller is designed. The controller's objective is to control the PV and BESS to follow power setpoints sent to the the hybrid system while maintaining desired power reserves and meeting system operational constraints. Furthermore, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is implemented for estimating the battery SOC, and an error sensitivity is executed to assess its limitations. To validate the proposed strategy, detailed EMT models of the hybrid system are developed so that losses and control limits can be quantified accurately. Day-long simulations are performed in an OPAL-RT real-time simulator using second-by-second actual PV farm data as inputs. Results verify that the proposed method can follow power setpoints while maintaining power reserves in days of high irradiance intermittency even with a small BESS storage. ",

    "abstract": "Motion prediction systems aim to capture the future behavior of traffic scenarios enabling autonomous vehicles to perform safe and efficient planning. The evolution of these scenarios is highly uncertain and depends on the interactions of agents with static and dynamic objects in the scene. GNN-based approaches have recently gained attention as they are well suited to naturally model these interactions. However, one of the main challenges that remains unexplored is how to address the complexity and opacity of these models in order to deal with the transparency requirements for autonomous driving systems, which includes aspects such as interpretability and explainability. In this work, we aim to improve the explainability of motion prediction systems by using different approaches. First, we propose a new Explainable Heterogeneous Graph-based Policy (XHGP) model based on an heterograph representation of the traffic scene and lane-graph traversals, which learns interaction behaviors using object-level and type-level attention. This learned attention provides information about the most important agents and interactions in the scene. Second, we explore this same idea with the explanations provided by GNNExplainer. Third, we apply counterfactual reasoning to provide explanations of selected individual scenarios by exploring the sensitivity of the trained model to changes made to the input data, i.e., masking some elements of the scene, modifying trajectories, and adding or removing dynamic agents. The explainability analysis provided in this paper is a first step towards more transparent and reliable motion prediction systems, important from the perspective of the user, developers and regulatory agencies.

    "title": "Robustness of Learning from Task Instructions",
    "abstract": "Traditional supervised learning mostly works on individual tasks and requires training on a large set of task-specific examples. This paradigm seriously hinders the development of task generalization since preparing a task-specific example set is costly. To build a system that can quickly and easily generalize to new tasks, task instructions have been adopted as an emerging trend of supervision recently. These instructions give the model the definition of the task and allow the model to output the appropriate answer based on the instructions and inputs. However, task instructions are often expressed in different forms, which can be interpreted from two threads: first, some instructions are short sentences and are pretrained language model (PLM) oriented, such as prompts, while other instructions are paragraphs and are human-oriented, such as those in Amazon MTurk; second, different end-users very likely explain the same task with instructions of different textual expressions. A robust system for task generalization should be able to handle any new tasks regardless of the variability of instructions. However, the system robustness in dealing with instruction-driven task generalization is still unexplored. This work investigates the system robustness when the instructions of new tasks are (i) maliciously manipulated, (ii) paraphrased, or (iii) from different levels of conciseness. To our knowledge, this is the first work that systematically studies how robust a PLM is when it is supervised by instructions with different factors of variability. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, spoken dialogue systems have been widely deployed in a variety of applications, serving a huge number of end-users. A common issue is that the errors resulting from noisy utterances, semantic misunderstandings, or lack of knowledge make it hard for a real system to respond properly, possibly leading to an unsatisfactory user experience. To avoid such a case, we consider a proactive interaction mechanism where the system predicts the user satisfaction with the candidate response before giving it to the user. If the user is not likely to be satisfied according to the prediction, the system will ask the user a suitable question to determine the real intent of the user instead of providing the response directly. With such an interaction with the user, the system can give a better response to the user. Previous models that predict the user satisfaction are not applicable to DuerOS which is a large-scale commercial dialogue system. They are based on hand-crafted features and thus can hardly learn the complex patterns lying behind millions of conversations and temporal dependency in multiple turns of the conversation. Moreover, they are trained and evaluated on the benchmark datasets with adequate labels, which are expensive to obtain in a commercial dialogue system. To face these challenges, we propose a pipeline to predict the user satisfaction to help DuerOS decide whether to ask for clarification in each turn. Specifically, we propose to first generate a large number of weak labels and then train a transformer-based model to predict the user satisfaction with these weak labels. Empirically, we deploy and evaluate our model on DuerOS, and observe a 19% relative improvement on the accuracy of user satisfaction prediction and 2.3% relative improvement on user experience. ",

    "abstract": "Domain adaptation is one of the prominent strategies for handling both domain shift, that is widely encountered in large-scale land use/land cover map calculation, and the scarcity of pixel-level ground truth that is crucial for supervised semantic segmentation. Studies focusing on adversarial domain adaptation via re-styling source domain samples, commonly through generative adversarial networks, have reported varying levels of success, yet they suffer from semantic inconsistencies, visual corruptions, and often require a large number of target domain samples. In this letter, we propose a new unsupervised domain adaptation method for the semantic segmentation of very high resolution images, that i) leads to semantically consistent and noise-free images, ii) operates with a single target domain sample (i.e. one-shot) and iii) at a fraction of the number of parameters required from state-of-the-art methods. More specifically an image-to-image translation paradigm is proposed, based on an encoder-decoder principle where latent content representations are mixed across domains, and a perceptual network module and loss function is further introduced to enforce semantic consistency. Cross-city comparative experiments have shown that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.

Predicting these classes from data remains an essential open challenge in computational physics at which existing time-series classification methods struggle. Here, we propose, \\texttt{phase2vec}, an embedding method that learns high-quality, physically-meaningful representations of 2D dynamical systems without supervision. Our embeddings are produced by a convolutional backbone that extracts geometric features from flow data and minimizes a physically-informed vector field reconstruction loss. In an auxiliary training period, embeddings are optimized so that they robustly encode the equations of unseen data over and above the performance of a per-equation fitting method. The trained architecture can not only predict the equations of unseen data, but also, crucially, learns embeddings that respect the underlying semantics of the embedded physical systems. We validate the quality of learned embeddings investigating the extent to which physical categories of input data can be decoded from embeddings compared to standard blackbox classifiers and state-of-the-art time series classification techniques. We find that our embeddings encode important physical properties of the underlying data, including the stability of fixed points, conservation of energy, and the incompressibility of flows, with greater fidelity than competing methods. We finally apply our embeddings to the analysis of meteorological data, showing we can detect climatically meaningful features. Collectively, our results demonstrate the viability of embedding approaches for the discovery of dynamical features in physical systems. ",

State-of-the-art Earth system models can provide detailed insight into these impacts, but have a large associated computational cost on a per-scenario basis. This large computational burden has driven recent interest in developing cheap machine learning models for the task of climate model emulation. In this manuscript, we explore the efficacy of randomly wired neural networks for this task. We describe how they can be constructed and compare them to their standard feedforward counterparts using the ClimateBench dataset. Specifically, we replace the serially connected dense layers in multilayer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks, and convolutional long short-term memory networks with randomly wired dense layers and assess the impact on model performance for models with 1 million and 10 million parameters. We find average performance improvements of 4.2% across model complexities and prediction tasks, with substantial performance improvements of up to 16.4% in some cases. Furthermore, we find no significant difference in prediction speed between networks with standard feedforward dense layers and those with randomly wired layers. These findings indicate that randomly wired neural networks may be suitable direct replacements for traditional dense layers in many standard models. ",

Specifically, we design a multi-channel input and multiple outputs architecture to predict the direction-of-arrival based embeddings and beamforming weights for each source. The precisely estimated directional embedding provides quite effective spatial discrimination guidance for the neural beamformer to offset the effect of phase wrapping, thus allowing more accurate reconstruction of two sources' speech signals. Experiments show that our proposed MIMO-DBnet not only achieves a comprehensive decent improvement compared to baseline systems, but also maintain the performance on high frequency bands when phase wrapping occurs.

The state-of-the-art for training classification BNNs restricted to few-shot learning is based on a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) approach. This paper proposes the BeMi ensemble, a structured architecture of BNNs based on training a single BNN for each possible pair of classes and applying a majority voting scheme to predict the final output. The training of a single BNN discriminating between two classes is achieved by a MIP model that optimizes a lexicographic multi-objective function according to robustness and simplicity principles. This approach results in training networks whose output is not affected by small perturbations on the input and whose number of active weights is as small as possible, while good accuracy is preserved. We computationally validate our model using the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets using up to 40 training images per class. Our structured ensemble outperforms both BNNs trained by stochastic gradient descent and state-of-the-art MIP-based approaches. While the previous approaches achieve an average accuracy of 51.1% on the MNIST dataset, the BeMi ensemble achieves an average accuracy of 61.7% when trained with 10 images per class and 76.4% when trained with 40 images per class.

In this work we consider the violation of the classical no-interference assumption, meaning that the treatment of one individuals might affect the outcomes of another. To make interference tractable, we consider a known network that describes how interference may travel. However, unlike previous work in this area, the radius (and intensity) of the interference experienced by a unit is unknown and can depend on different sub-networks of those treated and untreated that are connected to this unit. We study estimators for the average direct treatment effect on the treated in such a setting. The proposed estimator builds upon a Lepski-like procedure that searches over the possible relevant radii and treatment assignment patterns. In contrast to previous work, the proposed procedure aims to approximate the relevant network interference patterns. We establish oracle inequalities and corresponding adaptive rates for the estimation of the interference function. We leverage such estimates to propose and analyze two estimators for the average direct treatment effect on the treated. We address several challenges steaming from the data-driven creation of the patterns (i.e. feature engineering) and the network dependence. In addition to rates of convergence, under mild regularity conditions, we show that one of the proposed estimators is asymptotically normal and unbiased. ",

Given that neural variance alone does not uniquely determine a latent dynamical system, interpretable architectures should prioritize accurate and low-dimensional latent dynamics. In this work, we evaluated the performance of sequential autoencoders (SAEs) in recovering three latent chaotic attractors from simulated neural datasets. We found that SAEs with widely-used recurrent neural network (RNN)-based dynamics were unable to infer accurate rates at the true latent state dimensionality, and that larger RNNs relied upon dynamical features not present in the data. On the other hand, SAEs with neural ordinary differential equation (NODE)-based dynamics inferred accurate rates at the true latent state dimensionality, while also recovering latent trajectories and fixed point structure. We attribute this finding to the fact that NODEs allow use of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) of arbitrary capacity to model the vector field. Decoupling the expressivity of the dynamics model from its latent dimensionality enables NODEs to learn the requisite low-D dynamics where RNN cells fail. The suboptimal interpretability of widely-used RNN-based dynamics may motivate substitution for alternative architectures, such as NODE, that enable learning of accurate dynamics in low-dimensional latent spaces.

Link streams model numerous datasets and their proper study is crucial in many applications. In practice, raw link streams are often aggregated or transformed into time series or graphs where decisions are made. Yet, it remains unclear how the dynamical and structural information of a raw link stream carries into the transformed object. This work shows that it is possible to shed light into this question by studying link streams via algebraically linear graph and signal operators, for which we introduce a novel linear matrix framework for the analysis of link streams. We show that, due to their linearity, most methods in signal processing can be easily adopted by our framework to analyze the time/frequency information of link streams. However, the availability of linear graph methods to analyze relational/structural information is limited. We address this limitation by developing (i) a new basis for graphs that allow us to decompose them into structures at different resolution levels; and (ii) filters for graphs that allow us to change their structural information in a controlled manner. By plugging-in these developments and their time-domain counterpart into our framework, we are able to (i) obtain a new basis for link streams that allow us to represent them in a frequency-structure domain; and (ii) show that many interesting transformations to link streams, like the aggregation of interactions or their embedding into a euclidean space, can be seen as simple filters in our frequency-structure domain.
