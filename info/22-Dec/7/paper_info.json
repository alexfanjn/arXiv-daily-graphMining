    "abstract": "Representing relevant information of a traffic scene and understanding its environment is crucial for the success of autonomous driving. Modeling the surrounding of an autonomous car using semantic relations, i.e., how different traffic participants relate in the context of traffic rule based behaviors, is hardly been considered in previous work. This stems from the fact that these relations are hard to extract from real-world traffic scenes. In this work, we model traffic scenes in a form of spatial semantic scene graphs for various different predictions about the traffic participants, e.g., acceleration and deceleration. Our learning and inference approach uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and shows that incorporating explicit information about the spatial semantic relations between traffic participants improves the predicdtion results. Specifically, the acceleration prediction of traffic participants is improved by up to 12% compared to the baselines, which do not exploit this explicit information. Furthermore, by including additional information about previous scenes, we achieve 73% improvements. ",

    "abstract": "Due to the unequivocal need for understanding the decision processes of deep learning networks, both modal-dependent and model-agnostic techniques have become very popular. Although both of these ideas provide transparency for automated decision making, most methodologies focus on either using the modal-gradients (model-dependent) or ignoring the model internal states and reasoning with a model's behavior/outcome (model-agnostic) to instances. In this work, we propose a unified explanation approach that given an instance combines both model-dependent and agnostic explanations to produce an explanation set. The generated explanations are not only consistent in the neighborhood of a sample but can highlight causal relationships between image content and the outcome. We use Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) domain to illustrate the effectiveness of our explanations. The saliency maps generated by our approach are comparable or better on the softmax information score. ",

This paper proposes a method by combining the idea of few-shot learning and domain adaptation to deal with this problem. In the proposed method, an encoder, learned by optimizing a representation loss and an adversarial loss, is used to extract the relation of sentences in the source and target domain. The representation loss, including a cross-entropy loss and a contrastive loss, makes the encoder extract the relation of the source domain and keep the geometric structure of the classes in the source domain. And the adversarial loss is used to merge the source domain and target domain. The experimental results on the benchmark FewRel dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform some state-of-the-art methods. ",

We propose a deepfake detection methodology that eliminates the need for any real data by making use of synthetically generated data using StyleGAN3.

    "abstract": "Pandemic(epidemic) modeling, aiming at disease spreading analysis, has always been a popular research topic especially following the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2019. Some representative models including SIR-based deep learning prediction models have shown satisfactory performance. However, one major drawback for them is that they fall short in their long-term predictive ability. Although graph convolutional networks (GCN) also perform well, their edge representations do not contain complete information and it can lead to biases. Another drawback is that they usually use input features which they are unable to predict. Hence, those models are unable to predict further future. We propose a model that can propagate predictions further into the future and it has better edge representations. In particular, we model the pandemic as a spatial-temporal graph whose edges represent the transition of infections and are learned by our model. We use a two-stream framework that contains GCN and recursive structures (GRU) with an attention mechanism. Our model enables mobility analysis that provides an effective toolbox for public health researchers and policy makers to predict how different lock-down strategies that actively control mobility can influence the spread of pandemics. Experiments show that our model outperforms others in its long-term predictive power. Moreover, we simulate the effects of certain policies and predict their impacts on infection control. ",

We combine the implicit quantile and input time series representations to directly forecast multiple quantile estimations for multiple horizons jointly. Prior works have adopted a Linear layer for the direct estimation of all forecasting horizons in a multi-task learning setup. We show that following similar intuition from multi-task learning to exploit correlations among forecast horizons, we can model multiple quantile estimates as auxiliary tasks for each of the forecast horizon to improve forecast accuracy across the quantile estimates compared to modeling only a single quantile estimate. We show learning auxiliary quantile tasks leads to state-of-the-art performance on deterministic forecasting benchmarks concerning the main-task of forecasting the 50$^{th}$ percentile estimate. ",

The implementation and usage of hydraulic systems have been well documented; however, today, this still faces a challenge, the integration of tools that allow more accurate information about the functioning and operation of these systems for proactive decision-making. In industrial applications, many sensors and methods exist to measure and determine the status of process variables (e.g., flow, pressure, force). Nevertheless, little has been done to have systems that can provide users with device-health information related to hydraulic devices integrated into the machinery. Implementing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and machine learning (ML) models in hydraulic system components has been identified as a solution to the challenge many industries currently face: optimizing processes and carrying them out more safely and efficiently. This paper presents a solution for the characterization and estimation of anomalies in one of the most versatile and used devices in hydraulic systems, cylinders. AI and ML models were implemented to determine the current operating status of these hydraulic components and whether they are working correctly or if a failure mode or abnormal condition is present.

Such graphs play a key role for many downstream tasks, including clustering, classification, graph learning, and nearest neighbor search. For these tasks, it is critical to build graphs which are sparse yet still representative of the underlying data. The benefits of sparsity are twofold: firstly, constructing dense graphs is infeasible in practice for large datasets, and secondly, the runtime of downstream tasks is directly influenced by the sparsity of the similarity graph. In this work, we present $\\textit{Stars}$: a highly scalable method for building extremely sparse graphs via two-hop spanners, which are graphs where similar points are connected by a path of length at most two. Stars can construct two-hop spanners with significantly fewer similarity comparisons, which are a major bottleneck for learning based models where comparisons are expensive to evaluate. Theoretically, we demonstrate that Stars builds a graph in nearly-linear time, where approximate nearest neighbors are contained within two-hop neighborhoods. In practice, we have deployed Stars for multiple data sets allowing for graph building at the $\\textit{Tera-Scale}$, i.e., for graphs with tens of trillions of edges. We evaluate the performance of Stars for clustering and graph learning, and demonstrate 10~1000-fold improvements in pairwise similarity comparisons compared to different baselines, and 2~10-fold improvement in running time without quality loss.

Additionally, we present an anomaly explanation method based on AIDA, the \\textit{Tempered Isolation-based eXplanation (TIX)} algorithm, which finds the most relevant outlier features even in data sets with hundreds of dimensions. We test both algorithms on synthetic and empirical data: we show that AIDA is competitive when compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and it is superior in finding outliers hidden in multidimensional feature subspaces. Finally, we illustrate how the TIX algorithm is able to find outliers in multidimensional feature subspaces, and use these explanations to analyze common benchmarks used in anomaly detection. ",

By measuring the gap in accuracy on the highest and lowest ranked images (we call this spurious gap), we assess spurious feature reliance for $89$ diverse ImageNet models, finding that even the best models underperform in images with weak spurious presence. However, the effect of spurious cues varies far more dramatically across classes, emphasizing the crucial, often overlooked, class-dependence of the spurious correlation problem. While most spurious features we observe are clarifying (i.e. improving test-time accuracy when present, as is typically expected), we surprisingly find many cases of confusing spurious features, where models perform better when they are absent. We then close the spurious gap by training new classification heads on lowly ranked (i.e. without common spurious cues) images, resulting in improved effective robustness to distribution shifts (ObjectNet, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-Sketch). We also propose a second metric to assess feature reliability, finding that spurious features are generally less reliable than non-spurious (core) ones, though again, spurious features can be more reliable for certain classes. To enable our analysis, we annotated $5,000$ feature-class dependencies over {\\it all} of ImageNet as core or spurious using minimal human supervision. Finally, we show the feature discovery and spuriosity ranking framework can be extended to other datasets like CelebA and WaterBirds in a lightweight fashion with only linear layer training, leading to discovering a previously unknown racial bias in the Celeb-A hair classification.

Prior work primarily focuses on metrics such as Failures In Time (FIT) rate and the Silent Data Corruption (SDC) rate, which quantify how often a device fails. Instead, this paper focuses on quantifying the DNN accuracy given that a transient error has occurred, which tells us how well a network behaves when a transient error occurs. We call this metric Resiliency Accuracy (RA). We show that existing RA formulation is fundamentally inaccurate, because it incorrectly assumes that software variables (model weights/activations) have equal faulty probability under hardware transient faults. We present an algorithm that captures the faulty probabilities of DNN variables under transient faults and, thus, provides correct RA estimations validated by hardware. To accelerate RA estimation, we reformulate RA calculation as a Monte Carlo integration problem, and solve it using importance sampling driven by DNN specific heuristics. Using our lightweight RA estimation method, we show that transient faults lead to far greater accuracy degradation than what todays DNN resiliency tools estimate. We show how our RA estimation tool can help design more resilient DNNs by integrating it with a Network Architecture Search framework. ",

This paper proposes a visual AOI (Area of Interest) based multimodal trajectory prediction model for probabilistic risk assessment at intersections. In this study, we find that the visual AOI implies the driving intention and is about 0.6-2.1 s ahead of the operation. Therefore, we designed a trajectory prediction model that integrates the driving intention (DI) and the multimodal trajectory (MT) predictions. The DI model was pre-trained independently to extract the driving intention using features including the visual AOI, historical vehicle states, and environmental context. The intention prediction experiments verify that the visual AOI-based DI model predicts steering intention 0.925 s ahead of the actual steering operation. The trained DI model is then integrated into the trajectory prediction model to filter multimodal trajectories. The trajectory prediction experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art models. Risk assessment for traffics at intersections verifies that the proposed method achieves high accuracy and a low false alarm rate, and identifies the potential risk about 3 s before a conflict occurs.

    "title": "On the Discredibility of Membership Inference Attacks",
    "abstract": "With the wide-spread application of machine learning models, it has become critical to study the potential data leakage of models trained on sensitive data. Recently, various membership inference (MI) attacks are proposed that determines if a sample was part of the training set or not. Although the first generation of MI attacks has been proven to be ineffective in practice, a few recent studies proposed practical MI attacks that achieve reasonable true positive rate at low false positive rate. The question is whether these attacks can be reliably used in practice. We showcase a practical application of membership inference attacks where it is used by an auditor (investigator) to prove to a judge/jury that an auditee unlawfully used sensitive data during training. Then, we show that the auditee can provide a dataset (with potentially unlimited number of samples) to a judge where MI attacks catastrophically fail. Hence, the auditee challenges the credibility of the auditor and can get the case dismissed. More importantly, we show that the auditee does not need to know anything about the MI attack neither a query access to it. In other words, all currently SOTA MI attacks in literature suffer from the same issue. Through comprehensive experimental evaluation, we show that our algorithms can increase the false positive rate from ten to thousands times larger than what auditor claim to the judge. Lastly, we argue that the implication of our algorithms is beyond discredibility: Current membership inference attacks can identify the memorized subpopulations, but they cannot reliably identify which exact sample in the subpopulation was used during training.

    "abstract": "Various types of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods have been developed, assuming that agents' policies are based on true states. Recent works have improved the robustness of MARL under uncertainties from the reward, transition probability, or other partners' policies. However, in real-world multi-agent systems, state estimations may be perturbed by sensor measurement noise or even adversaries. Agents' policies trained with only true state information will deviate from optimal solutions when facing adversarial state perturbations during execution. MARL under adversarial state perturbations has limited study. Hence, in this work, we propose a State-Adversarial Markov Game (SAMG) and make the first attempt to study the fundamental properties of MARL under state uncertainties. We prove that the optimal agent policy and the robust Nash equilibrium do not always exist for an SAMG. Instead, we define the solution concept, robust agent policy, of the proposed SAMG under adversarial state perturbations, where agents want to maximize the worst-case expected state value. We then design a gradient descent ascent-based robust MARL algorithm to learn the robust policies for the MARL agents. Our experiments show that adversarial state perturbations decrease agents' rewards for several baselines from the existing literature, while our algorithm outperforms baselines with state perturbations and significantly improves the robustness of the MARL policies under state uncertainties.

    "abstract": "Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) aims to boost detection performance by leveraging extra unlabeled data. The teacher-student framework has been shown to be promising for SSOD, in which a teacher network generates pseudo-labels for unlabeled data to assist the training of a student network. Since the pseudo-labels are noisy, filtering the pseudo-labels is crucial to exploit the potential of such framework. Unlike existing suboptimal methods, we propose a two-step pseudo-label filtering for the classification and regression heads in a teacher-student framework. For the classification head, OCL (Object-wise Contrastive Learning) regularizes the object representation learning that utilizes unlabeled data to improve pseudo-label filtering by enhancing the discriminativeness of the classification score. This is designed to pull together objects in the same class and push away objects from different classes. For the regression head, we further propose RUPL (Regression-Uncertainty-guided Pseudo-Labeling) to learn the aleatoric uncertainty of object localization for label filtering. By jointly filtering the pseudo-labels for the classification and regression heads, the student network receives better guidance from the teacher network for object detection task. Experimental results on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method with competitive performance compared to existing methods. ",

The index is constructed in a deterministic way such that, if significant common network topology exists between two networks, their indexes are likely to overlap. To align two networks, BLANT queries their respective indexes and creates a pool of aligned graphlet pairs. Then, BLANT merges graphlet pairs together in order to form large, high quality local alignments. Using BLANT, we discovered perfect subgraph isomorphisms of over 5,000 nodes with more than 95% of the aligned nodes being \"functionally\" identical among biological networks, as well as alignments of hundreds of nodes of similarly high accuracy on numerous temporal social networks. These alignments are anywhere from 10x-100x larger than alignments built by the state-of-the-art closest competitor. ",

    "abstract": "While deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance in solving many challenging tasks, they are limited to resource-constrained devices owing to their demand for computation power and storage space. Quantization is one of the most promising techniques to address this issue by quantizing the weights and/or activation tensors of a DNN into lower bit-width fixed-point numbers. While quantization has been empirically shown to introduce minor accuracy loss, it lacks formal guarantees on that, especially when the resulting quantized neural networks (QNNs) are deployed in safety-critical applications. A majority of existing verification methods focus exclusively on individual neural networks, either DNNs or QNNs. While promising attempts have been made to verify the quantization error bound between DNNs and their quantized counterparts, they are not complete and more importantly do not support fully quantified neural networks, namely, only weights are quantized. To fill this gap, in this work, we propose a quantization error bound verification method (QEBVerif), where both weights and activation tensors are quantized. QEBVerif consists of two analyses: a differential reachability analysis (DRA) and a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) based verification method. DRA performs difference analysis between the DNN and its quantized counterpart layer-by-layer to efficiently compute a tight quantization error interval. If it fails to prove the error bound, then we encode the verification problem into an equivalent MILP problem which can be solved by off-the-shelf solvers. Thus, QEBVerif is sound, complete, and arguably efficient. We implement QEBVerif in a tool and conduct extensive experiments, showing its effectiveness and efficiency. ",

    "abstract": "Recent aerial object detection models rely on a large amount of labeled training data, which requires unaffordable manual labeling costs in large aerial scenes with dense objects. Active learning is effective in reducing the data labeling cost by selectively querying the informative and representative unlabelled samples. However, existing active learning methods are mainly with class-balanced setting and image-based querying for generic object detection tasks, which are less applicable to aerial object detection scenario due to the long-tailed class distribution and dense small objects in aerial scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel active learning method for cost-effective aerial object detection. Specifically, both object-level and image-level informativeness are considered in the object selection to refrain from redundant and myopic querying. Besides, an easy-to-use class-balancing criterion is incorporated to favor the minority objects to alleviate the long-tailed class distribution problem in model training. To fully utilize the queried information, we further devise a training loss to mine the latent knowledge in the undiscovered image regions. Extensive experiments are conducted on the DOTA-v1.0 and DOTA-v2.0 benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that it can save more than 75% of the labeling cost to reach the same performance compared to the baselines and state-of-the-art active object detection methods.

This work proposes a strategy based on feature fusion and dilated convolution that employs dilated convolution to broaden the receptive field of feature maps at various scales in order to address this issue. On the one hand, it can improve the detection accuracy of larger objects. On the other hand, it provides more contextual information for small objects, which is beneficial to improving the detection accuracy of small objects. The shallow semantic information of small objects is obtained by filtering out the noise in the feature map, and the feature information of more small objects is preserved by using multi-scale fusion feature module and attention mechanism. The fusion of these shallow feature information and deep semantic information can generate richer feature maps for small object detection. Experiments show that this method can have higher accuracy than the traditional YOLOv3 network in the detection of small objects and occluded objects. In addition, we achieve 32.8\\% Mean Average Precision on the detection of small objects on MS COCO2017 test set. For 640*640 input, this method has 88.76\\% mAP on the PASCAL VOC2012 dataset. ",

Instead of treating all samples equally, we introduce the concept: ``friend networks\" to represent different relations among samples. To generate an accurate friend network with missing data, an end-to-end friend network reconstruction solution is designed to allow for continuous friend network optimization during imputation learning. The representation of the optimized friend network, in turn, is used to further optimize the data imputation process with differentiated message passing.

Although considerable progress has been made on robust steganography against JPEG re-compression, there exist few steganographic schemes capable of resisting to scaling attacks due to the tricky inverse interpolations involved in algorithm design. To tackle this issue, a framework for robust image steganography resisting to scaling with general interpolations either in standard form with fixed interpolation block, or pre-filtering based anti-aliasing implementation with variable block, is proposed in this paper. And the task of robust steganography can be formulated as one of constrained integer programming aiming at perfectly recover the secret message from stego image while minimizing the difference between cover and stego images. By introducing a metric - the degree of pixel involvement (dPI) to identify the modifiable pixels in cover image, the optimization problem above could be effectively solved using branch and bound algorithm (B\\&B). In addition, a customized distortion function for scaled stego images is adopted to further boost the security performance. Extensive experiments are carried out which demonstrate that the proposed scheme could not only outperform the prior art in terms of security by a clear margin, but also be applicable to resisting the scaling attacks with various interpolation techniques at arbitrary scaling factors (SFs).

In particular, we constructed a 15-year Twitter dataset on eight change timings of Japanese prime ministers consisting of 6.6M tweets and analyzed them in terms of sentiments, topics, and users. We found that, while not always, social media tend to show a honeymoon effect at the change timings of prime minister. The study also revealed that sentiment about prime ministers differed by topic, indicating that public expectations vary from one prime minister to another. Furthermore, the user base was largely replaced before and after the change in the prime minister, and their sentiment was also significantly different.

Though impressive detection results have been achieved by superior 3D detectors, they suffer from significant performance degeneration when facing unseen domains, such as different LiDAR configurations, different cities, and weather conditions. The mainstream approaches tend to solve these challenges by leveraging unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques. However, these UDA solutions just yield unsatisfactory 3D detection results when there is a severe domain shift, e.g., from Waymo (64-beam) to nuScenes (32-beam). To address this, we present a novel Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation method for 3D object detection (SSDA3D), where only a few labeled target data is available, yet can significantly improve the adaptation performance. In particular, our SSDA3D includes an Inter-domain Adaptation stage and an Intra-domain Generalization stage. In the first stage, an Inter-domain Point-CutMix module is presented to efficiently align the point cloud distribution across domains. The Point-CutMix generates mixed samples of an intermediate domain, thus encouraging to learn domain-invariant knowledge. Then, in the second stage, we further enhance the model for better generalization on the unlabeled target set. This is achieved by exploring Intra-domain Point-MixUp in semi-supervised learning, which essentially regularizes the pseudo label distribution. Experiments from Waymo to nuScenes show that, with only 10% labeled target data, our SSDA3D can surpass the fully-supervised oracle model with 100% target label.

Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) with spatially instantiated synaptic weights holds high promise to overcome this challenge, by performing matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) directly within the network weights stored on a chip to execute an inference workload. However, to achieve end-to-end improvements in latency and energy consumption, AIMC must be combined with on-chip digital operations and communication to move towards configurations in which a full inference workload is realized entirely on-chip. Moreover, it is highly desirable to achieve high MVM and inference accuracy without application-wise re-tuning of the chip.

Our generator is highly parameterizable: the number of variables of the instances it produces, as well as their number of clauses and the number of literals in each clause, can all be set to any value. Our instances have been tested on state of the art model counters, against other difficult model counting instances, in the Model Counting Competition. The smallest unsolved instances of the competition, both in terms of number of variables and number of clauses, were ours. We also observe a peak of difficulty when fixing the number of variables and varying the number of clauses, in both random instances and instances built by our generator. Using these results, we predict the parameter values for which the hardest to count instances will occur. ",

    "title": "Loss Adapted Plasticity in Deep Neural Networks to Learn from Data with  Unreliable Sources",
    "abstract": "When data is streaming from multiple sources, conventional training methods update model weights often assuming the same level of reliability for each source; that is: a model does not consider data quality of each source during training. In many applications, sources can have varied levels of noise or corruption that has negative effects on the learning of a robust deep learning model. A key issue is that the quality of data or labels for individual sources is often not available during training and could vary over time. Our solution to this problem is to consider the mistakes made while training on data originating from sources and utilise this to create a perceived data quality for each source. This paper demonstrates a straight-forward and novel technique that can be applied to any gradient descent optimiser: Update model weights as a function of the perceived reliability of data sources within a wider data set. The algorithm controls the plasticity of a given model to weight updates based on the history of losses from individual data sources. We show that applying this technique can significantly improve model performance when trained on a mixture of reliable and unreliable data sources, and maintain performance when models are trained on data sources that are all considered reliable. All code to reproduce this work's experiments and implement the algorithm in the reader's own models is made available. ",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a graph-based approach to representing spatio-temporal trajectory data that allows an effective visualization and characterization of city-wide traffic dynamics. With the advance of sensor, mobile, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, vehicle and passenger trajectories are being increasingly collected on a massive scale and are becoming a critical source of insight into traffic pattern and traveller behaviour. To leverage such trajectory data to better understand traffic dynamics in a large-scale urban network, this study develops a trajectory-based network traffic analysis method that converts individual trajectory data into a sequence of graphs that evolve over time (known as dynamic graphs or time-evolving graphs) and analyses network-wide traffic patterns in terms of a compact and informative graph-representation of aggregated traffic flows. First, we partition the entire network into a set of cells based on the spatial distribution of data points in individual trajectories, where the cells represent spatial regions between which aggregated traffic flows can be measured. Next, dynamic flows of moving objects are represented as a time-evolving graph, where regions are graph vertices and flows between them are treated as weighted directed edges. Given a fixed set of vertices, edges can be inserted or removed at every time step depending on the presence of traffic flows between two regions at a given time window. Once a dynamic graph is built, we apply graph mining algorithms to detect change-points in time, which represent time points where the graph exhibits significant changes in its overall structure and, thus, correspond to change-points in city-wide mobility pattern throughout the day (e.g., global transition points between peak and off-peak periods).

The new algorithm learns to approximate the (unidentifiability) region of model parameters from such mixed data sources. On this basis, it delivers interval approximations to counterfactual results, which collapse to points in the identifiable case. The algorithm is very general, it works on semi-Markovian models with discrete variables and can compute any counterfactual. Moreover, it automatically determines if a problem is feasible (the parameter region being nonempty), which is a necessary step not to yield incorrect results. Systematic numerical experiments show the effectiveness and accuracy of the algorithm, while hinting at the benefits of integrating heterogeneous data to get informative bounds in case of unidentifiability.

Deep learning-based weather forecasting has made stunning progress, from various backbone studies using CNN, RNN, and Transformer to training strategies using weather observations datasets with auxiliary inputs. All of this progress has contributed to the field of weather forecasting; however, many elements and complex structures of deep learning models prevent us from reaching physical interpretations. This paper proposes a SImple baseline with a spatiotemporal context Aggregation Network (SIANet) that achieved state-of-the-art in 4 parts of 5 benchmarks of W4C22. This simple but efficient structure uses only satellite images and CNNs in an end-to-end fashion without using a multi-model ensemble or fine-tuning. This simplicity of SIANet can be used as a solid baseline that can be easily applied in weather forecasting using deep learning. ",

In this paper, we propose a training strategy to make the weather prediction model robust to spatial-temporal shifts. We first analyze the effect of hyperparameters and augmentations of the existing training strategy on the spatial-temporal shift robustness of the model.

In the first stage, we pre-train a model on the current annotated data to detect objects from the current known classes, and concurrently train an additional binary classifier to classify predictions into foreground or background classes. This helps the model to build an unbiased feature representations that can facilitate the detection of unknown classes in subsequent process. In the second stage, we fine-tune the class-specific components of the model with a multi-view self-labeling strategy and a consistency constraint.

The spatial context effect of the input satellite image has been deeply explored and optimal context range has been found.

To further improve the model performance, multi-model ensemble and threshold optimization were used to produce the final probabilistic rain prediction. Experiment results and leaderboard scores demonstrate that optimal spatial context, combined loss function, multi-model ensemble, and threshold optimization all provide modest model gain. A permutation test was used to analyze the effect of each satellite band on rain prediction, and results show that satellite bands signifying cloudtop phase (8.7 um) and cloud-top height (10.8 and 13.4 um) are the best predictors for rain prediction.

Methods: We identified SDoH categories and attributes and developed an SDoH corpus using clinical notes from a general cancer cohort. We compared four transformer-based NLP models to extract SDoH, examined the generalizability of NLP models to a cohort of patients prescribed with opioids, and explored customization strategies to improve performance. We applied the best NLP model to extract 19 categories of SDoH from the breast (n=7,971), lung (n=11,804), and colorectal cancer (n=6,240) cohorts. Results and Conclusion: We developed a corpus of 629 cancer patients notes with annotations of 13,193 SDoH concepts/attributes from 19 categories of SDoH. The Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model achieved the best strict/lenient F1 scores of 0.9216 and 0.9441 for SDoH concept extraction, 0.9617 and 0.9626 for linking attributes to SDoH concepts. Fine-tuning the NLP models using new annotations from opioid use patients improved the strict/lenient F1 scores from 0.8172/0.8502 to 0.8312/0.8679. The extraction rates among 19 categories of SDoH varied greatly, where 10 SDoH could be extracted from >70% of cancer patients, but 9 SDoH had a low extraction rate (<70% of cancer patients).

We hypothesise that the spatial distribution of tissue conductivity can be directly inferred from an array of concurrently acquired contact electrograms (EGMs). We generate a dataset of simulated cardiac AP propagation using randomised scar distributions and a phenomenological cardiac model and calculate contact electrograms at various positions on the field. A deep neural network, based on a modified U-net architecture, is trained to estimate the location of the scar and quantify conductivity of the tissue with a Jaccard index of $91$%. We adapt a wavelet-based surrogate testing analysis to confirm that the inferred conductivity distribution is an accurate representation of the ground truth input to the model.

    "abstract": "Adversarial machine learning has been both a major concern and a hot topic recently, especially with the ubiquitous use of deep neural networks in the current landscape. Adversarial attacks and defenses are usually likened to a cat-and-mouse game in which defenders and attackers evolve over the time. On one hand, the goal is to develop strong and robust deep networks that are resistant to malicious actors. On the other hand, in order to achieve that, we need to devise even stronger adversarial attacks to challenge these defense models. Most of existing attacks employs a single $\\ell_p$ distance (commonly, $p\\in\\{1,2,\\infty\\}$) to define the concept of closeness and performs steepest gradient ascent w.r.t. this $p$-norm to update all pixels in an adversarial example in the same way. These $\\ell_p$ attacks each has its own pros and cons; and there is no single attack that can successfully break through defense models that are robust against multiple $\\ell_p$ norms simultaneously. Motivated by these observations, we come up with a natural approach: combining various $\\ell_p$ gradient projections on a pixel level to achieve a joint adversarial perturbation. Specifically, we learn how to perturb each pixel to maximize the attack performance, while maintaining the overall visual imperceptibility of adversarial examples. Finally, through various experiments with standardized benchmarks, we show that our method outperforms most current strong attacks across state-of-the-art defense mechanisms, while retaining its ability to remain clean visually.

We analyze how this method can be applied to Sentinel-1 and -2 satellite imagery and develop several extensions toward making it effective in practice.

Further, we provide evidence that instance normalization can significantly stabilize the training process and that explicitly shaping the embedding space using supervised contrastive learning can lead to improved performance.

    "abstract": "In this paper, an adaptive cooperative guidance strategy for the active protection of a target spacecraft trying to evade an interceptor was developed. The target spacecraft performs evasive maneuvers, launching an active defense vehicle to divert the interceptor. Instead of classical strategies, which are based on optimal control or differential game theory, the problem was solved by using the deep reinforcement learning method, and imperfect information was assumed for the interceptor maneuverability. To address the sparse reward problem, a universal reward design method and an increasingly difficult training approach were presented utilizing the shaping technique. Guidance law, reward function, and training approach were demonstrated through the learning process and Monte Carlo simulations. The application of the non-sparse reward function and increasingly difficult training approach accelerated the model convergence, alleviating the overfitting problem. Considering a standard optimal guidance law as a benchmark, the effectiveness, and the advantages, that guarantee the target spacecraft's escape and win rates in a multi-agent game, of the proposed guidance strategy were validated by the simulation results. The trained agent's adaptiveness to the interceptor maneuverability was superior to the optimal guidance law. Moreover, compared to the standard optimal guidance law, the proposed guidance strategy performed better with less prior knowledge. ",

    "abstract": "Interpreting neural network classifiers using gradient-based saliency maps has been extensively studied in the deep learning literature. While the existing algorithms manage to achieve satisfactory performance in application to standard image recognition datasets, recent works demonstrate the vulnerability of widely-used gradient-based interpretation schemes to norm-bounded perturbations adversarially designed for every individual input sample. However, such adversarial perturbations are commonly designed using the knowledge of an input sample, and hence perform sub-optimally in application to an unknown or constantly changing data point. In this paper, we show the existence of a Universal Perturbation for Interpretation (UPI) for standard image datasets, which can alter a gradient-based feature map of neural networks over a significant fraction of test samples. To design such a UPI, we propose a gradient-based optimization method as well as a principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach to compute a UPI which can effectively alter a neural network's gradient-based interpretation on different samples. We support the proposed UPI approaches by presenting several numerical results of their successful applications to standard image datasets. ",

Nevertheless, it is not trivial to exploit such latent variable models to capture the dependency among discrete words and meanwhile pursue complex visual-language alignment in image captioning. In this paper, we break the deeply rooted conventions in learning Transformer-based encoder-decoder, and propose a new diffusion model based paradigm tailored for image captioning, namely Semantic-Conditional Diffusion Networks (SCD-Net). Technically, for each input image, we first search the semantically relevant sentences via cross-modal retrieval model to convey the comprehensive semantic information. The rich semantics are further regarded as semantic prior to trigger the learning of Diffusion Transformer, which produces the output sentence in a diffusion process. In SCD-Net, multiple Diffusion Transformer structures are stacked to progressively strengthen the output sentence with better visional-language alignment and linguistical coherence in a cascaded manner. Furthermore, to stabilize the diffusion process, a new self-critical sequence training strategy is designed to guide the learning of SCD-Net with the knowledge of a standard autoregressive Transformer model. Extensive experiments on COCO dataset demonstrate the promising potential of using diffusion models in the challenging image captioning task.

In contrast, many practical applications, such as video alignment, strongly demand learning the intensive representation of long videos. In this paper, we introduce a new framework of contrastive action representation learning (CARL) to learn frame-wise action representation in a self-supervised or weakly-supervised manner, especially for long videos. Specifically, we introduce a simple but effective video encoder that considers both spatial and temporal context by combining convolution and transformer. Inspired by the recent massive progress in self-supervised learning, we propose a new sequence contrast loss (SCL) applied to two related views obtained by expanding a series of spatio-temporal data in two versions. One is the self-supervised version that optimizes embedding space by minimizing KL-divergence between sequence similarity of two augmented views and prior Gaussian distribution of timestamp distance. The other is the weakly-supervised version that builds more sample pairs among videos using video-level labels by dynamic time wrapping (DTW). Experiments on FineGym, PennAction, and Pouring datasets show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art by a large margin for downstream fine-grained action classification and even faster inference. Surprisingly, although without training on paired videos like in previous works, our self-supervised version also shows outstanding performance in video alignment and fine-grained frame retrieval tasks.

    "abstract": "Modern Just-in-Time compilers (or JITs) typically interleave several mechanisms to execute a program. For faster startup times and to observe the initial behavior of an execution, interpretation can be initially used. But after a while, JITs dynamically produce native code for parts of the program they execute often. Although some time is spent compiling dynamically, this mechanism makes for much faster times for the remaining of the program execution. Such compilers are complex pieces of software with various components, and greatly rely on a precise interplay between the different languages being executed, including on-stack-replacement. Traditional static compilers like CompCert have been mechanized in proof assistants, but JITs have been scarcely formalized so far, partly due to their impure nature and their numerous components. This work presents a model JIT with dynamic generation of native code, implemented and formally verified in Coq. Although some parts of a JIT cannot be written in Coq, we propose a proof methodology to delimit, specify and reason on the impure effects of a JIT. We argue that the daunting task of formally verifying a complete JIT should draw on existing proofs of native code generation. To this end, our work successfully reuses CompCert and its correctness proofs during dynamic compilation. Finally, our prototype can be extracted and executed. ",

In this paper, we aim at generalizing the work from [1], in which an a posteriori estimator of the geometrical defeaturing error is derived for domains from which one geometrical feature is removed. More precisely, we study the case of domains containing an arbitrary number of distinct features, and we perform an analysis on Poisson's, linear elasticity, and Stokes' equations. We introduce a simple and computationally cheap a posteriori estimator of the geometrical defeaturing error, whose reliability and efficiency are rigorously proved, and we introduce a geometric refinement strategy that accounts for the defeaturing error: Starting from a fully defeatured geometry, the algorithm determines at each iteration step which features need to be added to the geometrical model to reduce the defeaturing error. These important features are then added to the (partially) defeatured geometrical model at the next iteration, until the solution attains a prescribed accuracy.

The pressures affecting the survival and pollination capabilities of honey bees (Apis mellifera), wild bees and other pollinators is well-documented, but incomplete. In order to estimate the potential effectiveness of various candidate policies to support pollination services, there is an urgent need to quantify the effect of various combinations of variables on the pollination ecosystem service, utilising available information, models and expert judgement.

Unfortunately, while rigorous safety frameworks from robust optimal control theory scale poorly to high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, control policies computed by more tractable \"deep\" methods lack guarantees and tend to exhibit little robustness to uncertain operating conditions. This work introduces a novel approach enabling scalable synthesis of robust safety-preserving controllers for robotic systems with general nonlinear dynamics subject to bounded modeling error by combining game-theoretic safety analysis with adversarial reinforcement learning in simulation. Following a soft actor-critic scheme, a safety-seeking fallback policy is co-trained with an adversarial \"disturbance\" agent that aims to invoke the worst-case realization of model error and training-to-deployment discrepancy allowed by the designer's uncertainty. While the learned control policy does not intrinsically guarantee safety, it is used to construct a real-time safety filter (or shield) with robust safety guarantees based on forward reachability rollouts. This shield can be used in conjunction with a safety-agnostic control policy, precluding any task-driven actions that could result in loss of safety. We evaluate our learning-based safety approach in a 5D race car simulator, compare the learned safety policy to the numerically obtained optimal solution, and empirically validate the robust safety guarantee of our proposed safety shield against worst-case model discrepancy.

To address this, we propose a self-supervised approach for correspondence estimation that learns from multiview consistency in short RGB-D video sequences.

Our key insight is that self-supervised multiview registration allows us to obtain correspondences over longer time frames; increasing both the diversity and difficulty of sampled pairs.

Specifically, we propose a point-wise confidence selection to obtain reliable labels from the historical predictions of each point. A cluster-wise label correction is proposed with a voting strategy to generate the best possible label by considering the neighbor correlations. To handle boundary-level label noise, we also propose a variant ``PNAL-boundary \" with a progressive boundary label cleaning strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets. Even with $60\\%$ symmetric noise and high-level boundary noise, our framework significantly outperforms its baselines, and is comparable to the upper bound trained on completely clean data.

However, quantum learning systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: adding tiny carefully-crafted perturbations on legitimate input samples can cause misclassifications. To address this issue, we propose a general scheme to protect quantum learning systems from adversarial attacks by randomly encoding the legitimate data samples through unitary or quantum error correction encoders. In particular, we rigorously prove that both global and local random unitary encoders lead to exponentially vanishing gradients (i.e. barren plateaus) for any variational quantum circuits that aim to add adversarial perturbations, independent of the input data and the inner structures of adversarial circuits and quantum classifiers. In addition, we prove a rigorous bound on the vulnerability of quantum classifiers under local unitary adversarial attacks. We show that random black-box quantum error correction encoders can protect quantum classifiers against local adversarial noises and their robustness increases as we concatenate error correction codes. To quantify the robustness enhancement, we adapt quantum differential privacy as a measure of the prediction stability for quantum classifiers. Our results establish versatile defense strategies for quantum classifiers against adversarial perturbations, which provide valuable guidance to enhance the reliability and security for both near-term and future quantum learning technologies.

In this paper, we systematically study quantum algorithms for finding an $\\epsilon$-approximate second-order stationary point ($\\epsilon$-SOSP) of a $d$-dimensional nonconvex function, a fundamental problem in nonconvex optimization, with noisy zeroth- or first-order oracles as inputs. We first prove that, up to noise of $O(\\epsilon^{10}/d^5)$, accelerated perturbed gradient descent with quantum gradient estimation takes $O(\\log d/\\epsilon^{1.75})$ quantum queries to find an $\\epsilon$-SOSP.

    "abstract": "More and more stock trading strategies are constructed using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, but DRL methods originally widely used in the gaming community are not directly adaptable to financial data with low signal-to-noise ratios and unevenness, and thus suffer from performance shortcomings. In this paper, to capture the hidden information, we propose a DRL based stock trading system using cascaded LSTM, which first uses LSTM to extract the time-series features from stock daily data, and then the features extracted are fed to the agent for training, while the strategy functions in reinforcement learning also use another LSTM for training. Experiments in DJI in the US market and SSE50 in the Chinese stock market show that our model outperforms previous baseline models in terms of cumulative returns and Sharp ratio, and this advantage is more significant in the Chinese stock market, a merging market. It indicates that our proposed method is a promising way to build a automated stock trading system. ",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel method, named AV2vec, for learning audio-visual speech representations by multimodal self-distillation. AV2vec has a student and a teacher module, in which the student performs a masked latent feature regression task using the multimodal target features generated online by the teacher. The parameters of the teacher model are a momentum update of the student. Since our target features are generated online, AV2vec needs no iteration step like AV-HuBERT and the total training time cost is reduced to less than one-fifth. We further propose AV2vec-MLM in this study, which augments AV2vec with a masked language model (MLM)-style loss using multitask learning. Our experimental results show that AV2vec achieved comparable performance to the AV-HuBERT baseline. When combined with an MLM-style loss, AV2vec-MLM outperformed baselines and achieved the best performance on the downstream tasks. ",

However, their content is unstructured and diverse, resulting in a significant gap in providing sufficient information for material design and synthesis. To this end, we used natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to discover valuable experimental-based information about nanomaterials and synthesis methods in energy-material-related publications. Our first system, TextMaster, extracts opinions from texts and classifies them into challenges and opportunities, achieving 94% and 92% accuracy, respectively. Our second system, GraphMaster, realizes data extraction of tables and figures from publications with 98.3\\% classification accuracy and 4.3% data extraction mean square error. Our results show that these systems could assess the suitability of materials for a certain application by evaluation of synthesis insights and case analysis with detailed references. This work offers a fresh perspective on mining knowledge from scientific literature, providing a wide swatch to accelerate nanomaterial research through CNN. ",

    "abstract": "Quantitative cancer image analysis relies on the accurate delineation of tumours, a very specialised and time-consuming task. For this reason, methods for automated segmentation of tumours in medical imaging have been extensively developed in recent years, being Computed Tomography one of the most popular imaging modalities explored. However, the large amount of 3D voxels in a typical scan is prohibitive for the entire volume to be analysed at once in conventional hardware. To overcome this issue, the processes of downsampling and/or resampling are generally implemented when using traditional convolutional neural networks in medical imaging. In this paper, we propose a new methodology that introduces a process of sparsification of the input images and submanifold sparse convolutional networks as an alternative to downsampling. As a proof of concept, we applied this new methodology to Computed Tomography images of renal cancer patients, obtaining performances of segmentations of kidneys and tumours competitive with previous methods (~84.6% Dice similarity coefficient), while achieving a significant improvement in computation time (2-3 min per training epoch).

For the finance sector, it offers many opportunities for significant market innovation and yet broad adoption of AI systems heavily relies on our trust in their outputs. Trust in technology is enabled by understanding the rationale behind the predictions made. To this end, the concept of eXplainable AI emerged introducing a suite of techniques attempting to explain to users how complex models arrived at a certain decision. For cross-sectional data classical XAI approaches can lead to valuable insights about the models' inner workings, but these techniques generally cannot cope well with longitudinal data (time series) in the presence of dependence structure and non-stationarity. We here propose a novel XAI technique for deep learning methods which preserves and exploits the natural time ordering of the data. ",

Recent state-of-the-art VAD systems are often based on neural networks, but they require a computational budget that usually exceeds the capabilities of a small battery-operated device when preserving the performance of larger models. In this work, we rely on the input from a bone conduction microphone (BCM) to design an efficient VAD (BC-VAD) robust against residual non-stationary noises originating from the environment or speakers not wearing the BCM.We first show that a larger VAD system (58k parameters) achieves state-of-the-art results on a publicly available benchmark but fails when running on bone conduction signals. We then compare its variant BC-VAD (5k parameters and trained on BC data) with a baseline especially designed for a BCM and show that the proposed method achieves better performances under various metrics while keeping the realtime processing requirement for a microcontroller.

    "title": "Towards a Better Understanding of the Characteristics of Fractal  Networks",
    "abstract": "The fractal nature of complex networks has received a great deal of research interest in the last two decades. Similarly to geometric fractals, the fractality of networks can also be defined with the so-called box-covering method. A network is called fractal if the minimum number of boxes needed to cover the entire network follows a power-law relation with the size of the boxes. The fractality of networks has been associated with various network properties throughout the years, for example, disassortativity, repulsion between hubs, long-range-repulsive correlation, and small edge betweenness centralities. However, these assertions are usually based on tailor-made network models and on a small number of real networks, hence their ubiquity is often disputed. Since fractal networks have been shown to have important properties, such as robustness against intentional attacks, it is in dire need to uncover the underlying mechanisms causing fractality. Hence, the main goal of this work is to get a better understanding of the origins of fractality in complex networks. To this end, we systematically review the previous results on the relationship between various network characteristics and fractality. Moreover, we perform a comprehensive analysis of these relations on five network models and a large number of real-world networks originating from six domains. We clarify which characteristics are universally present in fractal networks and which features are just artifacts or coincidences. ",

    "abstract": "This letter presents a framework for synthesizing a robust full-state feedback controller for systems with unknown nonlinearities. Our approach characterizes input-output behavior of the nonlinearities in terms of local norm bounds using available sampled data corresponding to a known region about an equilibrium point. A challenge in this approach is that if the nonlinearities have explicit dependence on the control inputs, an a priori selection of the control input sampling region is required to determine the local norm bounds. This leads to a \"chicken and egg\" problem, where the local norm bounds are required for controller synthesis, but the region of control inputs needed to be characterized cannot be known prior to synthesis of the controller. To tackle this issue, we constrain the closed-loop control inputs within the sampling region while synthesizing the controller. As the resulting synthesis problem is non-convex, three semi-definite programs (SDPs) are obtained through convex relaxations of the main problem, and an iterative algorithm is constructed using these SDPs for control synthesis. Two numerical examples are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. ",
