While accessibility to transit is important in general, some sections of the population depend critically on transit. However, existing public transit is often not designed equitably, and often, equity is only considered as an additional objective post hoc, which hampers systemic changes. We present a formulation for transit network design that considers different notions of equity and welfare explicitly. We study the interaction between network design and various concepts of equity and present trade-offs and results based on real-world data from a large metropolitan area in the United States of America.

    "abstract": "In recent years, automotive technology has made a steady progress. In particular, Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) has enabled many safety features in commercial vehicles, for instance, pedestrian detection, lane keeping assist, emergency automatic braking, etc. Although these features provide drivers with a safer operational environment, crashes still happen occasionally due to the complex road conditions and the unpredictable movement of road users including vehicles, pedestrians, bicyclists, and non-motorized vehicles. In this paper, we aim at predicting the possibilities of crashes between vehicles on highway and implementing an appropriate active safety system to prevent the same. In particular, hidden Markov models are developed for the traffic lanes and speed change of vehicles on highway. Algorithms are developed for the prediction of crash probabilities. Simulation experiments are conducted using Matlab, the results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed research. ",

In this method we use the restriction of standard space-time finite element spaces on a fixed bulk mesh to the space-time surface. The structure of the method is such that it naturally fits to a level set representation of the evolving surface. The higher order version of the method is based on a space-time variant of a mesh deformation that has been developed in the literature for stationary surfaces. The discretization method that we present is of (optimal) higher order accuracy for smoothly varying surfaces with sufficiently smooth solutions. Without any modifications the method can be used for the discretization of problems with topological singularities. A numerical study demonstrates both the higher order accuracy for smooth cases and the robustness with respect to toplogical singularities. ",

    "abstract": "Learning fair graph representations for downstream applications is becoming increasingly important, but existing work has mostly focused on improving fairness at the global level by either modifying the graph structure or objective function without taking into account the local neighborhood of a node. In this work, we formally introduce the notion of neighborhood fairness and develop a computational framework for learning such locally fair embeddings. We argue that the notion of neighborhood fairness is more appropriate since GNN-based models operate at the local neighborhood level of a node. Our neighborhood fairness framework has two main components that are flexible for learning fair graph representations from arbitrary data: the first aims to construct fair neighborhoods for any arbitrary node in a graph and the second enables adaption of these fair neighborhoods to better capture certain application or data-dependent constraints, such as allowing neighborhoods to be more biased towards certain attributes or neighbors in the graph.Furthermore, while link prediction has been extensively studied, we are the first to investigate the graph representation learning task of fair link classification. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed neighborhood fairness framework for a variety of graph machine learning tasks including fair link prediction, link classification, and learning fair graph embeddings. Notably, our approach achieves not only better fairness but also increases the accuracy in the majority of cases across a wide variety of graphs, problem settings, and metrics. ",

However, as networks increase in scale and complexity, some models present limitations, such as the assumption of markovian traffic in queuing theory models, or the high computational cost of network simulators. Recent advances in machine learning, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNN), are enabling a new generation of network models that are data-driven and can learn complex non-linear behaviors. In this paper, we present RouteNet-Fermi, a custom GNN model that shares the same goals as queuing theory, while being considerably more accurate in the presence of realistic traffic models. The proposed model predicts accurately the delay, jitter, and loss in networks. We have tested RouteNet-Fermi in networks of increasing size (up to 300 nodes), including samples with mixed traffic profiles -- e.g., with complex non-markovian models -- and arbitrary routing and queue scheduling configurations. Our experimental results show that RouteNet-Fermi achieves similar accuracy as computationally-expensive packet-level simulators and it is able to accurately scale to large networks. For example, the model produces delay estimates with a mean relative error of 6.24% when applied to a test dataset with 1,000 samples, including network topologies one order of magnitude larger than those seen during training.

The popularization of cloud services has sped up their adoption due to the ease of deploying large-scale machine-learning models. It has also drawn the attention of the industrial sector because of its ability to identify common problems in production. However, there are challenges to conform an ensemble classifier, namely a proper selection and effective training of the pool of classifiers, the definition of a proper architecture for multi-class classification, and uncertainty quantification of the ensemble classifier. The robustness and effectiveness of the ensemble classifier lie in the selection of the pool of classifiers, as well as in the learning process. Hence, the selection and the training procedure of the pool of classifiers play a crucial role. An (ensemble) classifier learns to detect the classes that were used during the supervised training. However, when injecting data with unknown conditions, the trained classifier will intend to predict the classes learned during the training. To this end, the uncertainty of the individual and ensemble classifier could be used to assess the learning capability. We present a novel approach for novel detection using ensemble classification and evidence theory. A pool selection strategy is presented to build a solid ensemble classifier. We present an architecture for multi-class ensemble classification and an approach to quantify the uncertainty of the individual classifiers and the ensemble classifier. We use uncertainty for the anomaly detection approach. Finally, we use the benchmark Tennessee Eastman to perform experiments to test the ensemble classifier's prediction and anomaly detection capabilities. ",

Attackers launch front-running attacks by inserting additional transactions before upcoming victim transactions to manipulate victim transaction executions and make profits. Recent studies have shown that front-running attacks are prevalent on the Ethereum blockchain and have caused millions of US dollars loss. Vulnerable smart contracts, blockchain programs invoked by transactions, are held responsible for front-running attacks. Although techniques to detect front-running vulnerabilities have been proposed, their performance on real-world vulnerable contracts is unclear. There is no large-scale benchmark based on real attacks to evaluate their capabilities. This motivates us to build a benchmark consisting of 513 real-world attacks with vulnerable code labeled in 235 distinct smart contracts. We propose automated techniques to effectively collect real-world attacks and localize the corresponding vulnerable code at scale. Our experiments show that our approaches are effective, achieving higher recall in finding real attacks and higher precision in pinpointing vulnerabilities compared to the existing techniques. The evaluation of seven state-of-the-art vulnerability detection techniques on the benchmark reveals their inadequacy in detecting front-running vulnerabilities, with a low recall of at most 6.04%. Our further analysis identifies four common limitations in existing techniques: lack of support for inter-contract analysis, inefficient constraint solving for cryptographic operations, improper vulnerability patterns, and lack of token support.

Here we construct such codes of rate asymptotically approaching one, thereby offering a complete solution to this problem. Equivalently, this question can be phrased as a version of hat-guessing games on graphs (e.g., P.J. Cameron e.a., Electronic J. Comb., 2016). In this language, we construct triangle-free graphs with success probability of the players approaching one as the number of vertices tends to infinity.

Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has been proposed to separate network traffics into two disjoint subspaces corresponding to normal and malicious behaviors for anomaly detection. However, the privacy concerns and limitations of devices' computing resources compromise the practical effectiveness of PCA. We propose a federated PCA-based Grassmannian optimization framework that coordinates IoT devices to aggregate a joint profile of normal network behaviors for anomaly detection. First, we introduce a privacy-preserving federated PCA framework to simultaneously capture the profile of various IoT devices' traffic. Then, we investigate the alternating direction method of multipliers gradient-based learning on the Grassmann manifold to guarantee fast training and the absence of detecting latency using limited computational resources. Empirical results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches. Finally, we show that the Grassmann manifold algorithm is highly adapted for IoT anomaly detection, which permits drastically reducing the analysis time of the system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first federated PCA algorithm for anomaly detection meeting the requirements of IoT networks. ",

The prior works mainly focus on knowledge transferring to the object proposal classification and employ class-agnostic box and mask prediction. In this work, we propose CondHead, a principled dynamic network design to better generalize the box regression and mask segmentation for open vocabulary setting. The core idea is to conditionally parameterize the network heads on semantic embedding and thus the model is guided with class-specific knowledge to better detect novel categories. Specifically, CondHead is composed of two streams of network heads, the dynamically aggregated head and the dynamically generated head. The former is instantiated with a set of static heads that are conditionally aggregated, these heads are optimized as experts and are expected to learn sophisticated prediction. The latter is instantiated with dynamically generated parameters and encodes general class-specific information. With such a conditional design, the detection model is bridged by the semantic embedding to offer strongly generalizable class-wise box and mask prediction. Our method brings significant improvement to the state-of-the-art open vocabulary object detection methods with very minor overhead, e.g., it surpasses a RegionClip model by 3.0 detection AP on novel categories, with only 1.1% more computation.

Although NAS surpasses human-designed architecture in many fields, the high computational cost of architecture evaluation it requires hinders its development. A feasible solution is to directly evaluate some metrics in the initial stage of the architecture without any training. NAS without training (WOT) score is such a metric, which estimates the final trained accuracy of the architecture through the ability to distinguish different inputs in the activation layer. However, WOT score is not an atomic metric, meaning that it does not represent a fundamental indicator of the architecture. The contributions of this paper are in three folds. First, we decouple WOT into two atomic metrics which represent the distinguishing ability of the network and the number of activation units, and explore better combination rules named (Distinguishing Activation Score) DAS. We prove the correctness of decoupling theoretically and confirmed the effectiveness of the rules experimentally. Second, in order to improve the prediction accuracy of DAS to meet practical search requirements, we propose a fast training strategy. When DAS is used in combination with the fast training strategy, it yields more improvements. Third, we propose a dataset called Darts-training-bench (DTB), which fills the gap that no training states of architecture in existing datasets.

One scenario is to recommend items to clients with limited historical data and sharing similar preferences with other clients in a social network. On the other hand, due to the increasing demands for the protection of clients' data privacy, Federated Learning (FL) has been widely adopted: FL requires models to be trained in a multi-client system and restricts sharing of raw data among clients. The underlying potential data-sharing conflict between LoG and FL is under-explored and how to benefit from both sides is a promising problem. In this work, we first formulate the Graph Federated Learning (GFL) problem that unifies LoG and FL in multi-client systems and then propose sharing hidden representation instead of the raw data of neighbors to protect data privacy as a solution. To overcome the biased gradient problem in GFL, we provide a gradient estimation method and its convergence analysis under the non-convex objective. In experiments, we evaluate our method in classification tasks on graphs. Our experiment shows a good match between our theory and the practice. ",

Traditional methods perform appraisal based on the domain knowledge, but suffer from the efforts of hand-crafted design. Recently, several methods have been developed to automatize the valuation process by taking the property trading transaction into account when estimating the property value. However, existing methods only consider the real estate itself, ignoring the relation between the properties. Moreover, naively aggregating the information of neighbors fails to model the relationships between the transactions. To tackle these limitations, we propose a novel Neighbor Relation Graph Learning Framework (ReGram) by incorporating the relation between target transaction and surrounding neighbors with the attention mechanism. To model the influence between communities, we integrate the environmental information and the past price of each transaction from other communities. Moreover, since the target transactions in different regions share some similarities and differences of characteristics, we introduce a dynamic adapter to model the different distributions of the target transactions based on the input-related kernel weights. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset with various scenarios demonstrate that ReGram robustly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies were conducted to examine the effectiveness of each component in ReGram. ",

To remove this design flaw, several Move Method refactoring tools have been proposed. To the best of our knowledge, state-of-the-art related techniques can be broadly divided into two categories: the first line is non-machine-learning-based approaches built on software measurement, while the selection and thresholds of software metrics heavily rely on expert knowledge. The second line is machine learning-based approaches, which suggest Move Method refactoring by learning to extract features from code information. However, most approaches in this line treat different forms of code information identically, disregarding their significant variation on data analysis. In this paper, we propose an approach to recommend Move Method refactoring named RMove by automatically learning structural and semantic representation from code fragment respectively. We concatenate these representations together and further train the machine learning classifiers to guide the movement of method to suitable classes. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available datasets. The results show that our approach outperforms three state-of-the-art refactoring tools including PathMove, JDeodorant, and JMove in effectiveness and usefulness.

We further propose a post-hoc module EndoBoost, which can be plugged into generic polyp detection models to filter out false positive predictions. This is realized by generative learning of the polyp manifold with normalizing flows and rejecting false positives through density estimation. Compared to supervised classification, this anomaly detection paradigm achieves better data efficiency and robustness in open-world settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate a promising false positive suppression in both retrospective and prospective validation. In addition, the released dataset can be used to perform 'stress' tests on established detection systems and encourages further research toward robust and reliable computer-aided endoscopic image analysis.

    "abstract": "With the ever-growing model size and the limited availability of labeled training data, transfer learning has become an increasingly popular approach in many science and engineering domains. For classification problems, this work delves into the mystery of transfer learning through an intriguing phenomenon termed neural collapse (NC), where the last-layer features and classifiers of learned deep networks satisfy: (i) the within-class variability of the features collapses to zero, and (ii) the between-class feature means are maximally and equally separated. Through the lens of NC, our findings for transfer learning are the following: (i) when pre-training models, preventing intra-class variability collapse (to a certain extent) better preserves the intrinsic structures of the input data, so that it leads to better model transferability; (ii) when fine-tuning models on downstream tasks, obtaining features with more NC on downstream data results in better test accuracy on the given task. The above results not only demystify many widely used heuristics in model pre-training (e.g., data augmentation, projection head, self-supervised learning), but also leads to more efficient and principled fine-tuning method on downstream tasks that we demonstrate through extensive experimental results.

In this work, we address this need by presenting our development of a machine learning-based modeling framework for the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic system. This work represents an improvement over previous efforts, which either focused on the matrix-multiplication mode of BrainScaleS-2 or lacked full automation. Our framework, called hxtorch.snn, enables the hardware-in-the-loop training of spiking neural networks within PyTorch, including support for auto differentiation in a fully-automated hardware experiment workflow. In addition, hxtorch.snn facilitates seamless transitions between emulating on hardware and simulating in software. We demonstrate the capabilities of hxtorch.snn on a classification task using the Yin-Yang dataset employing a gradient-based approach with surrogate gradients and densely sampled membrane observations from the BrainScaleS-2 hardware system.

It is often used to mock or mock someone or something, or to be humorous or amusing. Sarcasm is usually conveyed through tone of voice, facial expressions, or other forms of nonverbal communication, but it can also be indicated by the use of certain words or phrases that are typically associated with irony or humor. Sarcasm detection is difficult because it relies on context and non-verbal cues. It can also be culturally specific, subjective and ambiguous. In this work, we fine-tune the RoBERTa based sarcasm detection model presented in Abaskohi et al. [2022] to get to within 0.02 F1 of the state-of-the-art (Hercog et al. [2022]) on the iSarcasm dataset (Oprea and Magdy [2019]). This performance is achieved by augmenting iSarcasm with a pruned version of the Self Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC) (Khodak et al. [2017]). Our pruned version is 100 times smaller than the subset of SARC used to train the state-of-the-art model. ",

These PDR and latency measures are used to identify both a de-tangled mesh as well as to track the mesh successfully. A de-tangled mesh is a mesh with an anomaly where one or more nodes are separated from the rest of the mesh network. We demonstrate the performance model of a hybrid BLE mesh-PLC network by considering an air cargo monitoring application and validate with experimental PDR and latency data. The link uncertainty in Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh may be attributed to (a) RF interference,(b)~Transmitter's vicinity range, and (c) Receiver sensitivity. In contrast, the link uncertainty in Power Line Communication (PLC) may be attributed to: (a) Colored background noise, (b)~Channel frequency response, and (c) Impulse noise appearing due to load state as well as variations in the powerline. In our work, we construct an equivalent Bayesian network for the mesh to be tracked, capture the uncertainty within the mesh links using the Noisy-OR and the Noisy-Integer addition model and perform belief propagation to detect and localize a network anomaly.

    "abstract": "Neural fields, also known as coordinate-based or implicit neural representations, have shown a remarkable capability of representing, generating, and manipulating various forms of signals. For video representations, however, mapping pixel-wise coordinates to RGB colors has shown relatively low compression performance and slow convergence and inference speed. Frame-wise video representation, which maps a temporal coordinate to its entire frame, has recently emerged as an alternative method to represent videos, improving compression rates and encoding speed. While promising, it has still failed to reach the performance of state-of-the-art video compression algorithms. In this work, we propose FFNeRV, a novel method for incorporating flow information into frame-wise representations to exploit the temporal redundancy across the frames in videos inspired by the standard video codecs. Furthermore, we introduce a fully convolutional architecture, enabled by one-dimensional temporal grids, improving the continuity of spatial features. Experimental results show that FFNeRV yields the best performance for video compression and frame interpolation among the methods using frame-wise representations or neural fields. To reduce the model size even further, we devise a more compact convolutional architecture using the group and pointwise convolutions. With model compression techniques, including quantization-aware training and entropy coding, FFNeRV outperforms widely-used standard video codecs (H.264 and HEVC) and performs on par with state-of-the-art video compression algorithms.

With the development of virtual reality technology, 360{\\deg} omnidirectional image has been widely used, but the SOD task in 360{\\deg} omnidirectional image is seldom studied due to its severe distortions and complex scenes. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Projection Fusion and Refinement Network (MPFR-Net) to detect the salient objects in 360{\\deg} omnidirectional image. Different from the existing methods, the equirectangular projection image and four corresponding cube-unfolding images are embedded into the network simultaneously as inputs, where the cube-unfolding images not only provide supplementary information for equirectangular projection image, but also ensure the object integrity of the cube-map projection. In order to make full use of these two projection modes, a Dynamic Weighting Fusion (DWF) module is designed to adaptively integrate the features of different projections in a complementary and dynamic manner from the perspective of inter and intra features. Furthermore, in order to fully explore the way of interaction between encoder and decoder features, a Filtration and Refinement (FR) module is designed to suppress the redundant information between the feature itself and the feature. Experimental results on two omnidirectional datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. ",

    "abstract": "With more and more data being collected, data-driven modeling methods have been gaining in popularity in recent years. While physically sound, classical gray-box models are often cumbersome to identify and scale, and their accuracy might be hindered by their limited expressiveness. On the other hand, classical black-box methods, typically relying on Neural Networks (NNs) nowadays, often achieve impressive performance, even at scale, by deriving statistical patterns from data. However, they remain completely oblivious to the underlying physical laws, which may lead to potentially catastrophic failures if decisions for real-world physical systems are based on them. Physically Consistent Neural Networks (PCNNs) were recently developed to address these aforementioned issues, ensuring physical consistency while still leveraging NNs to attain state-of-the-art accuracy. In this work, we scale PCNNs to model building temperature dynamics and propose a thorough comparison with classical gray-box and black-box methods. More precisely, we design three distinct PCNN extensions, thereby exemplifying the modularity and flexibility of the architecture, and formally prove their physical consistency. In the presented case study, PCNNs are shown to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, even outperforming classical NN-based models despite their constrained structure. Our investigations furthermore provide a clear illustration of NNs achieving seemingly good performance while remaining completely physics-agnostic, which can be misleading in practice. While this performance comes at the cost of computational complexity, PCNNs on the other hand show accuracy improvements of 17-35% compared to all other physically consistent methods, paving the way for scalable physically consistent models with state-of-the-art performance.

We additionally learn the object-relation joint distribution via energy based modeling. Sampling from this distribution generates a refined graph representation of the image which in turn produces improved detection performance. Experiments on the Visual Genome and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate our method is detector agnostic, end-to-end trainable, and especially beneficial for rare object classes.

However, existing approaches often focus on generalization, without evaluating the model's uncertainty. The ability to compare SSL techniques for improving these estimates is therefore critical for research on the reliability of self-supervision models. In this paper, we explore variants of SSL methods, including Jigsaw Puzzles, Context, Rotation, Geometric Transformations Prediction for vision, as well as BERT and GPT for language tasks. We train SSL in auxiliary learning for vision and pre-training for language model, then evaluate the generalization (in-out classification accuracy) and uncertainty (expected calibration error) across different distribution covariate shift datasets, including MNIST-C, CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-10.1, and MNLI.

However, due to the nonconvexities that arise in power generation systems, there is not yet a fast, robust solution technique for the full Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF). In the last decades, power grids have evolved into a typical dynamic, non-linear and large-scale control system, known as the power system, so searching for better and faster ACOPF solutions is becoming crucial. Appearance of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) has allowed the natural use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms on graph data, such as power networks.

    "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have received remarkable success in link prediction (GNNLP) tasks. Existing efforts first predefine the subgraph for the whole dataset and then apply GNNs to encode edge representations by leveraging the neighborhood structure induced by the fixed subgraph. The prominence of GNNLP methods significantly relies on the adhoc subgraph. Since node connectivity in real-world graphs is complex, one shared subgraph is limited for all edges. Thus, the choices of subgraphs should be personalized to different edges. However, performing personalized subgraph selection is nontrivial since the potential selection space grows exponentially to the scale of edges. Besides, the inference edges are not available during training in link prediction scenarios, so the selection process needs to be inductive. To bridge the gap, we introduce a Personalized Subgraph Selector (PS2) as a plug-and-play framework to automatically, personally, and inductively identify optimal subgraphs for different edges when performing GNNLP. PS2 is instantiated as a bi-level optimization problem that can be efficiently solved differently. Coupling GNNLP models with PS2, we suggest a brand-new angle towards GNNLP training: by first identifying the optimal subgraphs for edges; and then focusing on training the inference model by using the sampled subgraphs. Comprehensive experiments endorse the effectiveness of our proposed method across various GNNLP backbones (GCN, GraphSage, NGCF, LightGCN, and SEAL) and diverse benchmarks (Planetoid, OGB, and Recommendation datasets).

For our constructive proof, we assume that an arbitrary multi-layer ReLU network with or without convolutional layers, batch normalization and max pooling layers was trained to high performance on some training set. Furthermore, we assume that we have access to a representative example of input data used during training and to the exact parameters (weights and biases) of the trained ReLU network. The mapping from deep ReLU networks to SNNs causes zero percent drop in accuracy on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and the ImageNet-like data sets Places365 and PASS. More generally our work shows that an arbitrary deep ReLU network can be replaced by an energy-efficient single-spike neural network without any loss of performance. ",

In this paper we study the possibilities of training acceleration for the numerical resolution of stochastic control problems through gradient descent, where the control is parametrized by a neural network. If the control is applied at many discretization times then solving the stochastic control problem reduces to minimizing the loss of a very deep neural network. We numerically show that Langevin algorithms improve the training on various stochastic control problems like hedging and resource management, and for different choices of gradient descent methods.

    "abstract": "Prognostication for lung cancer, a leading cause of mortality, remains a complex task, as it needs to quantify the associations of risk factors and health events spanning a patient's entire life. One challenge is that an individual's disease course involves non-terminal (e.g., disease progression) and terminal (e.g., death) events, which form semi-competing relationships. Our motivation comes from the Boston Lung Cancer Study, a large lung cancer survival cohort, which investigates how risk factors influence a patient's disease trajectory. Following developments in the prediction of time-to-event outcomes with neural networks, deep learning has become a focal area for the development of risk prediction methods in survival analysis. However, limited work has been done to predict multi-state or semi-competing risk outcomes, where a patient may experience adverse events such as disease progression prior to death. We propose a novel neural expectation-maximization algorithm to bridge the gap between classical statistical approaches and machine learning. Our algorithm enables estimation of the non-parametric baseline hazards of each state transition, risk functions of predictors, and the degree of dependence among different transitions, via a multi-task deep neural network with transition-specific sub-architectures. We apply our method to the Boston Lung Cancer Study and investigate the impact of clinical and genetic predictors on disease progression and mortality. ",

    "abstract": "For small training set sizes $P$, the generalization error of wide neural networks is well-approximated by the error of an infinite width neural network (NN), either in the kernel or mean-field/feature-learning regime. However, after a critical sample size $P^*$, we empirically find the finite-width network generalization becomes worse than that of the infinite width network. In this work, we empirically study the transition from infinite-width behavior to this variance limited regime as a function of sample size $P$ and network width $N$. We find that finite-size effects can become relevant for very small dataset sizes on the order of $P^* \\sim \\sqrt{N}$ for polynomial regression with ReLU networks. We discuss the source of these effects using an argument based on the variance of the NN's final neural tangent kernel (NTK). This transition can be pushed to larger $P$ by enhancing feature learning or by ensemble averaging the networks. We find that the learning curve for regression with the final NTK is an accurate approximation of the NN learning curve. Using this, we provide a toy model which also exhibits $P^* \\sim \\sqrt{N}$ scaling and has $P$-dependent benefits from feature learning. ",

In this paper, we prove the efficacy of the \"Just-in-time\" delivery network through a cluster analysis that extracts and presents the underlying drivers of campaign engagement. We utilize a machine learning methodology with a principal component analysis to organize Fooji campaigns across these principal components. The arrangement of data across the principal component space allows us to expose underlying trends using a $K$-means clustering technique. The most important of these trends is the demonstration of how the \"Just-in-time\" delivery network improves social media engagement. ",

    "abstract": "This work presents a machine learning approach to optimize the energy efficiency (EE) in a multi-cell wireless network. This optimization problem is non-convex and its global optimum is difficult to find. In the literature, either simple but suboptimal approaches or optimal methods with high complexity and poor scalability are proposed. In contrast, we propose a machine learning framework to approach the global optimum. While the neural network (NN) training takes moderate time, application with the trained model requires very low computational complexity. In particular, we introduce a novel objective function based on stochastic actions to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Besides, we design a dedicated NN architecture for the multi-cell network optimization problems that is permutation-equivariant. It classifies channels according to their roles in the EE computation. In this way, we encode our domain knowledge into the NN design and shed light into the black box of machine learning. Training and testing results show that the proposed method without supervision and with reasonable computational effort achieves an EE close to the global optimum found by the branch-and-bound algorithm. Hence, the proposed approach balances between computational complexity and performance. ",

    "abstract": "Applying deep learning concepts from image detection and graph theory has greatly advanced protein-ligand binding affinity prediction, a challenge with enormous ramifications for both drug discovery and protein engineering. We build upon these advances by designing a novel deep learning architecture consisting of a 3-dimensional convolutional neural network utilizing channel-wise attention and two graph convolutional networks utilizing attention-based aggregation of node features. HAC-Net (Hybrid Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Network) obtains state-of-the-art results on the PDBbind v.2016 core set, the most widely recognized benchmark in the field. We extensively assess the generalizability of our model using multiple train-test splits, each of which maximizes differences between either protein structures, protein sequences, or ligand extended-connectivity fingerprints. Furthermore, we perform 10-fold cross-validation with a similarity cutoff between SMILES strings of ligands in the training and test sets, and also evaluate the performance of HAC-Net on lower-quality data. We envision that this model can be extended to a broad range of supervised learning problems related to structure-based biomolecular property prediction.
