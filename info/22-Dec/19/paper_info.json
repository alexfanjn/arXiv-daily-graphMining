    "abstract": "Recently, language representation techniques have achieved great performances in text classification. However, most existing representation models are specifically designed for English materials, which may fail in Chinese because of the huge difference between these two languages. Actually, few existing methods for Chinese text classification process texts at a single level. However, as a special kind of hieroglyphics, radicals of Chinese characters are good semantic carriers. In addition, Pinyin codes carry the semantic of tones, and Wubi reflects the stroke structure information, \\textit{etc}. Unfortunately, previous researches neglected to find an effective way to distill the useful parts of these four factors and to fuse them. In our works, we propose a novel model called Moto: Enhancing Embedding with \\textbf{M}ultiple J\\textbf{o}int Fac\\textbf{to}rs. Specifically, we design an attention mechanism to distill the useful parts by fusing the four-level information above more effectively. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular tasks. The empirical results show that our Moto achieves SOTA 0.8316 ($F_1$-score, 2.11\\% improvement) on Chinese news titles, 96.38 (1.24\\% improvement) on Fudan Corpus and 0.9633 (3.26\\% improvement) on THUCNews.

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based vulnerability detection models have recently been shown to be effective and, in some cases, outperform static analysis tools. However, the highest-performing approaches use token-based transformer models, which do not leverage domain knowledge. Classical program analysis techniques such as dataflow analysis can detect many types of bugs and are the most commonly used methods in practice. Motivated by the causal relationship between bugs and dataflow analysis, we present DeepDFA, a dataflow analysis-guided graph learning framework and embedding that uses program semantic features for vulnerability detection. We show that DeepDFA is performant and efficient. DeepDFA ranked first in recall, first in generalizing over unseen projects, and second in F1 among all the state-of-the-art models we experimented with. It is also the smallest model in terms of the number of parameters, and was trained in 9 minutes, 69x faster than the highest-performing baseline. DeepDFA can be used with other models. By integrating LineVul and DeepDFA, we achieved the best vulnerability detection performance of 96.4 F1 score, 98.69 precision, and 94.22 recall. ",

Although many great models have been proposed, we do not yet have a good understanding of these models. This limits the further advancement of model robustness, debugging, and deployment for the vulnerability detection. In this paper, we surveyed and reproduced 9 state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models on 2 widely used vulnerability detection datasets: Devign and MSR. We investigated 6 research questions in three areas, namely model capabilities, training data, and model interpretation. We experimentally demonstrated the variability between different runs of a model and the low agreement among different models' outputs. We investigated models trained for specific types of vulnerabilities compared to a model that is trained on all the vulnerabilities at once. We explored the types of programs DL may consider \"hard\" to handle. We investigated the relations of training data sizes and training data composition with model performance. Finally, we studied model interpretations and analyzed important features that the models used to make predictions. We believe that our findings can help better understand model results, provide guidance on preparing training data, and improve the robustness of the models.

Load models are usually of secondary importance compared to generation source models, but as the results show, they play a crucial role in stability studies with the introduction of inverter-based resources. Given inverter control time scales, the implications of considering or neglecting electromagnetic transients of the network are very relevant in the stability assessments. In this paper, we perform eigenvalue analyses for inverter-based resources and synchronous machines connected to a load and explore the effects of multiples models under different network representations. We explore maximum loadability of inverter-based resources and synchronous machines, while analyzing the effects of load and network dynamic models on small-signal stability. The results show that the network representation plays a fundamental role in the stability of the system of different load models.

We present three methods that exploit the induced graphon representation of graphs and graph signals on partitions of [0, 1]2 in the graphon space. As a result we derive low dimensional representations of the convolutional operators, while a dimensionality reduction of the signals is achieved by simple local interpolation of functions in L2([0, 1]). We prove that those low dimensional representations constitute a convergent sequence of graphs and graph signals, respectively. The methods proposed and the theoretical guarantees that we provide show that the reduced graphs and signals inherit spectral-structural properties of the original quantities. We evaluate our approach with a set of numerical experiments performed on graph neural networks (GNNs) that rely on graphon pooling. We observe that graphon pooling performs significantly better than other approaches proposed in the literature when dimensionality reduction ratios between layers are large. We also observe that when graphon pooling is used we have, in general, less overfitting and lower computational cost. ",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning refers to the transfer of knowledge or information from a relevant source domain to a target domain. However, most existing transfer learning theories and algorithms focus on IID tasks, where the source/target samples are assumed to be independent and identically distributed. Very little effort is devoted to theoretically studying the knowledge transferability on non-IID tasks, e.g., cross-network mining. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we propose rigorous generalization bounds and algorithms for cross-network transfer learning from a source graph to a target graph. The crucial idea is to characterize the cross-network knowledge transferability from the perspective of the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. To this end, we propose a novel Graph Subtree Discrepancy to measure the graph distribution shift between source and target graphs. Then the generalization error bounds on cross-network transfer learning, including both cross-network node classification and link prediction tasks, can be derived in terms of the source knowledge and the Graph Subtree Discrepancy across domains. This thereby motivates us to propose a generic graph adaptive network (GRADE) to minimize the distribution shift between source and target graphs for cross-network transfer learning. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our GRADE framework on both cross-network node classification and cross-domain recommendation tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable success achieved by graph convolutional networks for functional brain activity analysis, the heterogeneity of functional patterns and the scarcity of imaging data still pose challenges in many tasks. Transferring knowledge from a source domain with abundant training data to a target domain is effective for improving representation learning on scarce training data. However, traditional transfer learning methods often fail to generalize the pre-trained knowledge to the target task due to domain discrepancy. Self-supervised learning on graphs can increase the generalizability of graph features since self-supervision concentrates on inherent graph properties that are not limited to a particular supervised task. We propose a novel knowledge transfer strategy by integrating meta-learning with self-supervised learning to deal with the heterogeneity and scarcity of fMRI data. Specifically, we perform a self-supervised task on the source domain and apply meta-learning, which strongly improves the generalizability of the model using the bi-level optimization, to transfer the self-supervised knowledge to the target domain. Through experiments on a neurological disorder classification task, we demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly improves target task performance by increasing the generalizability and transferability of graph-based knowledge.

Users are utilizing LBS by providing their location information to third-party service providers. However, location data is very sensitive that can reveal user's private life to adversaries. The passive and pervasive data collection in IoT upsurges serious issues of location privacy. Privacy-preserving location-based services are a hot research topic. Many anonymization and obfuscation techniques have been proposed to overcome location privacy issues. In this paper, we have proposed a hybrid location privacy scheme (H-LPS), a hybrid scheme mainly based on obfuscation and collaboration for protecting users' location privacy while using location-based services. Obfuscation naturally degrades the quality of service but provides more privacy as compared to anonymization. Our proposed scheme, H-LPS, provides a very high-level of privacy yet provides good accuracy for most of the users. The privacy level and service accuracy of H-LPS are compared with state-of-the-art location privacy schemes and it is shown that H-LPS could be a candidate solution for preserving user location privacy in location-based services.

In this work, we introduce robust saliency guidance for DFCIL and propose a new framework, which we call RObust Saliency Supervision (ROSS), for mitigating the negative effect of saliency drift. Firstly, we use a teacher-student architecture leveraging low-level tasks to supervise the model with global saliency. We also apply boundary-guided saliency to protect it from drifting across object boundaries at intermediate layers. Finally, we introduce a module for injecting and recovering saliency noise to increase robustness of saliency preservation.

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation is an important task to predict the next-item to access based on a sequence of interacted items. Most existing works learn user preference as the transition pattern from the previous item to the next one, ignoring the time interval between these two items. However, we observe that the time interval in a sequence may vary significantly different, and thus result in the ineffectiveness of user modeling due to the issue of \\emph{preference drift}. In fact, we conducted an empirical study to validate this observation, and found that a sequence with uniformly distributed time interval (denoted as uniform sequence) is more beneficial for performance improvement than that with greatly varying time interval. Therefore, we propose to augment sequence data from the perspective of time interval, which is not studied in the literature. Specifically, we design five operators (Ti-Crop, Ti-Reorder, Ti-Mask, Ti-Substitute, Ti-Insert) to transform the original non-uniform sequence to uniform sequence with the consideration of variance of time intervals. Then, we devise a control strategy to execute data augmentation on item sequences in different lengths. Finally, we implement these improvements on a state-of-the-art model CoSeRec and validate our approach on four real datasets.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enables geographically dispersed edge devices (i.e., clients) to learn a global model without sharing the local datasets, where each client performs gradient descent with its local data and uploads the gradients to a central server to update the global model. However, FL faces massive communication overhead resulted from uploading the gradients in each training round. To address this problem, most existing research compresses the gradients with fixed and unified quantization for all the clients, which neither seeks adaptive quantization due to the varying gradient norms at different rounds, nor exploits the heterogeneity of the clients to accelerate FL. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive and heterogeneous gradient quantization algorithm (AdaGQ) for FL to minimize the wall-clock training time from two aspects: i) adaptive quantization which exploits the change of gradient norm to adjust the quantization resolution in each training round; and ii) heterogeneous quantization which assigns lower quantization resolution to slow clients to align their training time with other clients to mitigate the communication bottleneck, and higher quantization resolution to fast clients to achieve a better communication efficiency and accuracy tradeoff. Evaluations based on various models and datasets validate the benefits of AdaGQ, reducing the total training time by up to 52.1% compared to baseline algorithms (e.g., FedAvg, QSGD). ",

    "abstract": "Traffic analysis attacks can counteract end-to-end encryption and use the leaked communication metadata to reveal information about the communicating parties. With an ever-increasing amount of traffic by an ever-increasing amount of networked devices, this undermines communication privacy and goes against the uptrend of limiting personal data collection. Therefore, Anonymous Communication Systems (ACSs) are proposed to protect the users' privacy by hiding the relationship between transmitted messages and their senders and receivers, providing privacy properties known as anonymity, unlinkability and unobservability. This article aims to review the research in the ACSs field based on its applicability in real-world scenarios. First, we present an overview of the underlying principles of ACSs and different methods. Then, we focus on Dining Cryptographers Networks (DCNs) and the methods for anonymous communication that are based on them. We investigate the alignment of ACSs with the privacy terminologies. Most notably, the DCN-based methods are information-theoretically secure and thus provide unconditional unobservability guarantees. Their initial adoption for anonymous communications was hindered initially as their computational and communication overhead was deemed too significant at that time and scalability problems occurred. However, several more recent contributions such as the possibility to transmit arbitrary length messages, efficient handling of disruptors and improvements in overhead made the integration of modern DCN-based methods more realistic. Previous surveys on ACSs did not cover the most recent research advances in this area or did not focus on DCN-based methods. This comprehensive investigation of modern ACSs and DCN-based systems closes this gap. ",

    "abstract": "Recent methods in self-supervised learning have demonstrated that masking-based pretext tasks extend beyond NLP, serving as useful pretraining objectives in computer vision. However, existing approaches apply random or ad hoc masking strategies that limit the difficulty of the reconstruction task and, consequently, the strength of the learnt representations. We improve upon current state-of-the-art work in learning adversarial masks by proposing a new framework that generates masks in a sequential fashion with different constraints on the adversary. This leads to improvements in performance on various downstream tasks, such as classification on ImageNet100, STL10, and CIFAR10/100 and segmentation on Pascal VOC. Our results further demonstrate the promising capabilities of masking-based approaches for SSL in computer vision. ",

    "abstract": "Image-text retrieval (ITR) is a challenging task in the field of multimodal information processing due to the semantic gap between different modalities. In recent years, researchers have made great progress in exploring the accurate alignment between image and text. However, existing works mainly focus on the fine-grained alignment between image regions and sentence fragments, which ignores the guiding significance of context background information. Actually, integrating the local fine-grained information and global context background information can provide more semantic clues for retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Alignment Network (HGAN) for image-text retrieval. First, to capture the comprehensive multimodal features, we construct the feature graphs for the image and text modality respectively. Then, a multi-granularity shared space is established with a designed Multi-granularity Feature Aggregation and Rearrangement (MFAR) module, which enhances the semantic corresponding relations between the local and global information, and obtains more accurate feature representations for the image and text modalities. Finally, the ultimate image and text features are further refined through three-level similarity functions to achieve the hierarchical alignment. To justify the proposed model, we perform extensive experiments on MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed HGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of our model. ",

    "abstract": "Script is a kind of structured knowledge extracted from texts, which contains a sequence of events. Based on such knowledge, script event prediction aims to predict the subsequent event. To do so, two aspects should be considered for events, namely, event description (i.e., what the events should contain) and event encoding (i.e., how they should be encoded). Most existing methods describe an event by a verb together with only a few core arguments (i.e., subject, object, and indirect object), which are not precise. In addition, existing event encoders are limited to a fixed number of arguments, which are not flexible to deal with extra information. Thus, in this paper, we propose the Rich Event Prediction (REP) framework for script event prediction. Fundamentally, it is based on the proposed rich event description, which enriches the existing ones with three kinds of important information, namely, the senses of verbs, extra semantic roles, and types of participants. REP contains an event extractor to extract such information from texts. Based on the extracted rich information, a predictor then selects the most probable subsequent event. The core component of the predictor is a transformer-based event encoder to flexibly deal with an arbitrary number of arguments. Experimental results on the widely used Gigaword Corpus show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. ",

    "abstract": "Camouflaged objects are seamlessly blended in with their surroundings, which brings a challenging detection task in computer vision. Optimizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for camouflaged object detection (COD) tends to activate local discriminative regions while ignoring complete object extent, causing the partial activation issue which inevitably leads to missing or redundant regions of objects. In this paper, we argue that partial activation is caused by the intrinsic characteristics of CNN, where the convolution operations produce local receptive fields and experience difficulty to capture long-range feature dependency among image regions. In order to obtain feature maps that could activate full object extent, keeping the segmental results from being overwhelmed by noisy features, a novel framework termed Cross-Model Detail Querying network (DQnet) is proposed. It reasons the relations between long-range-aware representations and multi-scale local details to make the enhanced representation fully highlight the object regions and eliminate noise on non-object regions. Specifically, a vanilla ViT pretrained with self-supervised learning (SSL) is employed to model long-range dependencies among image regions. A ResNet is employed to enable learning fine-grained spatial local details in multiple scales. Then, to effectively retrieve object-related details, a Relation-Based Querying (RBQ) module is proposed to explore window-based interactions between the global representations and the multi-scale local details. Extensive experiments are conducted on the widely used COD datasets and show that our DQnet outperforms the current state-of-the-arts. ",

Therefore, a domain-decomposition multi-network model is proposed to deal with the discontinuities in the strain fields at common boundaries of pile-soil regions and soil layers. The application of the model to the analysis and parametric study of single piles embedded in both homogeneous and layered formations is demonstrated under axisymmetric and plane strain conditions. The performance of the model in parameter identification (inverse analysis) of pile-soil interaction is particularly investigated. It is shown that by using PINNs, the localized data acquired along the pile length - possibly obtained via fiber optic strain sensing - can be successfully used for the inversion of soil parameters in layered formations.

Despite their many advantages, FA-enabled communications have limitations as they require an enormous amount of spectral resources in order to select the most desirable position of the radiating element from a large number of prescribed locations. In this paper, we present an analytical framework for the outage performance of large-scale FA-enabled communications, where all user equipments (UEs) employ circular multi-FA array. In contrast to existing studies, which assume perfect channel state information, the developed framework accurately captures the channel estimation errors on the performance of the considered network deployments. In particular, we focus on the limited coherence interval scenario, where a novel sequential linear minimum mean-squared error (LMMSE)-based channel estimation method is performed for only a very small number of FA ports. Next, for the communication of each BS with its associated UE, a low-complexity port-selection technique is employed, where the port that provides the highest signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio is selected among the ports that are estimated to provide the strongest channel from each FA. By using stochastic geometry tools, we derive both analytical and closed-form expressions for the outage probability, highlighting the impact of channel estimation on the performance of FA-based UEs. Our results reveal the trade-off imposed between improving the network's performance and reducing the channel estimation quality, indicating new insights for the design of FA-enabled communications.

This promotes the potential of utilizing models pretrained with data more than 3D as teachers for cross-modal knowledge transferring. In this paper, we revisit masked modeling in a unified fashion of knowledge distillation, and we show that foundational Transformers pretrained with 2D images or natural languages can help self-supervised 3D representation learning through training Autoencoders as Cross-Modal Teachers (ACT). The pretrained Transformers are transferred as cross-modal 3D teachers using discrete variational autoencoding self-supervision, during which the Transformers are frozen with prompt tuning for better knowledge inheritance. The latent features encoded by the 3D teachers are used as the target of masked point modeling, wherein the dark knowledge is distilled to the 3D Transformer students as foundational geometry understanding.

To address these issues, we propose a novel Reliable Causal chain reasoning framework~(ReCo), which introduces exogenous variables to represent the threshold and scene factors of each causal pair within the causal chain, and estimates the threshold and scene contradictions across exogenous variables via structural causal recurrent neural networks~(SRNN). Experiments show that ReCo outperforms a series of strong baselines on both Chinese and English CCR datasets. Moreover, by injecting reliable causal chain knowledge distilled by ReCo, BERT can achieve better performances on four downstream causal-related tasks than BERT models enhanced by other kinds of knowledge.

However, NeRF faces challenges in practical applications, such as large-scale scenes and edge devices with a limited amount of memory, where data needs to be processed sequentially. Under such incremental learning scenarios, neural networks are known to suffer catastrophic forgetting: easily forgetting previously seen data after training with new data. We observe that previous incremental learning algorithms are limited by either low performance or memory scalability issues. As such, we develop a Memory-Efficient Incremental Learning algorithm for NeRF (MEIL-NeRF). MEIL-NeRF takes inspiration from NeRF itself in that a neural network can serve as a memory that provides the pixel RGB values, given rays as queries. Upon the motivation, our framework learns which rays to query NeRF to extract previous pixel values. The extracted pixel values are then used to train NeRF in a self-distillation manner to prevent catastrophic forgetting. As a result, MEIL-NeRF demonstrates constant memory consumption and competitive performance. ",

    "abstract": "Attention-based neural networks, such as Transformers, have become ubiquitous in numerous applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and time-series analysis. In all kinds of attention networks, the attention maps are crucial as they encode semantic dependencies between input tokens. However, most existing attention networks perform modeling or reasoning based on representations, wherein the attention maps of different layers are learned separately without explicit interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic evolving attention mechanism, which directly models the evolution of inter-token relationships through a chain of residual convolutional modules. The major motivations are twofold. On the one hand, the attention maps in different layers share transferable knowledge, thus adding a residual connection can facilitate the information flow of inter-token relationships across layers. On the other hand, there is naturally an evolutionary trend among attention maps at different abstraction levels, so it is beneficial to exploit a dedicated convolution-based module to capture this process. Equipped with the proposed mechanism, the convolution-enhanced evolving attention networks achieve superior performance in various applications, including time-series representation, natural language understanding, machine translation, and image classification. Especially on time-series representation tasks, Evolving Attention-enhanced Dilated Convolutional (EA-DC-) Transformer outperforms state-of-the-art models significantly, achieving an average of 17% improvement compared to the best SOTA. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly models the layer-wise evolution of attention maps.

    "abstract": "Algorithmic solutions for multi-object tracking (MOT) are a key enabler for applications in autonomous navigation and applied ocean sciences. State-of-the-art MOT methods fully rely on a statistical model and typically use preprocessed sensor data as measurements. In particular, measurements are produced by a detector that extracts potential object locations from the raw sensor data collected for a discrete time step. This preparatory processing step reduces data flow and computational complexity but may result in a loss of information. State-of-the-art Bayesian MOT methods that are based on belief propagation (BP) systematically exploit graph structures of the statistical model to reduce computational complexity and improve scalability. However, as a fully model-based approach, BP can only provide suboptimal estimates when there is a mismatch between the statistical model and the true data-generating process. Existing BP-based MOT methods can further only make use of preprocessed measurements. In this paper, we introduce a variant of BP that combines model-based with data-driven MOT. The proposed neural enhanced belief propagation (NEBP) method complements the statistical model of BP by information learned from raw sensor data. This approach conjectures that the learned information can reduce model mismatch and thus improve data association and false alarm rejection. Our NEBP method improves tracking performance compared to model-based methods. At the same time, it inherits the advantages of BP-based MOT, i.e., it scales only quadratically in the number of objects, and it can thus generate and maintain a large number of object tracks. We evaluate the performance of our NEBP approach for MOT on the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance. ",

Researchers have proposed various defense methods to protect DNNs, such as reducing the aggressiveness of adversarial examples by preprocessing or improving the robustness of the model by adding modules. However, some defense methods are only effective for small-scale examples or small perturbations but have limited defense effects for adversarial examples with large perturbations. This paper assigns different defense strategies to adversarial perturbations of different strengths by grading the perturbations on the input examples. Experimental results show that the proposed method effectively improves defense performance.

The goal of this paper is to construct PINNs along with a computable upper bound of the error, which is particularly relevant for model reduction of Parameterized PDEs (PPDEs). To this end, we suggest to use a weighted sum of expansion coefficients of the residual in terms of an adaptive wavelet expansion both for the loss function and an error bound. This approach is shown here for elliptic PPDEs using both the standard variational and an optimally stable ultra-weak formulation.

This insight is commonly based on research conducted by researchers and on developer populations living and working in the United States, Europe, and the United Kingdom. However, the production of software is global, and crucial populations in important technology hubs are not adequately studied. The software startup scene in Turkey is impactful, and comprehension, knowledge, and mitigations related to software security and privacy remain understudied. To close this research gap, we conducted a semi-structured interview study with 16 developers working in Turkish software startups. The goal of the interview study was to analyze if and how developers ensure that their software is secure and preserves user privacy. Our main finding is that developers rarely prioritize security and privacy, due to a lack of awareness, skills, and resources. We find that regulations can make a positive impact on security and privacy. Based on the study, we issue recommendations for industry, individual developers, research, educators, and regulators. Our recommendations can inform a more globalized approach to security and privacy in software development. ",

Unlike existing adaptive solutions, the system state-space matrices A, B are not restricted to be represented in the observer canonical form to implement the observer. The original system description is used instead, and, consequently, the original state vector is obtained. The class of systems for which the method is applicable is identified via three assumptions related to: (i) the identifiability of the unique parameters of A and B from the characteristic polynomials of output transfer function and the fact that we know mappings (ii) from such polynomials parameters to unique parameters of A and B and (iii) from them to Luenberger correction gain. In case they are met and the regressor is finitely exciting, the proposed adaptive observer, which is based on the known GPEBO and DREM procedures, ensures exponential convergence of both system parameters and states estimates to their true values. Detailed analysis for stability and convergence has been provided along with simulation results to validate the developed theory. ",

In this sense, many companies have started to control and restrict access to their data using authentication systems. However, these traditional authentication methods, are not enough for ensuring data protection, and for this reason, behavioral biometrics have gained importance. Despite their promising results and the wide range of applications, biometric systems have shown to be vulnerable to malicious attacks, such as Presentation Attacks. For this reason, in this work, we propose to study a new approach aiming to deploy a presentation attack towards a keystroke authentication system. Our idea is to use Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGAN) for generating synthetic keystroke data that can be used for impersonating an authorized user. These synthetic data are generated following two different real use cases, one in which the order of the typed words is known (ordered dynamic) and the other in which this order is unknown (no-ordered dynamic). Finally, both keystroke dynamics (ordered and no-ordered) are validated using an external keystroke authentication system. Results indicate that the cGAN can effectively generate keystroke dynamics patterns that can be used for deceiving keystroke authentication systems. ",

    "abstract": "Single-frame InfraRed Small Target (SIRST) detection has been a challenging task due to a lack of inherent characteristics, imprecise bounding box regression, a scarcity of real-world datasets, and sensitive localization evaluation. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive solution to these challenges. First, we find that the existing anchor-free label assignment method is prone to mislabeling small targets as background, leading to their omission by detectors. To overcome this issue, we propose an all-scale pseudo-box-based label assignment scheme that relaxes the constraints on scale and decouples the spatial assignment from the size of the ground-truth target. Second, motivated by the structured prior of feature pyramids, we introduce the one-stage cascade refinement network (OSCAR), which uses the high-level head as soft proposals for the low-level refinement head. This allows OSCAR to process the same target in a cascade coarse-to-fine manner. Finally, we present a new research benchmark for infrared small target detection, consisting of the SIRST-V2 dataset of real-world, high-resolution single-frame targets, the normalized contrast evaluation metric, and the DeepInfrared toolkit for detection. We conduct extensive ablation studies to evaluate the components of OSCAR and compare its performance to state-of-the-art model-driven and data-driven methods on the SIRST-V2 benchmark. Our results demonstrate that a top-down cascade refinement framework can improve the accuracy of infrared small target detection without sacrificing efficiency. The DeepInfrared toolkit, dataset, and trained models are available at https://github.com/YimianDai/open-deepinfrared to advance further research in this field. ",

We address this limitation using a novel method for predicting the best answers using the questioner's background information and other features, such as the textual content or the relationships with other participants. Our answer classification model was trained using the Stack Exchange dataset and validated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric. The experimental results show that the proposed method complements previous methods by pointing out the importance of the relationships between users, particularly throughout the level of involvement in different communities on Stack Exchange. Furthermore, we point out that there is little overlap between user-relation information and the information represented by the shallow text features and the meta-features, such as time differences.

    "abstract": "Social insects such as ants communicate via pheromones which allows them to coordinate their activity and solve complex tasks as a swarm, e.g. foraging for food. This behaviour was shaped through evolutionary processes. In computational models, self-coordination in swarms has been implemented using probabilistic or action rules to shape the decision of each agent and the collective behaviour. However, manual tuned decision rules may limit the behaviour of the swarm. In this work we investigate the emergence of self-coordination and communication in evolved swarms without defining any rule. We evolve a swarm of agents representing an ant colony. We use a genetic algorithm to optimize a spiking neural network (SNN) which serves as an artificial brain to control the behaviour of each agent. The goal of the colony is to find optimal ways to forage for food in the shortest amount of time. In the evolutionary phase, the ants are able to learn to collaborate by depositing pheromone near food piles and near the nest to guide its cohorts. The pheromone usage is not encoded into the network; instead, this behaviour is established through the optimization procedure. We observe that pheromone-based communication enables the ants to perform better in comparison to colonies where communication did not emerge. We assess the foraging performance by comparing the SNN based model to a rule based system. Our results show that the SNN based model can complete the foraging task more efficiently in a shorter time. Our approach illustrates that even in the absence of pre-defined rules, self coordination via pheromone emerges as a result of the network optimization. This work serves as a proof of concept for the possibility of creating complex applications utilizing SNNs as underlying architectures for multi-agent interactions where communication and self-coordination is desired.

By propagating a compact input or parameter set as symbolic intervals through the forwards and backwards computations of the neural network we can formally certify the robustness of gradient-based explanations. Our bounds are differentiable, hence we can incorporate provable explanation robustness into neural network training. Empirically, our method surpasses the robustness provided by previous heuristic approaches.

After highlighting the problem, we propose the AraCWA model to mitigate the performance deterioration when detecting check-worthy claims across topics. The AraCWA model enables boosting the performance for new topics by incorporating two components for few-shot learning and data augmentation. Using a publicly available dataset of Arabic tweets consisting of 14 different topics, we demonstrate that our proposed data augmentation strategy achieves substantial improvements across topics overall, where the extent of the improvement varies across topics. Further, we analyse the semantic similarities between topics, suggesting that the similarity metric could be used as a proxy to determine the difficulty level of an unseen topic prior to undertaking the task of labelling the underlying sentences.

We augment the task demonstrations with a set of task-dependent parameters representing spatial properties of each motion and use them to train the EQLN. At run time, the features are used to query the Task-Parameterized Equation Learner Network (TP-EQLN) and generate the corresponding robot trajectory. The set of features encodes kinematic constraints of the task such as desired height or a final point to reach. We validate the results of our approach on manipulation tasks where it is important to preserve the shape of the motion in the extrapolation domain. Our approach is also compared with existing state-of-the-art approaches, in simulation and in real setups.

[2020] proved there are set-aggregation problems for which summing cannot generalise to unbounded inputs, proposing recurrent neural networks regularised towards permutation-invariance as a more expressive aggregator. We show that these results carry over to the graph domain: GNNs equipped with recurrent aggregators are competitive with state-of-the-art permutation-invariant aggregators, on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world problems. However, despite the benefits of recurrent aggregators, their $O(V)$ depth makes them both difficult to parallelise and harder to train on large graphs. Inspired by the observation that a well-behaved aggregator for a GNN is a commutative monoid over its latent space, we propose a framework for constructing learnable, commutative, associative binary operators. And with this, we construct an aggregator of $O(\\log V)$ depth, yielding exponential improvements for both parallelism and dependency length while achieving performance competitive with recurrent aggregators. Based on our empirical observations, our proposed learnable commutative monoid (LCM) aggregator represents a favourable tradeoff between efficient and expressive aggregators. ",

A large class of recent algorithms for proving input-output relations of feed-forward neural networks are based on linear relaxations and symbolic interval propagation. However, due to variable dependencies, the approximations deteriorate with increasing depth of the network. In this paper we present DPNeurifyFV, a novel branch-and-bound solver for ReLU networks with low dimensional input-space that is based on symbolic interval propagation with fresh variables and input-splitting. A new heuristic for choosing the fresh variables allows to ameliorate the dependency problem, while our novel splitting heuristic, in combination with several other improvements, speeds up the branch-and-bound procedure. We evaluate our approach on the airborne collision avoidance networks ACAS Xu and demonstrate runtime improvements compared to state-of-the-art tools. ",

    "abstract": "Automatic defect detection for 3D printing processes, which shares many characteristics with change detection problems, is a vital step for quality control of 3D printed products. However, there are some critical challenges in the current state of practice. First, existing methods for computer vision-based process monitoring typically work well only under specific camera viewpoints and lighting situations, requiring expensive pre-processing, alignment, and camera setups. Second, many defect detection techniques are specific to pre-defined defect patterns and/or print schematics. In this work, we approach the automatic defect detection problem differently using a novel Semi-Siamese deep learning model that directly compares a reference schematic of the desired print and a camera image of the achieved print. The model then solves an image segmentation problem, identifying the locations of defects with respect to the reference frame. Unlike most change detection problems, our model is specially developed to handle images coming from different domains and is robust against perturbations in the imaging setup such as camera angle and illumination. Defect localization predictions were made in 2.75 seconds per layer using a standard MacBookPro, which is comparable to the typical tens of seconds or less for printing a single layer on an inkjet-based 3D printer, while achieving an F1-score of more than 0.9.

    "abstract": "Risk communication in times of disasters is complex, involving rapid and diverse communication in social networks (i.e., public and/or private agencies; local residents) as well as limited mobilization capacity and operational constraints of physical infrastructure networks. Despite a growing literature on infrastructure interdependencies and co-dependent social-physical systems, an in-depth understanding of how risk communication in online social networks weighs into physical infrastructure networks during a major disaster remains limited, let alone in compounding risk events. This study analyzes large-scale datasets of crisis mobility and activity-related social interactions and concerns available through social media (Twitter) for communities that were impacted by an ice storm (Oct. 2020) in Oklahoma. Compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, Oklahoma residents faced this historic ice storm (Oct. 26, 2020-Oct. 29, 2020) that caused devastating traffic impacts (among others) due to excessive ice accumulation. By using the recently released academic Application Programming Interface (API) by Twitter that provides complete and unbiased data, geotagged tweets (approx. 210K) were collected covering the entire state of Oklahoma, and ice storm-related tweets (approx. 14.2K) were considered. First, the study uses natural language processing and text quantification techniques to translate crisis narratives (i.e., tweets). Next, geo-tagged tweets are mapped into co-located road networks using traditional GIS techniques. Finally, insights are generated using network science theories and quantified social narratives to interpret different elements of road networks (e.g., local roads, freeways, etc.) for the Oklahoma communities that were impacted by the ice storm event during the pandemic.

In particular, we find a spanning set of matrices for the learnable, linear, equivariant layer functions between such tensor power spaces in the standard basis of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ when the group is $O(n)$ or $SO(n)$, and in the symplectic basis of $\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ when the group is $Sp(n)$.

We also describe how our approach generalises to the construction of neural networks that are equivariant to local symmetries. The theoretical background for our results comes from the Schur-Weyl dualities that were established by Brauer in his 1937 paper \"On Algebras Which are Connected with the Semisimple Continuous Groups\" for each of the three groups in question.

Consequently, the localization and mapping performance is impacted, thereby rendering navigation in such environments unreliable. Optimization-based SLAM solutions, which are also referred to as Graph SLAM, are widely regarded as state of the art. In this paper, we utilize a simple and computationally inexpensive glass detection scheme for detecting glass objects and present the methodology to incorporate the identified objects into the occupancy grid maintained by such an algorithm (Google Cartographer).

CIRCE applies as a regularizer in settings where we wish to learn neural features $\\varphi(X)$ of data $X$ to estimate a target $Y$, while being conditionally independent of a distractor $Z$ given $Y$. Both $Z$ and $Y$ are assumed to be continuous-valued but relatively low dimensional, whereas $X$ and its features may be complex and high dimensional. Relevant settings include domain-invariant learning, fairness, and causal learning. The procedure requires just a single ridge regression from $Y$ to kernelized features of $Z$, which can be done in advance. It is then only necessary to enforce independence of $\\varphi(X)$ from residuals of this regression, which is possible with attractive estimation properties and consistency guarantees. By contrast, earlier measures of conditional feature dependence require multiple regressions for each step of feature learning, resulting in more severe bias and variance, and greater computational cost. When sufficiently rich features are used, we establish that CIRCE is zero if and only if $\\varphi(X) \\perp \\!\\!\\! \\perp Z \\mid Y$.

    "abstract": "It is no secret that deep learning models exhibit undesirable behaviors such as learning spurious correlations instead of learning correct relationships between input/output pairs. Prior works on robustness study datasets that mix low-level features to quantify how spurious correlations affect predictions instead of considering natural semantic factors due to limitations in accessing realistic datasets for comprehensive evaluation. To bridge this gap, in this paper we first investigate how natural background colors play a role as spurious features in image classification tasks by manually splitting the test sets of CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 into subgroups based on the background color of each image. We name our datasets CIFAR10-B and CIFAR100-B. We find that while standard CNNs achieve human-level accuracy, the subgroup performances are not consistent, and the phenomenon remains even after data augmentation (DA). To alleviate this issue, we propose FlowAug, a semantic DA method that leverages the decoupled semantic representations captured by a pre-trained generative flow. Experimental results show that FlowAug achieves more consistent results across subgroups than other types of DA methods on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Additionally, it shows better generalization performance. Furthermore, we propose a generic metric for studying model robustness to spurious correlations, where we take a macro average on the weighted standard deviations across different classes. Per our metric, FlowAug demonstrates less reliance on spurious correlations. Although this metric is proposed to study our curated datasets, it applies to all datasets that have subgroups or subclasses. Lastly, aside from less dependence on spurious correlations and better generalization on in-distribution test sets, we also show superior out-of-distribution results on CIFAR10.1 and competitive performances on CIFAR10-C and CIFAR100-C.

We argue that previous studies did not take into account the peculiarity of medical diagnosis, like the co-occurrence of diseases, the disagreement of labellers (domain experts), the threat model of the attacks and the risk implications for each successful attack. In this paper, we discuss the methodological foundations, review the pitfalls and best practices, and suggest new methodological considerations for evaluating the robustness of chest xray classification models. Our evaluation on 3 datasets, 7 models, and 18 diseases is the largest evaluation of robustness of chest x-ray classification models. ",

    "abstract": "Dengue fever is a virulent disease spreading over 100 tropical and subtropical countries in Africa, the Americas, and Asia. This arboviral disease affects around 400 million people globally, severely distressing the healthcare systems. The unavailability of a specific drug and ready-to-use vaccine makes the situation worse. Hence, policymakers must rely on early warning systems to control intervention-related decisions. Forecasts routinely provide critical information for dangerous epidemic events. However, the available forecasting models (e.g., weather-driven mechanistic, statistical time series, and machine learning models) lack a clear understanding of different components to improve prediction accuracy and often provide unstable and unreliable forecasts. This study proposes an ensemble wavelet neural network with exogenous factor(s) (XEWNet) model that can produce reliable estimates for dengue outbreak prediction for three geographical regions, namely San Juan, Iquitos, and Ahmedabad. The proposed XEWNet model is flexible and can easily incorporate exogenous climate variable(s) confirmed by statistical causality tests in its scalable framework. The proposed model is an integrated approach that uses wavelet transformation into an ensemble neural network framework that helps in generating more reliable long-term forecasts. The proposed XEWNet allows complex non-linear relationships between the dengue incidence cases and rainfall; however, mathematically interpretable, fast in execution, and easily comprehensible. The proposal's competitiveness is measured using computational experiments based on various statistical metrics and several statistical comparison tests. In comparison with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning methods, our proposed XEWNet performs better in 75% of the cases for short-term and long-term forecasting of dengue incidence. ",

While existing methods bin acquired data from neighboring time points to reconstruct one phase of the cardiac motion, our framework allows for a continuous, binning-free, and subject-specific k-space representation.We assign a unique coordinate that consists of time, coil index, and frequency domain location to each sampled k-space point. We then learn the subject-specific mapping from these unique coordinates to k-space intensities using a multi-layer perceptron with frequency domain regularization. During inference, we obtain a complete k-space for Cartesian coordinates and an arbitrary temporal resolution. A simple inverse Fourier transform recovers the image, eliminating the need for density compensation and costly non-uniform Fourier transforms for non-Cartesian data. This novel imaging framework was tested on 42 radially sampled datasets from 6 subjects. The proposed method outperforms other techniques qualitatively and quantitatively using data from four and one heartbeat(s) and 30 cardiac phases. Our results for one heartbeat reconstruction of 50 cardiac phases show improved artifact removal and spatio-temporal resolution, leveraging the potential for real-time CMR. ",

Evaluating vaccine allocation is therefore a crucial element of pandemics response. In the present work, we develop a model to retrospectively evaluate age-dependent counterfactual vaccine allocation strategies against the COVID-19 pandemic. To estimate the effect of allocation on the expected severe-case incidence, we employ a simulation-assisted causal modelling approach which combines a compartmental infection-dynamics simulation, a coarse-grained, data-driven causal model and literature estimates for immunity waning. We compare Israel's implemented vaccine allocation strategy in 2021 to counterfactual strategies such as no prioritisation, prioritisation of younger age groups or a strict risk-ranked approach; we find that Israel's implemented strategy was indeed highly effective. We also study the marginal impact of increasing vaccine uptake for a given age group and find that increasing vaccinations in the elderly is most effective at preventing severe cases, whereas additional vaccinations for middle-aged groups reduce infections most effectively. Due to its modular structure, our model can easily be adapted to study future pandemics. We demonstrate this flexibility by investigating vaccine allocation strategies for a pandemic with characteristics of the Spanish Flu. Our approach thus helps evaluate vaccination strategies under the complex interplay of core epidemic factors, including age-dependent risk profiles, immunity waning, vaccine availability and spreading rates.

Due to the quadratic time and space complexity of self-attention, they usually operate at the level of relatively short (e.g., utterance) segments. In this paper, we study the use of context, i.e., surrounding segments, during fine-tuning and propose a new approach called context-aware fine-tuning. We attach a context module on top of the last layer of a pre-trained model to encode the whole segment into a context embedding vector which is then used as an additional feature for the final prediction. During the fine-tuning stage, we introduce an auxiliary loss that encourages this context embedding vector to be similar to context vectors of surrounding segments. This allows the model to make predictions without access to these surrounding segments at inference time and requires only a tiny overhead compared to standard fine-tuned models. We evaluate the proposed approach using the SLUE and Librilight benchmarks for several downstream tasks: Automatic speech recognition (ASR), named entity recognition (NER), and sentiment analysis (SA). The results show that context-aware fine-tuning not only outperforms a standard fine-tuning baseline but also rivals a strong context injection baseline that uses neighboring speech segments during inference.

However, due to the low sensitivity of seismic imaging to CO2 concentration, additional developments are required to efficiently interpret the seismic images for leakage. In this work, we introduce a binary classification of time-lapse seismic images to delineate CO2 plumes (leakage) using state-of-the-art deep learning models. Additionally, we localize the leakage region of CO2 plumes by leveraging Class Activation Mapping methods. ",

    "title": "Computing Well-Covered Vector Spaces of Graphs using Modular  Decomposition",
    "abstract": "A graph is well-covered if all its maximal independent sets have the same cardinality. This well studied concept was introduced by Plummer in 1970 and naturally generalizes to the weighted case. Given a graph $G$, a real-valued vertex weight function $w$ is said to be a well-covered weighting of $G$ if all its maximal independent sets are of the same weight. The set of all well-covered weightings of a graph $G$ forms a vector space over the field of real numbers, called the well-covered vector space of $G$. Since the problem of recognizing well-covered graphs is $\\mathsf{co}$-$\\mathsf{NP}$-complete, the problem of computing the well-covered vector space of a given graph is $\\mathsf{co}$-$\\mathsf{NP}$-hard. Levit and Tankus showed in 2015 that the problem admits a polynomial-time algorithm in the class of claw-free graph. In this paper, we give two general reductions for the problem, one based on anti-neighborhoods and one based on modular decomposition, combined with Gaussian elimination. Building on these results, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the well-covered vector space of a given fork-free graph, generalizing the result of Levit and Tankus. Our approach implies that well-covered fork-free graphs can be recognized in polynomial time and also generalizes some known results on cographs. ",
