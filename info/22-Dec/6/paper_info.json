However, their use remains a significant challenge when dealing with real-world complex examples. In this work, we demonstrate three types of neural network architectures for efficient learning of highly non-linear deformations of solid bodies. The first two architectures are based on the recently proposed CNN U-NET and MAgNET (graph U-NET) frameworks which have shown promising performance for learning on mesh-based data. The third architecture is Perceiver IO, a very recent architecture that belongs to the family of attention-based neural networks--a class that has revolutionised diverse engineering fields and is still unexplored in computational mechanics. We study and compare the performance of all three networks on two benchmark examples, and show their capabilities to accurately predict the non-linear mechanical responses of soft bodies. ",

    "abstract": "Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a new and challenging computer vision task that bridges the gap between classic object detection (OD) benchmarks and object detection in the real world. In addition to detecting and classifying seen/labeled objects, OWOD algorithms are expected to detect novel/unknown objects - which can be classified and incrementally learned. In standard OD, object proposals not overlapping with a labeled object are automatically classified as background. Therefore, simply applying OD methods to OWOD fails as unknown objects would be predicted as background. The challenge of detecting unknown objects stems from the lack of supervision in distinguishing unknown objects and background object proposals. Previous OWOD methods have attempted to overcome this issue by generating supervision using pseudo-labeling - however, unknown object detection has remained low. Probabilistic/generative models may provide a solution for this challenge. Herein, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework for objectness estimation, where we alternate between probability distribution estimation and objectness likelihood maximization of known objects in the embedded feature space - ultimately allowing us to estimate the objectness probability of different proposals. The resulting Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector, PROB, integrates our framework into traditional object detection models, adapting them for the open-world setting. Comprehensive experiments on OWOD benchmarks show that PROB outperforms all existing OWOD methods in both unknown object detection ($\\sim 2\\times$ unknown recall) and known object detection ($\\sim 10\\%$ mAP).

We seek a learned dictionary of pedestrian behavior to obtain a semantic description of pedestrian trajectories. Supervised methods for dictionary learning are impractical since pedestrian behaviors may be unknown a priori and the process of manually generating behavior labels is prohibitively time consuming. We instead utilize a novel, unsupervised framework to create a taxonomy of pedestrian behavior observed in a specific space. First, we learn a trajectory latent space that enables unsupervised clustering to create an interpretable pedestrian behavior dictionary. We show the utility of this dictionary for building pedestrian behavior maps to visualize space usage patterns and for computing the distributions of behaviors. We demonstrate a simple but effective trajectory prediction by conditioning on these behavior labels. While many trajectory analysis methods rely on RNNs or transformers, we develop a lightweight, low-parameter approach and show results comparable to SOTA on the ETH and UCY datasets. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel method SMARTQUERY, a framework to learn a graph neural network with very few labeled nodes using a hybrid uncertainty reduction function.

In contrast to prior works that concatenate unimodal representations or use only cross-attention, we compose multimodal representations via channel fusion. By fusing on the channels, the model is able to more effectively align the tokens compared to standard methods. These multimodal representations, which we call compound tokens are generated with cross-attention transformer layers. First, vision tokens are used as queries to retrieve compatible text tokens through cross-attention. We then chain the vision tokens and the queried text tokens along the channel dimension. We call the resulting representations compound tokens. A second group of compound tokens are generated using an analogous process where the text tokens serve as queries to the cross-attention layer. We concatenate all the compound tokens for further processing with multimodal encoder. We demonstrate the effectiveness of compound tokens using an encoder-decoder vision-language model trained end-to-end in the open-vocabulary setting.

We sought to perform topic modeling to identify robust topics of discussion within a large cohort of social work notes. We retrieved a diverse, deidentified corpus of 0.95 million clinical social work notes from 181,644 patients at the University of California, San Francisco. We used word frequency analysis and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling analysis to characterize this corpus and identify potential topics of discussion. Word frequency analysis identified both medical and non-medical terms associated with specific ICD10 chapters. The LDA topic modeling analysis extracted 11 topics related to social determinants of health risk factors including financial status, abuse history, social support, risk of death, and mental health. In addition, the topic modeling approach captured the variation between different types of social work notes and across patients with different types of diseases or conditions.

In this research we pose a new challenge for neural network (or other) scene understanding algorithms - can they distinguish between plausible and implausible scenes? Plausibility can be defined both in terms of physical properties and in terms of functional and typical arrangements. Hence, we define plausibility as the probability of encountering a given scene in the real physical world.

Therefore, this paper addresses the conditions for estimating sensitivities of voltage magnitudes with respect to complex (active and reactive) electric power injections based on sensor measurements. These sensitivities represent submatrices of the inverse power flow Jacobian. We extend previous results to show that the sensitivities of a bus voltage magnitude with respect to active power injections are unique and different from those with respect to reactive power. The classical Newton-Raphson power flow model is used to derive a novel representation of bus voltage magnitudes as an underdetermined linear operator of the active and reactive power injections; parameterized by the bus power factors. Two conditions that ensure the existence of unique complex power injections given voltage magnitudes are established for this underdetermined linear system, thereby compressing the solution space. The first is a sufficient condition based on the bus power factors. The second is a necessary and sufficient condition based on the system eigenvalues. We use matrix completion theory to develop estimation methods for recovering sensitivity matrices with varying levels of sensor availability. Simulations verify the results and demonstrate engineering use of the proposed methods. ",

To address this situation, we propose an approach that can automatically detect code element references that survive in the documentation after all source code instances have been deleted. In this work, we analysed over 3,000 GitHub projects and found that most projects contain at least one outdated code element reference at some point in their history. We submitted GitHub issues to real-world projects containing outdated references detected by our approach, some of which have already led to documentation fixes.

Specifically, we design a learn-to-connect approach that adopts a dynamic multi-hop structure instead of a deterministic structure, and combine it with a DGCN module to automatically learn the connections between posts.

To make an accurate reconstruction on partially observed traffic data, we assert the importance of characterizing both global and local trends in traffic time series.

In this study, we first introduce a Laplacian kernel to temporal regularization for characterizing local trends in traffic time series, which can be formulated in the form of circular convolution. Then, we develop a low-rank Laplacian convolutional representation (LCR) model by putting the nuclear norm of a circulant matrix and the Laplacian temporal regularization together, which is proved to meet a unified framework that takes a fast Fourier transform solution in a relatively low time complexity. Through extensive experiments on some traffic datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of LCR for imputing traffic time series of various time series behaviors (e.g., data noises and strong/weak periodicity). The proposed LCR model is an efficient and effective solution to large-scale traffic data imputation over the existing baseline models.

    "abstract": "Monocular depth estimation is a challenging problem on which deep neural networks have demonstrated great potential. However, depth maps predicted by existing deep models usually lack fine-grained details due to the convolution operations and the down-samplings in networks. We find that increasing input resolution is helpful to preserve more local details while the estimation at low resolution is more accurate globally. Therefore, we propose a novel depth map fusion module to combine the advantages of estimations with multi-resolution inputs. Instead of merging the low- and high-resolution estimations equally, we adopt the core idea of Poisson fusion, trying to implant the gradient domain of high-resolution depth into the low-resolution depth. While classic Poisson fusion requires a fusion mask as supervision, we propose a self-supervised framework based on guided image filtering. We demonstrate that this gradient-based composition performs much better at noisy immunity, compared with the state-of-the-art depth map fusion method. Our lightweight depth fusion is one-shot and runs in real-time, making our method 80X faster than a state-of-the-art depth fusion method. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method can be integrated into many fully convolutional monocular depth estimation backbones with a significant performance boost, leading to state-of-the-art results of detail enhancement on depth maps.

A mismatch coping strategy that can use any $L_{p}$ scalarization, even when facing MOPs with non-convex Pareto fronts, is of great significance for MOEA/D. This paper uses the global replacement (GR) as the backbone. We analyze how GR can no longer avoid mismatches when $L_{\\infty}$ is replaced by another $L_{p}$ with $p\\in [1,\\infty)$, and find that the $L_p$-based ($1\\leq p<\\infty$) subproblems having inconsistently large preference regions. When $p$ is set to a small value, some middle subproblems have very small preference regions so that their direction vectors cannot pass through their corresponding preference regions. Therefore, we propose a generalized $L_p$ (G$L_p$) scalarization to ensure that the subproblem's direction vector passes through its preference region. Our theoretical analysis shows that GR can always avoid mismatches when using the G$L_p$ scalarization for any $p\\geq 1$.

Scientists carefully choose the scales for their experiments to extract the variables that describe the causalities in the system. They found that the coarse scale(macro) is sometimes more causal and informative than the numerous-parameter observations(micro). The phenomenon that the causality emerges by coarse-graining is called Causal Emergence(CE). Based on information theory, a number of recent works quantitatively showed that CE indeed happens while coarse-graining a micro model to the macro. However, the existing works have not discussed the question of why and when the CE happens. We quantitatively analyze the redistribution of uncertainties for coarse-graining and suggest that the redistribution of uncertainties is the cause of causal emergence. We further analyze the thresholds that determine if CE happens or not. From the regularity of the transition probability matrix(TPM) of discrete systems, the mathematical expressions of the model properties are derived. The values of thresholds for different operations are computed. The results provide the critical and specific conditions of CE as helpful suggestions for choosing the proper coarse-graining operation. The results also provided a new way to better understand the nature of causality and causal emergence. ",

However, the effectiveness of MEMs in the presence of distribution shifts remains largely unexplored. Our work examines how distribution shifts generated by common image corruptions affect the accuracy/efficiency of MEMs. We find that under common corruptions, early-exiting at the first correct exit reduces the inference cost and provides a significant boost in accuracy ( 10%) over exiting at the last layer. However, with realistic early-exit strategies, which do not assume knowledge about the correct exits, MEMs still reduce inference cost but provide a marginal improvement in accuracy (1%) compared to exiting at the last layer. Moreover, the presence of distribution shift widens the gap between an MEM's maximum classification accuracy and realistic early-exit strategies by 5% on average compared with the gap on in-distribution data. Our empirical analysis shows that the lack of calibration due to a distribution shift increases the susceptibility of such early-exit strategies to exit early and increases misclassification rates. Furthermore, the lack of calibration increases the inconsistency in the predictions of the model across exits, leading to both inefficient inference and more misclassifications compared with evaluation on in-distribution data. Finally, we propose two metrics, underthinking and overthinking, that quantify the different behavior of practical early-exit strategy under distribution shifts, and provide insights into improving the practical utility of MEMs. ",

    "abstract": "Multi-layer complex networks (MLCN) appears in various domains, such as, transportation, supply chains, etc. Failures in MLCN can lead to major disruptions in systems. Several research have focussed on different kinds of failures, such as, cascades, their reasons and ways to avoid them. This paper considers failures in a specific type of MLCN where the lower layer provides services to the higher layer without cross layer interaction, typical of a computer network. A three layer MLCN is constructed with the same set of nodes where each layer has different characteristics, the bottom most layer is Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graph with shortest path hop count among the nodes as gaussian, the middle layer is ER graph with higher number of edges from the previous, and the top most layer is scale free graph with even higher number of edges. Both edge and node failures are considered. Failures happen with decreasing order of centralities of edges and nodes in static batch mode and when the centralities change dynamically with progressive failures. Emergent pattern of three key parameters, namely, average shortest path length (ASPL), total shortest path count (TSPC) and total number of edges (TNE) for all the three layers after node or edge failures are studied. Extensive simulations show that all but one parameters show definite degrading patterns. Surprising, ASPL for the middle layer starts showing a chaotic behavior beyond a certain point for all types of failures. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks still struggle on long-tailed image datasets, and one of the reasons is that the imbalance of training data across categories leads to the imbalance of trained model parameters. Motivated by the empirical findings that trained classifiers yield larger weight norms in head classes, we propose to reformulate the recognition probabilities through included angles without re-balancing the classifier weights. Specifically, we calculate the angles between the data feature and the class-wise classifier weights to obtain angle-based prediction results. Inspired by the performance improvement of the predictive form reformulation and the outstanding performance of the widely used two-stage learning framework, we explore the different properties of this angular prediction and propose novel modules to improve the performance of different components in the framework. Our method is able to obtain the best performance among peer methods without pretraining on CIFAR10/100-LT and ImageNet-LT. Source code will be made publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "Although existing multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms have obtained competitive performance on various benchmarks, almost all of them train and validate models on the same domain. The domain generalization problem of MOT is hardly studied. To bridge this gap, we first draw the observation that the high-level information contained in natural language is domain invariant to different tracking domains. Based on this observation, we propose to introduce natural language representation into visual MOT models for boosting the domain generalization ability. However, it is infeasible to label every tracking target with a textual description. To tackle this problem, we design two modules, namely visual context prompting (VCP) and visual-language mixing (VLM). Specifically, VCP generates visual prompts based on the input frames. VLM joints the information in the generated visual prompts and the textual prompts from a pre-defined Trackbook to obtain instance-level pseudo textual description, which is domain invariant to different tracking scenes. Through training models on MOT17 and validating them on MOT20, we observe that the pseudo textual descriptions generated by our proposed modules improve the generalization performance of query-based trackers by large margins.

Most recent works infer each entity type independently, ignoring the correlations between types, e.g., when an entity is inferred as a president, it should also be a politician and a leader. To this end, we use an undirected graphical model called pairwise conditional random field (PCRF) to formulate the UFET problem, in which the type variables are not only unarily influenced by the input but also pairwisely relate to all the other type variables. We use various modern backbones for entity typing to compute unary potentials, and derive pairwise potentials from type phrase representations that both capture prior semantic information and facilitate accelerated inference. We use mean-field variational inference for efficient type inference on very large type sets and unfold it as a neural network module to enable end-to-end training. Experiments on UFET show that the Neural-PCRF consistently outperforms its backbones with little cost and results in a competitive performance against cross-encoder based SOTA while being thousands of times faster. We also find Neural- PCRF effective on a widely used fine-grained entity typing dataset with a smaller type set. We pack Neural-PCRF as a network module that can be plugged onto multi-label type classifiers with ease and release it in https://github.com/modelscope/adaseq/tree/master/examples/NPCRF. ",

Quality of service (QoS) describes the performance of a web service dynamically with respect to the service requested by the service consumer. Moreover, the latent factorization of tenors (LFT) is very effective for discovering temporal patterns in high dimensional and sparse (HiDS) tensors. However, current LFT models suffer from a low convergence rate and rarely account for the effects of outliers. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based Outlier-Resilient Nonnegative Latent-factorization of Tensors model. We maintain the non-negativity of the model by constructing an augmented Lagrangian function with the ADMM optimization framework. In addition, the Cauchy function is taken as the metric function to reduce the impact on the model training. The empirical work on two dynamic QoS datasets shows that the proposed method has faster convergence and better performance on prediction accuracy. ",

However, this paradigm has not achieved comparable results with other self-supervised approach in computer vision (e.g., contrastive learning, mask image modeling). In this paper, we try to find the reason why autoregressive modeling does not work well on vision tasks. To tackle this problem, we fully analyze the limitation of visual autoregressive methods and proposed a novel stochastic autoregressive image modeling (named SAIM) by the two simple designs. First, we employ stochastic permutation strategy to generate effective and robust image context which is critical for vision tasks. Second, we create a parallel encoder-decoder training process in which the encoder serves a similar role to the standard vision transformer focus on learning the whole contextual information, and meanwhile the decoder predicts the content of the current position, so that the encoder and decoder can reinforce each other. By introducing stochastic prediction and the parallel encoder-decoder, SAIM significantly improve the performance of autoregressive image modeling. Our method achieves the best accuracy (83.9%) on the vanilla ViT-Base model among methods using only ImageNet-1K data.

Although significant progress has been made, the factual inconsistency between the document and the generated summary still limits its practical applications. Previous work found that the probabilities assigned by the generation model reflect its preferences for the generated summary, including the preference for factual consistency, and the preference for the language or knowledge prior as well. To separate the preference for factual consistency, we propose an unsupervised framework named CoP by controlling the preference of the generation model with the help of prompt. More specifically, the framework performs an extra inference step in which a text prompt is introduced as an additional input. In this way, another preference is described by the generation probability of this extra inference process. The difference between the above two preferences, i.e. the difference between the probabilities, could be used as measurements for detecting factual inconsistencies. Interestingly, we found that with the properly designed prompt, our framework could evaluate specific preferences and serve as measurements for fine-grained categories of inconsistency, such as entity-related inconsistency, coreference-related inconsistency, etc. Moreover, our framework could also be extended to the supervised setting to learn better prompt from the labeled data as well. Experiments show that our framework achieves new SOTA results on three factual inconsistency detection tasks. ",

The multi-dimensional joint probability distributions are then estimated. The inverse matrix of the aggregated randomization matrix can be computed efficiently at a lightweight computation cost (i.e., linear with respect to dimensionality) and with manageable storage requirements.

Also, TST models implicitly need to preserve the content while transforming a source sentence into the target style. To tackle these problems, an intermediate representation is often constructed that is devoid of style while still preserving the meaning of the source sentence. In this work, we study the usefulness of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph as the intermediate style agnostic representation. We posit that semantic notations like AMR are a natural choice for an intermediate representation. Hence, we propose T-STAR: a model comprising of two components, text-to-AMR encoder and a AMR-to-text decoder. We propose several modeling improvements to enhance the style agnosticity of the generated AMR. To the best of our knowledge, T-STAR is the first work that uses AMR as an intermediate representation for TST. With thorough experimental evaluation we show T-STAR significantly outperforms state of the art techniques by achieving on an average 15.2% higher content preservation with negligible loss (3% approx.) in style accuracy. Through detailed human evaluation with 90,000 ratings, we also show that T-STAR has up to 50% lesser hallucinations compared to state of the art TST models. ",

Although there exist different methods to enable a 3D reconstruction of Mars' surface, they rely on classical computer graphics techniques that incur high amounts of computational resources during the reconstruction process, and have limitations with generalizing reconstructions to unseen scenes and adapting to new images coming from rover cameras. The proposed framework solves the aforementioned limitations by exploiting Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), a method that synthesize complex scenes by optimizing a continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of images. To speed up the learning process, we replaced the sparse set of rover images with their neural graphics primitives (NGPs), a set of vectors of fixed length that are learned to preserve the information of the original images in a significantly smaller size.

Recently, a new class of label based MIAs (LAB MIAs) was proposed, where an adversary was only required to have knowledge of predicted labels of samples. Developing a defense against an adversary carrying out a LAB MIA on DNN models that cannot be retrained remains an open problem. We present LDL, a light weight defense against LAB MIAs. LDL works by constructing a high-dimensional sphere around queried samples such that the model decision is unchanged for (noisy) variants of the sample within the sphere. This sphere of label-invariance creates ambiguity and prevents a querying adversary from correctly determining whether a sample is a member or a nonmember. We analytically characterize the success rate of an adversary carrying out a LAB MIA when LDL is deployed, and show that the formulation is consistent with experimental observations. We evaluate LDL on seven datasets -- CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, GTSRB, Face, Purchase, Location, and Texas -- with varying sizes of training data. All of these datasets have been used by SOTA LAB MIAs. Our experiments demonstrate that LDL reduces the success rate of an adversary carrying out a LAB MIA in each case. We empirically compare LDL with defenses against LAB MIAs that require retraining of DNN models, and show that LDL performs favorably despite not needing to retrain the DNNs. ",

    "abstract": "With the rise of AI in recent years and the increase in complexity of the models, the growing demand in computational resources is starting to pose a significant challenge. The need for higher compute power is being met with increasingly more potent accelerators and the use of large compute clusters. However, the gain in prediction accuracy from large models trained on distributed and accelerated systems comes at the price of a substantial increase in energy demand, and researchers have started questioning the environmental friendliness of such AI methods at scale. Consequently, energy efficiency plays an important role for AI model developers and infrastructure operators alike. The energy consumption of AI workloads depends on the model implementation and the utilized hardware. Therefore, accurate measurements of the power draw of AI workflows on different types of compute nodes is key to algorithmic improvements and the design of future compute clusters and hardware. To this end, we present measurements of the energy consumption of two typical applications of deep learning models on different types of compute nodes. Our results indicate that 1. deriving energy consumption directly from runtime is not accurate, but the consumption of the compute node needs to be considered regarding its composition; 2. neglecting accelerator hardware on mixed nodes results in overproportional inefficiency regarding energy consumption; 3. energy consumption of model training and inference should be considered separately - while training on GPUs outperforms all other node types regarding both runtime and energy consumption, inference on CPU nodes can be comparably efficient. One advantage of our approach is that the information on energy consumption is available to all users of the supercomputer, enabling an easy transfer to other workloads alongside a raise in user-awareness of energy consumption.

    "abstract": "We present a robust methodology for evaluating biases in natural language generation(NLG) systems. Previous works use fixed hand-crafted prefix templates with mentions of various demographic groups to prompt models to generate continuations for bias analysis. These fixed prefix templates could themselves be specific in terms of styles or linguistic structures, which may lead to unreliable fairness conclusions that are not representative of the general trends from tone varying prompts. To study this problem, we paraphrase the prompts with different syntactic structures and use these to evaluate demographic bias in NLG systems. Our results suggest similar overall bias trends but some syntactic structures lead to contradictory conclusions compared to past works. We show that our methodology is more robust and that some syntactic structures prompt more toxic content while others could prompt less biased generation. This suggests the importance of not relying on a fixed syntactic structure and using tone-invariant prompts. Introducing syntactically-diverse prompts can achieve more robust NLG (bias) evaluation.

With the rise in human interaction data and extensive use of online social networks, the structure of social networks (representing connections between individuals) can be used for measuring stratification. However, although stratification has been studied extensively in the social sciences, there is no single, generally applicable metric for measuring the level of stratification in a network. In this work, we first propose the novel Stratification Assortativity (StA) metric, which measures the extent to which a network is stratified into different tiers. Then, we use the \\texttt{StA} metric to perform an in-depth analysis of the stratification of five co-authorship networks. We examine the evolution of these networks over 50 years and show that these fields demonstrate an increasing level of stratification over time, and, correspondingly, the trajectory of a researcher's career is increasingly correlated with her entry point into the network.

    "abstract": "Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications using low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is a promising technology for providing high spectral and energy efficiency with affordable hardware cost and power consumption. However, the use of low-resolution ADCs requires special signal processing methods for channel estimation and data detection since the resulting system is severely non-linear. This paper proposes joint channel estimation and data detection methods for massive MIMO systems with low-resolution ADCs based on the variational Bayes (VB) inference framework. We first derive matched-filter quantized VB (MF-QVB) and linear minimum mean-squared error quantized VB (LMMSE-QVB) detection methods assuming the channel state information (CSI) is available. Then we extend these methods to the joint channel estimation and data detection (JED) problem and propose two methods we refer to as MF-QVB-JED and LMMSE-QVB-JED. Unlike conventional VB-based detection methods that assume knowledge of the second-order statistics of the additive noise, we propose to float the noise variance/covariance matrix as an unknown random variable that is used to account for both the noise and the residual inter-user interference. We also present practical aspects of the QVB framework to improve its implementation stability. Finally, we show via numerical results that the proposed VB-based methods provide robust performance and also significantly outperform existing methods. ",

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) communication can provide high-capacity data transmissions benefiting from the ultra-broad bandwidth, but suffers from severe propagation loss and line-of-sight (LoS) blockage that limits the network coverage. To compensate for the loss, narrow beams are required. But they in turn bring in THz narrow beam alignment challenges in mobile networks, resulting in poor link connection and severe latency that degrades the network performance. This paper exploits integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology to reduce the THz beam misalignment caused by LoS blockage and user mobility. In line with the 5G-specified beam management, we propose a joint reference signal (RS) and the synchronization signal block (SSB)-based sensing scheme to predict the need for beam switches, and signalling in advance to prevent beam misalignment, named the joint SSB and RS-based sensing (JSRS) scheme. By reducing the impact of imperfect sensing, we further provide a time-frequency sensing resource allocation scheme that minimizes the beam misalignment probability. Considering the sensing trade-offs and THz features, we provide stochastic geometry-based expressions for coverage probability and network throughput, revealing design insights into ISAC-THz network deployment and resource allocation. In urban use cases tested, numerical results show that the JSRS scheme averagely reduces 80% probability of beam misalignment, and enhances the coverage probability by about 75%, compared to the network with 5G-required positioning ability. Despite the imperfect sensing accuracy, JSRS scheme can achieve comparable performance to that of the ideal-sensing case. By exploiting the angular perception ability of directional beams, JSRS scheme helps mitigate the challenge of narrow beam management to enhance the network coverage and throughput, showing the great potential of ISAC-aided THz communication.

    "abstract": "The problem of designing downlink transmission schemes for supporting heterogeneous ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and/or with other types of services is investigated. We consider the broadcast channel, where the base station sends superimposed signals to multiple users. Under heterogeneous blocklength constraints, strong users who are URLLC users cannot wait to receive the entire transmission frame and perform successive interference cancellation (SIC) due to stringent latency requirements, in contrast to the conventional infinite blocklength cases. Even if SIC is feasible, SIC may be imperfect under finite blocklength constraints. To cope with the heterogeneity in latency and reliability requirements, we propose a practical downlink transmission scheme with discrete signaling and single-user decoding (SUD), i.e., without SIC. We carefully design the discrete input distributions to enable efficient SUD by exploiting the structural interference. Furthermore, we derive the second-order achievable rate under heterogenous blocklength and error probability constraints and use it to guide the design of channel coding and modulations. It is shown that in terms of achievable rate under short blocklength, the proposed scheme with regular quadrature amplitude modulations and SUD can operate extremely close to the benchmark schemes that assume perfect SIC with Gaussian signaling.

Previous methods using deep convolutional neural networks have boosted the performance, but their giant models lead to a deficiency in flexibility. Besides, most of them fail to take full advantage of the dataset. In this paper, we present a novel end-to-end FAP approach integrating dual label distribution and lightweight design. To make the best use of the dataset, the manual ratings, attractiveness score, and standard deviation are aggregated explicitly to construct a dual label distribution, including the attractiveness distribution and the rating distribution. Such distributions, as well as the attractiveness score, are optimized under a joint learning framework based on the label distribution learning (LDL) paradigm. As for the lightweight design, the data processing is simplified to minimum, and MobileNetV2 is selected as our backbone. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark datasets, where our approach achieves promising results and succeeds in striking a balance between performance and efficiency. Ablation studies demonstrate that our delicately designed learning modules are indispensable and correlated. Additionally, the visualization indicates that our approach is capable of perceiving facial attractiveness and capturing attractive facial regions to facilitate semantic predictions. ",

This perspective naturally relates deep learning with the pursuit of constructing channels with optimal performance in information transmission and representation. While considerable efforts are concentrated on realizing optimal channel properties during network optimization, we study a frequently overlooked possibility that neural networks can be initialized toward optimal channels. Our theory, consistent with experimental validation, identifies primary mechanics underlying this unknown possibility and suggests intrinsic connections between statistical physics and deep learning. Unlike the conventional theories that characterize neural networks applying the classic mean-filed approximation, we offer analytic proof that this extensively applied simplification scheme is not valid in studying neural networks as information channels. To fill this gap, we develop a corrected mean-field framework applicable for characterizing the limiting behaviors of information propagation in neural networks without strong assumptions on inputs. Based on it, we propose an analytic theory to prove that mutual information maximization is realized between inputs and propagated signals when neural networks are initialized at dynamic isometry, a case where information transmits via norm-preserving mappings. These theoretical predictions are validated by experiments on real neural networks, suggesting the robustness of our theory against finite-size effects. Finally, we analyze our findings with information bottleneck theory to confirm the precise relations among dynamic isometry, mutual information maximization, and optimal channel properties in deep learning.

In light of this, we seek to learn optimal graph structures for downstream tasks and propose a novel framework for semi-supervised classification. Specifically, based on the structural context information of graph and node representations, we encode the complex interactions in semantics and generate semantic graphs to preserve the global structure. Moreover, we develop a novel multi-measure attention layer to optimize the similarity rather than prescribing it a priori, so that the similarity can be adaptively evaluated by integrating measures. These graphs are fused and optimized together with GNN towards semi-supervised classification objective.

While the top-5 zero-shot accuracies of these models are very high, the top-1 accuracies are much lower (over 25% gap in some cases). We investigate the reasons for this performance gap and find that many of the failure cases are caused by ambiguity in the text prompts. First, we develop a simple and efficient zero-shot post-hoc method to identify images whose top-1 prediction is likely to be incorrect, by measuring consistency of the predictions w.r.t. multiple prompts and image transformations. We show that our procedure better predicts mistakes, outperforming the popular max logit baseline on selective prediction tasks. Next, we propose a simple and efficient way to improve accuracy on such uncertain images by making use of the WordNet hierarchy; specifically we augment the original class by incorporating its parent and children from the semantic label hierarchy, and plug the augmentation into text promts. We conduct experiments on both CLIP and LiT models with five different ImageNet-based datasets. For CLIP, our method improves the top-1 accuracy by 17.13% on the uncertain subset and 3.6% on the entire ImageNet validation set. We also show that our method improves across ImageNet shifted datasets and other model architectures such as LiT. Our proposed method is hyperparameter-free, requires no additional model training and can be easily scaled to other large multi-modal architectures. ",

Recently, to relieve the labeling burden while maintaining performance, some scribble-based SOD methods have been proposed. However, learning precise boundary details from scribble annotations that lack edge information is still difficult. In this paper, we propose to learn precise boundaries from our designed synthetic images and labels without introducing any extra auxiliary data. The synthetic image creates boundary information by inserting synthetic concave regions that simulate the real concave regions of salient objects. Furthermore, we propose a novel self-consistent framework that consists of a global integral branch (GIB) and a boundary-aware branch (BAB) to train a saliency detector. GIB aims to identify integral salient objects, whose input is the original image. BAB aims to help predict accurate boundaries, whose input is the synthetic image. These two branches are connected through a self-consistent loss to guide the saliency detector to predict precise boundaries while identifying salient objects. Experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly supervised SOD methods and further narrows the gap with the fully supervised methods. ",

However, it also means that users' private data may be collected by commercial organizations without consent and used to train their models.

In this paper, we propose ConfounderGAN, a generative adversarial network (GAN) that can make personal image data unlearnable to protect the data privacy of its owners. Specifically, the noise produced by the generator for each image has the confounder property. It can build spurious correlations between images and labels, so that the model cannot learn the correct mapping from images to labels in this noise-added dataset. Meanwhile, the discriminator is used to ensure that the generated noise is small and imperceptible, thereby remaining the normal utility of the encrypted image for humans. The experiments are conducted in six image classification datasets, consisting of three natural object datasets and three medical datasets. The results demonstrate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in standard settings, but can also be applied to fast encryption scenarios.

Given a sequence of color images, unsupervised learning methods based on the framework of Structure-From-Motion (SfM) simultaneously predict depth and camera relative pose. However, dynamically moving objects in the scene violate the static world assumption, resulting in inaccurate depths of dynamic objects. In this work, we propose a new method to address such dynamic object movements through monocular 3D object detection. Specifically, we first detect 3D objects in the images and build the per-pixel correspondence of the dynamic pixels with the detected object pose while leaving the static pixels corresponding to the rigid background to be modeled with camera motion. In this way, the depth of every pixel can be learned via a meaningful geometry model. Besides, objects are detected as cuboids with absolute scale, which is used to eliminate the scale ambiguity problem inherent in monocular vision. Experiments on the KITTI depth dataset show that our method achieves State-of-The-Art performance for depth estimation. Furthermore, joint training of depth, camera motion and object pose also improves monocular 3D object detection performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that allows a monocular 3D object detection network to be fine-tuned in a self-supervised manner. ",

The crux of this problem is to model the coupling relation between the two networks in the day-ahead scheduling stage and consider the intra-day spatial uncertainties of the source and load. Meanwhile, the flexible load with a certain adjustment margin is introduced to ensure the balance of supply and demand of power nodes and consume the renewable energy better. Furthermore, we show the interactions between the power system and EV users from a potential game-theoretic perspective, where the uncertainties are characterized by an ambiguity set. In order to ensure the individual optimality of the two networks in a unified framework in day-ahead power scheduling, a two-stage distributionally robust centralized optimization model is established to carry out the equilibrium of power-transportation coupled network. On this basis, a combination of the duality theory and the Benders decomposition is developed to solve the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach can obtain individual optimal and less conservative strategies. ",

    "abstract": "Clustering is a fundamental problem in many areas, which aims to partition a given data set into groups based on some distance measure, such that the data points in the same group are similar while that in different groups are dissimilar. Due to its importance and NP-hardness, a lot of methods have been proposed, among which evolutionary algorithms are a class of popular ones. Evolutionary clustering has found many successful applications, but all the results are empirical, lacking theoretical support. This paper fills this gap by proving that the approximation performance of the GSEMO (a simple multi-objective evolutionary algorithm) for solving the three popular formulations of clustering, i.e., $k$-center, $k$-median and $k$-means, can be theoretically guaranteed. Furthermore, we prove that evolutionary clustering can have theoretical guarantees even when considering fairness, which tries to avoid algorithmic bias, and has recently been an important research topic in machine learning.

    "abstract": "Pavement Distress Recognition (PDR) is an important step in pavement inspection and can be powered by image-based automation to expedite the process and reduce labor costs. Pavement images are often in high-resolution with a low ratio of distressed to non-distressed areas. Advanced approaches leverage these properties via dividing images into patches and explore discriminative features in the scale space. However, these approaches usually suffer from information loss during image resizing and low efficiency due to complex learning frameworks. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient method for PDR. A light network named the Kernel Inversed Pyramidal Resizing Network (KIPRN) is introduced for image resizing, and can be flexibly plugged into the image classification network as a pre-network to exploit resolution and scale information. In KIPRN, pyramidal convolution and kernel inversed convolution are specifically designed to mine discriminative information across different feature granularities and scales. The mined information is passed along to the resized images to yield an informative image pyramid to assist the image classification network for PDR. We applied our method to three well-known Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and conducted an evaluation on a large-scale pavement image dataset named CQU-BPDD. Extensive results demonstrate that KIPRN can generally improve the pavement distress recognition of these CNN models and show that the simple combination of KIPRN and EfficientNet-B3 significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art patch-based method in both performance and efficiency.

    "abstract": "Hyperbolic space is emerging as a promising learning space for representation learning, owning to its exponential growth volume. Compared with the flat Euclidean space, the curved hyperbolic space is far more ambient and embeddable, particularly for datasets with implicit tree-like architectures, such as hierarchies and power-law distributions. On the other hand, the structure of a real-world network is usually intricate, with some regions being tree-like, some being flat, and others being circular. Directly embedding heterogeneous structural networks into a homogeneous embedding space unavoidably brings inductive biases and distortions. Inspiringly, the discrete curvature can well describe the local structure of a node and its surroundings, which motivates us to investigate the information conveyed by the network topology explicitly in improving geometric learning. To this end, we explore the properties of the local discrete curvature of graph topology and the continuous global curvature of embedding space. Besides, a Hyperbolic Curvature-aware Graph Neural Network, HCGNN, is further proposed. In particular, HCGNN utilizes the discrete curvature to lead message passing of the surroundings and adaptively adjust the continuous curvature simultaneously. Extensive experiments on node classification and link prediction tasks show that the proposed method outperforms various competitive models by a large margin in both high and low hyperbolic graph data. Case studies further illustrate the efficacy of discrete curvature in finding local clusters and alleviating the distortion caused by hyperbolic geometry. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks can easily fool object recognition systems based on deep neural networks (DNNs). Although many defense methods have been proposed in recent years, most of them can still be adaptively evaded. One reason for the weak adversarial robustness may be that DNNs are only supervised by category labels and do not have part-based inductive bias like the recognition process of humans. Inspired by a well-known theory in cognitive psychology -- recognition-by-components, we propose a novel object recognition model ROCK (Recognizing Object by Components with human prior Knowledge). It first segments parts of objects from images, then scores part segmentation results with predefined human prior knowledge, and finally outputs prediction based on the scores. The first stage of ROCK corresponds to the process of decomposing objects into parts in human vision. The second stage corresponds to the decision process of the human brain. ROCK shows better robustness than classical recognition models across various attack settings. These results encourage researchers to rethink the rationality of currently widely-used DNN-based object recognition models and explore the potential of part-based models, once important but recently ignored, for improving robustness.

To mitigate its impact, recent works adopt convolutional neural networks or other variants to predict the floods. However, these methods directly force the model to reconstruct the raw pixels of water depth maps through constraining pixel-level differences, ignoring the high-level information contained in terrain features and rainfall patterns. To address this, we present a novel GAN-based framework for precise flood prediction, which incorporates hierarchical terrain spatial attention to help the model focus on spatially-salient areas of terrain features and constructs multi-scale rainfall embedding to extensively integrate rainfall pattern information into generation. To better adapt the model in various rainfall conditions, we leverage a rainfall regression loss for both the generator and the discriminator as additional supervision. Extensive evaluations on real catchment datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, which greatly surpasses the previous arts under different rainfall conditions. ",

However, modelling and understanding the generative process of graphs is challenging due to the discrete and high-dimensional nature of graphs, as well as permutation invariance to node orderings in underlying graph distributions. Current leading autoregressive models fail to capture the permutation invariance nature of graphs for the reliance on generation ordering and have high time complexity. Here, we propose a continuous-time generative diffusion process for permutation invariant graph generation to mitigate these issues. Specifically, we first construct a forward diffusion process defined by a stochastic differential equation (SDE), which smoothly converts graphs within the complex distribution to random graphs that follow a known edge probability. Solving the corresponding reverse-time SDE, graphs can be generated from newly sampled random graphs. To facilitate the reverse-time SDE, we newly design a position-enhanced graph score network, capturing the evolving structure and position information from perturbed graphs for permutation equivariant score estimation. Under the evaluation of comprehensive metrics, our proposed generative diffusion process achieves competitive performance in graph distribution learning. Experimental results also show that GraphGDP can generate high-quality graphs in only 24 function evaluations, much faster than previous autoregressive models. ",

To address this issue, we propose a novel Pair-Based Joint Encoding (PBJE) network, which generates pairs and clauses features simultaneously in a joint feature encoding manner to model the causal relationship in clauses. PBJE can balance the information flow among emotion clauses, cause clauses and pairs. From a multi-relational perspective, we construct a heterogeneous undirected graph and apply the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN) to capture the various relationship between clauses and the relationship between pairs and clauses.

First, we expanded the classification given by Freeman et al.

We discussed individual curves and a comprehensive framework for constructing parametric families. We estimated the security and assessed families of the pairing-friendly curve to discover families of curves better than BN, KSS, and BLS in terms of the required key size. We also evaluated the complexity of the optimal ate pairing that has never been discussed before, except by Barbulescu et al. [2].

Our contribution contains several major innovations. First, we propose a novel training scheme to generate arbitrary loading sequences in the sampling space confined by deformation constraints where the simulation cost of homogenizing microstructural responses per sequence is dramatically reduced via mechanistic reduced-order models. Second, we develop a new sequential learner that incorporates thermodynamics consistent physics constraints by customizing training loss function and data flow architecture. We additionally demonstrate the integration of trained surrogate within the framework of classic multiscale finite element solver. Our numerical experiments indicate that our model shows a significant accuracy improvement over pure data-driven emulator and a dramatic efficiency boost than reduced models. We believe our data-driven model provides a computationally efficient and mechanics consistent alternative for classic constitutive laws beneficial for potential high-throughput simulations that needs material homogenization of irreversible behaviors.

Recent breakthroughs in self-supervised learning (SSL) offer the ability to overcome the lack of labeled training samples by learning feature representations from unlabeled data. However, most current SSL techniques in the medical field have been designed for either 2D images or 3D volumes. In practice, this restricts the capability to fully leverage unlabeled data from numerous sources, which may include both 2D and 3D data. Additionally, the use of these pre-trained networks is constrained to downstream tasks with compatible data dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for unsupervised joint learning on 2D and 3D data modalities. Given a set of 2D images or 2D slices extracted from 3D volumes, we construct an SSL task based on a 2D contrastive clustering problem for distinct classes. The 3D volumes are exploited by computing vectored embedding at each slice and then assembling a holistic feature through deformable self-attention mechanisms in Transformer, allowing incorporating long-range dependencies between slices inside 3D volumes. These holistic features are further utilized to define a novel 3D clustering agreement-based SSL task and masking embedding prediction inspired by pre-trained language models. Experiments on downstream tasks, such as 3D brain segmentation, lung nodule detection, 3D heart structures segmentation, and abnormal chest X-ray detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of our joint 2D and 3D SSL approach.

The frequent variations in a cloud user's resource demand lead 'to the problem of excess power consumption, resource wastage, performance, and Quality-of-Service degradation. The proposed framework addresses these challenges by matching the application's predicted resource requirement with the resource capacity of VMs precisely and thereby consolidating the entire load on the minimum number of energy-efficient physical machines. The three consecutive contributions of the proposed work are: Online Multi-Resource Feed-forward Neural Network to forecast the multiple resource demands concurrently for future applications; autoscaling of VMs based on the clustering of the predicted resource requirements; allocation of the scaled VMs on the energy-efficient PMs. The integrated approach successively optimizes resource utilization, saves energy and automatically adapts to the changes in future application resource demand. The proposed framework is evaluated by using real workload traces of the benchmark Google Cluster Dataset and compared against different scenarios including energy-efficient VM placement with resource prediction only, VMP without resource prediction and autoscaling, and optimal VMP with autoscaling based on actual resource utilization. The observed results demonstrate that the proposed integrated approach achieves near-optimal performance against optimal VMP and outperforms rest of the VMPs in terms of power saving and resource utilization up to 88.5% and 21.12% respectively. In addition, the OM-FNN predictor shows better accuracy, lesser time and space complexity over a traditional single-input and single-output feed-forward neural network predictor. ",

We introduce binary-encoded labels (BEL), which generalizes the application of binary classification to regression by providing a framework for considering arbitrary multi-bit values when encoding target values. We identify desirable properties of suitable encoding and decoding functions used for the conversion between real-valued and binary-encoded labels based on theoretical and empirical study.

Addressing SDoH is the key to reducing healthcare inequalities and transforming a sick care system into a health-promoting system. To address the SDOH terminology gap and better embed relevant elements in advanced biomedical informatics, we propose an SDoH ontology (SDoHO), which represents fundamental SDoH factors and their relationships in a standardized and measurable way. The ontology formally models classes, relationships, and constraints based on multiple SDoH-related resources. Expert review and coverage evaluation, using clinical notes data and a national survey, showed satisfactory results. SDoHO could potentially play an essential role in providing a foundation for a comprehensive understanding of the associations between SDoH and health outcomes and providing a path toward health equity across populations.

Although large-scale generative language models (GLMs) can help automatically distill task knowledge, the textual outputs from GLMs are not directly utilizable in sequential decision-making. We resolve this problem by proposing a novel algorithm named GLM2FSA, which obtains high-level task knowledge, represented in a finite state automaton (FSA), from a given brief description of the task goal. GLM2FSA sends queries to a GLM for task knowledge in textual form and then builds a FSA to represent the textual knowledge. This algorithm fills the gap between text and automata-based representations, and the constructed FSA can be directly utilized in sequential decision-making. We provide examples to demonstrate how GLM2FSA constructs FSAs to represent knowledge encoded in the texts generated by the large-scale GLMs. ",

    "abstract": "Model compression and model defense for deep neural networks (DNNs) have been extensively and individually studied. Considering the co-importance of model compactness and robustness in practical applications, several prior works have explored to improve the adversarial robustness of the sparse neural networks. However, the structured sparse models obtained by the exiting works suffer severe performance degradation for both benign and robust accuracy, thereby causing a challenging dilemma between robustness and structuredness of the compact DNNs. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose CSTAR, an efficient solution that can simultaneously impose the low-rankness-based Compactness, high STructuredness and high Adversarial Robustness on the target DNN models. By formulating the low-rankness and robustness requirement within the same framework and globally determining the ranks, the compressed DNNs can simultaneously achieve high compression performance and strong adversarial robustness. Evaluations for various DNN models on different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CSTAR. Compared with the state-of-the-art robust structured pruning methods, CSTAR shows consistently better performance. For instance, when compressing ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, CSTAR can achieve up to 20.07% and 11.91% improvement for benign accuracy and robust accuracy, respectively. For compressing ResNet-18 with 16x compression ratio on Imagenet, CSTAR can obtain 8.58% benign accuracy gain and 4.27% robust accuracy gain compared to the existing robust structured pruning method.

Active learning (AL) algorithms are very helpful to obtain the most useful labels for training while keeping the total number of label queries under a certain budget. The existing Active Graph Embedding framework proposes to use centrality score, density score, and entropy score to evaluate the value of unlabeled nodes, and it has been shown to be capable of bringing some improvement to the node classification tasks of Graph Convolutional Networks. However, when evaluating the importance of unlabeled nodes, it fails to consider the influence of existing labeled nodes on the value of unlabeled nodes. In other words, given the same unlabeled node, the computed informative score is always the same and is agnostic to the labeled node set. With the aim to address this limitation, in this work, we introduce 3 dissimilarity-based information scores for active learning: feature dissimilarity score (FDS), structure dissimilarity score (SDS), and embedding dissimilarity score (EDS). We find out that those three scores are able to take the influence of the labeled set on the value of unlabeled candidates into consideration, boosting our AL performance. According to experiments, our newly proposed scores boost the classification accuracy by 2.1% on average and are capable of generalizing to different Graph Neural Network architectures. ",

For instance, when an object is seen from the front in one frame and from the back in another frame, we can provide additional pose constraints through canonical object correspondences. We first propose a neural network to predict such correspondences on a per-pixel level, which we then combine in our energy formulation with state-of-the-art keypoint matching solved with a joint Gauss-Newton optimization. In a pairwise setting, our method improves registration recall of state-of-the-art feature matching from 77% to 87% overall and from 21% to 52% in pairs with 10% or less inter-frame overlap. In registering RGB-D sequences, our method outperforms cutting-edge SLAM baselines in challenging, low frame-rate scenarios, achieving more than 35% reduction in trajectory error in multiple scenes.

The improved adaptation ability of FNT on text-only adaptation data came at the cost of lowered accuracy compared to the standard neural transducer model. We propose several methods to improve the performance of the FNT model. They are: adding CTC criterion during training, adding KL divergence loss during adaptation, using a pre-trained language model to seed the vocabulary predictor, and an efficient adaptation approach by interpolating the vocabulary predictor with the n-gram language model. A combination of these approaches results in a relative word-error-rate reduction of 9.48\\% from the standard FNT model. Furthermore, n-gram interpolation with the vocabulary predictor improves the adaptation speed hugely with satisfactory adaptation performance. ",

To mine similar relative orders in time series, this paper addresses an approximate order-preserving pattern (AOP) mining method based on (delta-gamma) distance to effectively measure the similarity, and proposes an algorithm called AOP-Miner to mine AOPs according to global and local approximation parameters. AOP-Miner adopts a pattern fusion strategy to generate candidate patterns generation and employs the screening strategy to calculate the supports of candidate patterns. Experimental results validate that AOP-Miner outperforms other competitive methods and can find more similar trends in time series. ",

Previous algorithms demonstrate an adversarially trained Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) provides improved robustness. We recognize the adversarial learning approach for approximating the multi-modal posterior distribution of a Bayesian model can lead to mode collapse; consequently, the model's achievements in robustness and performance are sub-optimal. Instead, we first propose preventing mode collapse to better approximate the multi-modal posterior distribution. Second, based on the intuition that a robust model should ignore perturbations and only consider the informative content of the input, we conceptualize and formulate an information gain objective to measure and force the information learned from both benign and adversarial training instances to be similar. Importantly. we prove and demonstrate that minimizing the information gain objective allows the adversarial risk to approach the conventional empirical risk. We believe our efforts provide a step toward a basis for a principled method of adversarially training BNNs. Our model demonstrate significantly improved robustness--up to 20%--compared with adversarial training and Adv-BNN under PGD attacks with 0.035 distortion on both CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets. ",

To alleviate the negative impact of this problem and take full advantage of the diversity of each heterogeneous model, we propose an efficient framework named HierarchyFL, which uses a small amount of public data for efficient and scalable knowledge across a variety of differently structured models. By using self-distillation and our proposed ensemble library, each hierarchical model can intelligently learn from each other on cloud servers.

Considering complicated shapes, sizes and orientations of anatomies, without lose of generality, we present the nine degrees-of-freedom (9-DoF) pose estimation solution in full 3D space using a novel single-stage, non-hierarchical forward representation. Our whole framework is executed in a steerable manner where any anatomy of interest can be directly retrieved to further boost the inference efficiency. We have validated the proposed method on three medical imaging parsing tasks of ribs, spine, and abdominal organs. For rib parsing, CT scans have been annotated at the rib instance-level for quantitative evaluation, similarly for spine vertebrae and abdominal organs. Extensive experiments on 9-DoF box detection and rib instance segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework (with the identification rate of 97.0% and the segmentation Dice score of 90.9%) in high efficiency, compared favorably against several strong baselines (e.g., CenterNet, FCOS, and nnU-Net).

To address these issues, we propose a framework called Prototypical Residual Network (PRN), which learns feature residuals of varying scales and sizes between anomalous and normal patterns to accurately reconstruct the segmentation maps of anomalous regions. PRN mainly consists of two parts: multi-scale prototypes that explicitly represent the residual features of anomalies to normal patterns; a multisize self-attention mechanism that enables variable-sized anomalous feature learning. Besides, we present a variety of anomaly generation strategies that consider both seen and unseen appearance variance to enlarge and diversify anomalies.

Recent works show the uploaded gradients can be employed to reconstruct data, i.e., gradient leakage attacks, and several defenses are designed to alleviate the risk by tweaking the gradients. However, these defenses exhibit weak resilience against threatening attacks, as the effectiveness builds upon the unrealistic assumptions that deep neural networks are simplified as linear models. In this paper, without such unrealistic assumptions, we present a novel defense, called Refiner, instead of perturbing gradients, which refines ground-truth data to craft robust data that yields sufficient utility but with the least amount of privacy information, and then the gradients of robust data are uploaded. To craft robust data, Refiner promotes the gradients of critical parameters associated with robust data to close ground-truth ones while leaving the gradients of trivial parameters to safeguard privacy. Moreover, to exploit the gradients of trivial parameters, Refiner utilizes a well-designed evaluation network to steer robust data far away from ground-truth data, thereby alleviating privacy leakage risk. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior defense effectiveness of Refiner at defending against state-of-the-art threats. ",

In order to fully reap such attractive algorithmic benefit, we further develop the corresponding customized hardware architecture to support the efficient execution of the proposed FDHT-LSTM model. With the delicate design of memory access scheme, the complicated matrix transformation can be efficiently supported by the underlying hardware without any access conflict in an on-the-fly way. Our evaluation results show that both the proposed ultra-compact FDHT-LSTM models and the corresponding hardware accelerator achieve very high performance. Compared with the state-of-the-art compressed LSTM models, FDHT-LSTM enjoys both order-of-magnitude reduction in model size and significant accuracy improvement across different video recognition datasets. Meanwhile, compared with the state-of-the-art tensor decomposed model-oriented hardware TIE, our proposed FDHT-LSTM architecture achieves better performance in throughput, area efficiency and energy efficiency, respectively on LSTM-Youtube workload. For LSTM-UCF workload, our proposed design also outperforms TIE with higher throughput, higher energy efficiency and comparable area efficiency. ",

Using the Hodge decomposition, we estimate the ``loop flow'' in the international remittance of cryptoassets during the bubble period. We found characteristic differences between those fiat currencies and cryptoassets during the bubble period. For ETH, there was a significant increase in the loop flow during the cryptoasset price peak. This might be related to money laundering or arbitrage transaction.

    "abstract": "Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have achieved great success in graph representation learning by extracting high-level features from nodes and their topology. Since GCNs generally follow a message-passing mechanism, each node aggregates information from its first-order neighbour to update its representation. As a result, the representations of nodes with edges between them should be positively correlated and thus can be considered positive samples. However, there are more non-neighbour nodes in the whole graph, which provide diverse and useful information for the representation update. Two non-adjacent nodes usually have different representations, which can be seen as negative samples. Besides the node representations, the structural information of the graph is also crucial for learning. In this paper, we used quality-diversity decomposition in determinant point processes (DPP) to obtain diverse negative samples. When defining a distribution on diverse subsets of all non-neighbouring nodes, we incorporate both graph structure information and node representations. Since the DPP sampling process requires matrix eigenvalue decomposition, we propose a new shortest-path-base method to improve computational efficiency. Finally, we incorporate the obtained negative samples into the graph convolution operation. The ideas are evaluated empirically in experiments on node classification tasks. These experiments show that the newly proposed methods not only improve the overall performance of standard representation learning but also significantly alleviate over-smoothing problems. ",

Moreover, existing 3D class-incremental detection methods are developed for the single-domain scenario, which fail when encountering domain shift caused by different datasets, varying environments, etc. In this paper, we identify the unexplored yet valuable scenario, i.e., class-incremental learning under domain shift, and propose a novel 3D domain adaptive class-incremental object detection framework, DA-CIL, in which we design a novel dual-domain copy-paste augmentation method to construct multiple augmented domains for diversifying training distributions, thereby facilitating gradual domain adaptation. Then, multi-level consistency is explored to facilitate dual-teacher knowledge distillation from different domains for domain adaptive class-incremental learning. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over baselines in the domain adaptive class-incremental learning scenario. ",

The solutions to these problems are generally based on their respective assumptions, \\ie{the static world assumption for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and the accurate ego-pose assumption for object tracking}. However, these assumptions are challenging to hold in dynamic road scenarios, where SLAM and object tracking become closely correlated. Therefore, we propose DL-SLOT, a dynamic LiDAR SLAM and object tracking method, to simultaneously address these two coupled problems. This method integrates the state estimations of both the autonomous vehicle and the stationary and dynamic objects in the environment into a unified optimization framework. First, we used object detection to identify all points belonging to potentially dynamic objects. Subsequently, a LiDAR odometry was conducted using the filtered point cloud. Simultaneously, we proposed a sliding window-based object association method that accurately associates objects according to the historical trajectories of tracked objects. The ego-states and those of the stationary and dynamic objects are integrated into the sliding window-based collaborative graph optimization. The stationary objects are subsequently restored from the potentially dynamic object set. Finally, a global pose-graph is implemented to eliminate the accumulated error. Experiments on KITTI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better accuracy than SLAM and object tracking baseline methods. This confirms that solving SLAM and object tracking simultaneously is mutually advantageous, dramatically improving the robustness and accuracy of SLAM and object tracking in dynamic road scenarios.

In this research, we propose YolOOD - a method that utilizes concepts from the object detection domain to perform OOD detection in the multi-label classification task. Object detection models have an inherent ability to distinguish between objects of interest (in-distribution) and irrelevant objects (e.g., OOD objects) on images that contain multiple objects from different categories. These abilities allow us to convert a regular object detection model into an image classifier with inherent OOD detection capabilities with just minor changes. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art OOD detection methods and demonstrate YolOOD's ability to outperform these methods on a comprehensive suite of in-distribution and OOD benchmark datasets.

Different from the existing contrastive-based solutions that typically represent an input skeleton sequence into instance-level features and perform contrast holistically, our proposed HiCo represents the input into multiple-level features and performs contrast in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, given a human skeleton sequence, we represent it into multiple feature vectors of different granularities from both temporal and spatial domains via sequence-to-sequence (S2S) encoders and unified downsampling modules. Besides, the hierarchical contrast is conducted in terms of four levels: instance level, domain level, clip level, and part level. Moreover, HiCo is orthogonal to the S2S encoder, which allows us to flexibly embrace state-of-the-art S2S encoders. Extensive experiments on four datasets, i.e., NTU-60, NTU-120, PKU-MMD I and II, show that HiCo achieves a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised skeleton-based action representation learning in two downstream tasks including action recognition and retrieval, and its learned action representation is of good transferability. Besides, we also show that our framework is effective for semi-supervised skeleton-based action recognition. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/HiCo. ",

The recording device source features include spatial information and certain temporal information. However, most recording device source identification methods based on deep learning only use spatial representation learning from recording device source features, which cannot make full use of recording device source information. Therefore, in this paper, to fully explore the spatial information and temporal information of recording device source, we propose a new method for recording device source identification based on the fusion of spatial feature information and temporal feature information by using an end-to-end framework. From a feature perspective, we designed two kinds of networks to extract recording device source spatial and temporal information. Afterward, we use the attention mechanism to adaptively assign the weight of spatial information and temporal information to obtain fusion features. From a model perspective, our model uses an end-to-end framework to learn the deep representation from spatial feature and temporal feature and train using deep and shallow loss to joint optimize our network. This method is compared with our previous work and baseline system. The results show that the proposed method is better than our previous work and baseline system under general conditions. ",

Driving experience is extremely important for driver attention prediction, a skilled driver is able to effortlessly predict oncoming danger (before it becomes salient) based on driving experience and quickly pay attention on the corresponding zones. However, the nonobjective driving experience is difficult to model, so a mechanism simulating driver experience accumulation procedure is absent in existing methods, and the existing methods usually follow the technique line of saliency prediction methods to predict driver attention. In this paper, we propose a FeedBack Loop Network (FBLNet), which attempts to model the driving experience accumulation procedure. By over-and-over iterations, FBLNet generates the incremental knowledge that carries rich historically-accumulative long-term temporal information. The incremental knowledge to our model is like the driving experience to humans. Under the guidance of the incremental knowledge, our model fuses the CNN feature and Transformer feature that are extracted from the input image to predict driver attention. Our model exhibits solid advantage over existing methods, achieving an average 10.3% performance improvement on three public datasets. ",

Face image quality assessment (FIQA) approaches aim to estimate the quality of the input samples that can help provide information on the confidence of the recognition decision and eventually lead to improved results in challenging scenarios. While much progress has been made in face image quality assessment in recent years, computing reliable quality scores for diverse facial images and FR models remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to face image quality assessment, called FaceQAN, that is based on adversarial examples and relies on the analysis of adversarial noise which can be calculated with any FR model learned by using some form of gradient descent. As such, the proposed approach is the first to link image quality to adversarial attacks. Comprehensive (cross-model as well as model-specific) experiments are conducted with four benchmark datasets, i.e., LFW, CFP-FP, XQLFW and IJB-C, four FR models, i.e., CosFace, ArcFace, CurricularFace and ElasticFace, and in comparison to seven state-of-the-art FIQA methods to demonstrate the performance of FaceQAN.

However, DFL faces two critical challenges, \\ie, system heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity introduced by edge devices. To ensure fast convergence with the existence of slow edge devices, we present an efficient DFL method, termed FedHP, which integrates adaptive control of both local updating frequency and network topology to better support the heterogeneous participants. We establish a theoretical relationship between local updating frequency and network topology regarding model training performance and obtain a convergence upper bound. Upon this, we propose an optimization algorithm, that adaptively determines local updating frequencies and constructs the network topology, so as to speed up convergence and improve the model accuracy.

However, maximization-based decoding methods (e.g., greedy/beam search) often lead to the degeneration problem, i.e., the generated text is unnatural and contains undesirable repetitions. Existing solutions to this problem either introduce randomness prone to incoherence or require a look-ahead mechanism that demands extra computational overhead. In this study, we formulate open-ended text generation from a new perspective, i.e., we view it as an exploration process within a directed graph. Thereby, we understand the phenomenon of degeneration as circular loops within the directed graph. Based on our formulation, we propose a novel decoding method -- \\textit{momentum decoding} -- which encourages the LM to \\textit{greedily} explore new nodes outside the current graph. Meanwhile, it also allows the LM to return to the existing nodes with a momentum downgraded by a pre-defined resistance function. We extensively test our approach on three benchmarks from different domains through automatic and human evaluations. The results show that momentum decoding performs comparably with the current state of the art while enjoying notably improved inference speed and computation FLOPs.

Prior works address this by either aligning client and server models or using control variates to correct client model drift. Although these methods achieve fast convergence in convex or simple non-convex problems, the performance in over-parameterized models such as deep neural networks is lacking. In this paper, we first revisit the widely used FedAvg algorithm in a deep neural network to understand how data heterogeneity influences the gradient updates across the neural network layers. We observe that while the feature extraction layers are learned efficiently by FedAvg, the substantial diversity of the final classification layers across clients impedes the performance. Motivated by this, we propose to correct model drift by variance reduction only on the final layers. We demonstrate that this significantly outperforms existing benchmarks at a similar or lower communication cost. We furthermore provide proof for the convergence rate of our algorithm. ",

Our results show that zero-shot LPE is better compared to the baselines, but it still falls short compared to current state of the art supervised approaches. Nevertheless, the results are important, since there was 1) no explicit domain-specific data used - so we show that the transfer to the legal domain is possible for general-purpose LLMs, and 2) the LLMs where directly applied without any further training or fine-tuning - which in turn saves immensely in terms of additional computational costs.

Thus, timely management of the fallen radiation source can be realized. What's more, position of radiation source braid is monitored by radiation source braid locking mechanism, gamma-ray induction module and keying switch. This idea solves the bottleneck problem of difficulty in transmitting real-time remote monitoring signal by NB-IoT technology. Single-chip microcontroller is innovatively embedded around the radiation source to monitor whether the source falls off. As a result, when part or all of the source braid are not returned to the storage location of the flaw detector, the gamma ray induction module, keying switch, and radiation source braid locking mechanism remind the operator of the dangerous situation. At the same time, NB-IoT transmission system alarms companies and regulators of safety risks. In conclusion, radiation source can be found timely when it falls off, to avoid radiation accident. Two bottlenecks related to installing GPS positioning system can be solved, that the GPS positioning system is installed on the flaw detector, and the radioactive source is still unable to be controlled, and that the GPS positioning system requires power to transmit the signal back to the regulatory platform or to the platform of the flaw detection enterprise.

In this paper, we consider a Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Physical Layer Security (PLS) system with multiple data streams including one legitimate passive RIS and one malicious passive RIS, with the former being transparent to the multi-antenna eavesdropper and the latter's presence being unknown at the legitimate multi-antenna transceivers. We first present a novel threat model for the RIS-boosted eavesdropping system and design a joint optimization framework for the eavesdropper's receive combining matrix and the reflection coefficients of the malicious RIS. Focusing next on the secrecy rate maximization problem, we present an RIS-empowered PLS scheme that jointly designs the legitimate precoding matrix and number of data streams, the Artificial Noise (AN) covariance matrix, the receive combining matrix, and the reflection coefficients of the legitimate RIS. The proposed optimization algorithms, whose convergence to at least local optimum points is proved, are based on alternating maximization, minorization-maximization, and manifold optimization, including semi-closed form expressions for the optimization variables. Our extensive simulation results for two representative system setups reveal that, in the absence of a legitimate RIS, transceiver spatial filtering and AN are incapable of offering non-zero secrecy rates, even for malicious RISs with small numbers of elements. However, when an $L$-element legitimate RIS is deployed, confidential communication can be safeguarded against eavesdropping systems possessing even more than a $5L$-element malicious RIS. ",

While several federated approximations of classical topic models do exist, no research has been carried out on their application for neural topic models. To fill this gap, we propose and analyze a federated implementation based on state-of-the-art neural topic modeling implementations, showing its benefits when there is a diversity of topics across the nodes' documents and the need to build a joint model.

To address these problems, we propose a novel feature matching method, named R2FD2, that is robust to radiation and rotation differences.Our R2FD2 is conducted in two critical contributions, consisting of a repeatable feature detector and a rotation-invariant feature descriptor. In the first stage, a repeatable feature detector called the Multi-channel Auto-correlation of the Log-Gabor is presented for feature detection, which combines the multi-channel auto-correlation strategy with the Log-Gabor wavelets to detect interest points with high repeatability and uniform distribution. In the second stage, a rotation-invariant feature descriptor is constructed, named the Rotation-invariant Maximum index map of the Log-Gabor, which consists of two components: fast assignment of dominant orientation and construction of feature representation. In the process of fast assignment of dominant orientation, a Rotation-invariant Maximum Index Map is built to address rotation deformations. Then, the proposed RMLG incorporates the rotation-invariant RMIM with the spatial configuration of DAISY to depict a more discriminative feature representation, which improves RMLGs resistance to radiation and rotation variances.

However, the efficiency and accuracy problems hinder its wide applications. To address these issues, we propose Geometry-Aware Generalized Neural Radiance Field (GARF) with a geometry-aware dynamic sampling (GADS) strategy to perform real-time novel view rendering and unsupervised depth estimation on unseen scenes without per-scene optimization. Distinct from most existing generalized NeRFs, our framework infers the unseen scenes on both pixel-scale and geometry-scale with only a few input images. More specifically, our method learns common attributes of novel-view synthesis by an encoder-decoder structure and a point-level learnable multi-view feature fusion module which helps avoid occlusion. To preserve scene characteristics in the generalized model, we introduce an unsupervised depth estimation module to derive the coarse geometry, narrow down the ray sampling interval to proximity space of the estimated surface and sample in expectation maximum position, constituting Geometry-Aware Dynamic Sampling strategy (GADS). Moreover, we introduce a Multi-level Semantic Consistency loss (MSC) to assist more informative representation learning. Extensive experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show that comparing with state-of-the-art generalized NeRF methods, GARF reduces samples by more than 25\\%, while improving rendering quality and 3D geometry estimation.

Previous methods commonly relied on the output of a network derived from the highly activated feature map. In this study, we first revealed that a norm of the feature map obtained from the other block than the last block can be a better indicator of OOD detection. Motivated by this, we propose a simple framework consisting of FeatureNorm: a norm of the feature map and NormRatio: a ratio of FeatureNorm for ID and OOD to measure the OOD detection performance of each block. In particular, to select the block that provides the largest difference between FeatureNorm of ID and FeatureNorm of OOD, we create Jigsaw puzzle images as pseudo OOD from ID training samples and calculate NormRatio, and the block with the largest value is selected. After the suitable block is selected, OOD detection with the FeatureNorm outperforms other OOD detection methods by reducing FPR95 by up to 52.77% on CIFAR10 benchmark and by up to 48.53% on ImageNet benchmark. We demonstrate that our framework can generalize to various architectures and the importance of block selection, which can improve previous OOD detection methods as well. ",

    "abstract": "A new Lossy Causal Temporal Convolutional Neural Network Autoencoder for anomaly detection is proposed in this work. Our framework uses a rate-distortion loss and an entropy bottleneck to learn a compressed latent representation for the task. The main idea of using a rate-distortion loss is to introduce representation flexibility that ignores or becomes robust to unlikely events with distinctive patterns, such as anomalies. These anomalies manifest as unique distortion features that can be accurately detected in testing conditions. This new architecture allows us to train a fully unsupervised model that has high accuracy in detecting anomalies from a distortion score despite being trained with some portion of unlabelled anomalous data. This setting is in stark contrast to many of the state-of-the-art unsupervised methodologies that require the model to be only trained on \"normal data\". We argue that this partially violates the concept of unsupervised training for anomaly detection as the model uses an informed decision that selects what is normal from abnormal for training. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest it also effects the models ability at generalisation. We demonstrate that models that succeed in the paradigm where they are only trained on normal data fail to be robust when anomalous data is injected into the training. In contrast, our compression-based approach converges to a robust representation that tolerates some anomalous distortion. The robust representation achieved by a model using a rate-distortion loss can be used in a more realistic unsupervised anomaly detection scheme. ",

The current work proposed to expand the state-of-art of smart healthcare in integrating solutions for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Identification of OCD from oxidative stress biomarkers (OSBs) using machine learning is an important development in the study of OCD. However, this process involves the collection of OCD class labels from hospitals, collection of corresponding OSBs from biochemical laboratories, integrated and labeled dataset creation, use of suitable machine learning algorithm for designing OCD prediction model, and making these prediction models available for different biochemical laboratories for OCD prediction for unlabeled OSBs. Further, from time to time, with significant growth in the volume of the dataset with labeled samples, redesigning the prediction model is required for further use. The whole process requires distributed data collection, data integration, coordination between the hospital and biochemical laboratory, dynamic machine learning OCD prediction mode design using a suitable machine learning algorithm, and making the machine learning model available for the biochemical laboratories. Keeping all these things in mind, Accu-Help a fully automated, smart, and accurate OCD detection conceptual model is proposed to help the biochemical laboratories for efficient detection of OCD from OSBs.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully applied in many applications in computer sciences. Despite the success of deep learning architectures in other domains, deep GNNs still underperform their shallow counterparts. There are many open questions about deep GNNs, but over-smoothing and over-squashing are perhaps the most intriguing issues. When stacking multiple graph convolutional layers, the over-smoothing and over-squashing problems arise and have been defined as the inability of GNNs to learn deep representations and propagate information from distant nodes, respectively. Even though the widespread definitions of both problems are similar, these phenomena have been studied independently. This work strives to understand the underlying relationship between over-smoothing and over-squashing from a topological perspective. We show that both problems are intrinsically related to the spectral gap of the Laplacian of the graph. Therefore, there is a trade-off between these two problems, i.e., we cannot simultaneously alleviate both over-smoothing and over-squashing. We also propose a Stochastic Jost and Liu curvature Rewiring (SJLR) algorithm based on a bound of the Ollivier's Ricci curvature. SJLR is less expensive than previous curvature-based rewiring methods while retaining fundamental properties. Finally, we perform a thorough comparison of SJLR with previous techniques to alleviate over-smoothing or over-squashing, seeking to gain a better understanding of both problems. ",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in the internet and technology have made major advancements in tools that facilitate the collection of social data, opening up thus new opportunities for analyzing social networks. Social network analysis studies the patterns of social relations and aims at discovering the hidden features embedded in the structure of social networks. One of the most important features in social networks is community structure : densely knit groups of individuals. The dynamic nature of interaction in social networks often challenges the detection of such community structures. The contributions in this thesis fall into two categories.The first category highlights the problem of identifying overlapping communities over time. To carry out such analysis, a framework called OLCPM (Online Label propagation and Clique Percolation Method) is proposed. It is an online algorithm based on clique percolation and label propagation methods. OLCPM has two main features : the first one is its ability to discover overlapping communities, while the second is its effectiveness in handling fine-grained temporal net works. As for as the second category is concerned, it emphasizes on the problem of analyzing communities that are embedded at different temporal scales. For example, in networks of interaction such as e-mails or phone calls, individuals are involved in daily as well as occasional conversations. We propose a first method for analyzing communities at multiple temporal scales. Hence, the dynamic network (link streams) is studied at different temporal granularities, and coherent communities (called stable communities) over a period of time are detected at each temporal granularity. The two proposed approaches are validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Power grids, across the world, play an important societal and economical role by providing uninterrupted, reliable and transient-free power to several industries, businesses and household consumers. With the advent of renewable power resources and EVs resulting into uncertain generation and highly dynamic load demands, it has become ever so important to ensure robust operation of power networks through suitable management of transient stability issues and localize the events of blackouts. In the light of ever increasing stress on the modern grid infrastructure and the grid operators, this paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, PowRL, to mitigate the effects of unexpected network events, as well as reliably maintain electricity everywhere on the network at all times. The PowRL leverages a novel heuristic for overload management, along with the RL-guided decision making on optimal topology selection to ensure that the grid is operated safely and reliably (with no overloads). PowRL is benchmarked on a variety of competition datasets hosted by the L2RPN (Learning to Run a Power Network). Even with its reduced action space, PowRL tops the leaderboard in the L2RPN NeurIPS 2020 challenge (Robustness track) at an aggregate level, while also being the top performing agent in the L2RPN WCCI 2020 challenge. Moreover, detailed analysis depicts state-of-the-art performances by the PowRL agent in some of the test scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Pixel-level labels are particularly expensive to acquire. Hence, pretraining is a critical step to improve models on a task like semantic segmentation. However, prominent algorithms for pretraining neural networks use image-level objectives, e.g. image classification, image-text alignment a la CLIP, or self-supervised contrastive learning. These objectives do not model spatial information, which might be suboptimal when finetuning on downstream tasks with spatial reasoning. In this work, we propose to pretrain networks for semantic segmentation by predicting the relative location of image parts. We formulate this task as a classification problem where each patch in a query view has to predict its position relatively to another reference view. We control the difficulty of the task by masking a subset of the reference patch features visible to those of the query. Our experiments show that this location-aware (LOCA) self-supervised pretraining leads to representations that transfer competitively to several challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks. ",

The conditions for granting access in such a system are collected in access policies. Since access conditions are often complex, dedicated languages -- policy languages -- for defining policies are in use.

With privacy-preserving technologies, users are enabled to prove information to the access system without revealing it. In this work, we present a generic design for supporting privacy-preserving technologies in policy languages. Our design prevents unnecessary disclosure of sensitive information while still allowing the formulation of expressive rules for access control. For that we make use of zero-knowledge proofs (NIZKs). We demonstrate our design by applying it to the TPL policy language, while using SNARKs. Also, we evaluate the resulting ZK-TPL language and its associated toolchain. Our evaluation shows that for regular-sized credentials communication and verification overhead is negligible. ",

    "abstract": "Optimal Transport (OT) provides a useful geometric framework to estimate the permutation matrix under unsupervised cross-lingual word embedding (CLWE) models that pose the alignment task as a Wasserstein-Procrustes problem. However, linear programming algorithms and approximate OT solvers via Sinkhorn for computing the permutation matrix come with a significant computational burden since they scale cubically and quadratically, respectively, in the input size. This makes it slow and infeasible to compute OT distances exactly for a larger input size, resulting in a poor approximation quality of the permutation matrix and subsequently a less robust learned transfer function or mapper. This paper proposes an unsupervised projection-based CLWE model called quantized Wasserstein Procrustes (qWP). qWP relies on a quantization step of both the source and target monolingual embedding space to estimate the permutation matrix given a cheap sampling procedure. This approach substantially improves the approximation quality of empirical OT solvers given fixed computational cost. We demonstrate that qWP achieves state-of-the-art results on the Bilingual lexicon Induction (BLI) task. ",

CaFi-Net directly learns from continuous and noisy radiance fields using a Siamese network architecture that is designed to extract equivariant field features for category-level canonicalization.

It is especially critical for emerging and/or orphan diseases due to its cheaper investment and shorter research cycle compared with traditional wet-lab drug discovery approaches. However, the underlying mechanisms of action between repurposed drugs and their target diseases remain largely unknown, which is still an unsolved issue in existing repurposing methods. As such, computational drug repurposing has not been widely adopted in clinical settings. In this work, based on a massive biomedical knowledge graph, we propose a computational drug repurposing framework that not only predicts the treatment probabilities between drugs and diseases but also predicts the path-based, testable mechanisms of action (MOAs) as their biomedical explanations. Specifically, we utilize the GraphSAGE model in an unsupervised manner to integrate each entity's neighborhood information and employ a Random Forest model to predict the treatment probabilities between pairs of drugs and diseases. Moreover, we train an adversarial actor-critic reinforcement learning model to predict the potential MOA for explaining drug purposing. To encourage the model to find biologically reasonable paths, we utilize the curated molecular interactions of drugs and a PubMed-publication-based concept distance to extract potential drug MOA paths from the knowledge graph as \"demonstration paths\" to guide the model during the process of path-finding. Comprehensive experiments and case studies show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both predictive performance of drug repurposing and explanatory performance of recapitulating human-curated DrugMechDB-based paths.

We propose a simple approach in which the distribution of uncertain parameters is approximated using a parametric family of distributions. This mitigates both sources of complexity; however, it introduces a model misspecification error. We show that this new source of error can be controlled by suitable DRO formulations. Our proposed parametric DRO approach has significantly improved generalization bounds over existing ERM / DRO methods and parametric ERM for a wide variety of settings.

    "abstract": "Quantifying the perceptual similarity of two images is a long-standing problem in low-level computer vision. The natural image domain commonly relies on supervised learning, e.g., a pre-trained VGG, to obtain a latent representation. However, due to domain shift, pre-trained models from the natural image domain might not apply to other image domains, such as medical imaging. Notably, in medical imaging, evaluating the perceptual similarity is exclusively performed by specialists trained extensively in diverse medical fields. Thus, medical imaging remains devoid of task-specific, objective perceptual measures. This work answers the question: Is it necessary to rely on supervised learning to obtain an effective representation that could measure perceptual similarity, or is self-supervision sufficient? To understand whether recent contrastive self-supervised representation (CSR) may come to the rescue, we start with natural images and systematically evaluate CSR as a metric across numerous contemporary architectures and tasks and compare them with existing methods. We find that in the natural image domain, CSR behaves on par with the supervised one on several perceptual tests as a metric, and in the medical domain, CSR better quantifies perceptual similarity concerning the experts' ratings. We also demonstrate that CSR can significantly improve image quality in two image synthesis tasks. Finally, our extensive results suggest that perceptuality is an emergent property of CSR, which can be adapted to many image domains without requiring annotations. ",

Most of the prior work and proposals assume an on-demand distribution of entanglements which may result in significant network resource under-utilization. In this work, we introduce Quantum Overlay Networks (QONs) for efficient entanglement distribution in quantum networks. When the demand to create end-to-end user entanglements is low, QONs can generate and store maximally entangled Bell pairs (EPR pairs) at specific overlay storage nodes of the network. Later, during peak demands, requests can be served by performing entanglement swaps either over a direct path from the network or over a path using the storage nodes. We solve the link entanglement and storage resource allocation problem in such a QON using a centralized optimization framework. We evaluate the performance of our proposed QON architecture over a wide number of network topologies under various settings using extensive simulation experiments. Our results demonstrate that QONs fare well by a factor of 40% with respect to meeting surge and changing demands compared to traditional non-overlay proposals. QONs also show significant improvement in terms of average entanglement request service delay over non-overlay approaches. ",

By exploiting the quasi-experimental setting induced by the first Western COVID-19 lockdown - the unexpected lockdown implemented in Northern Italy in February 2020 - we measure changes in public uncertainty and sentiment expressed on daily pre and post-lockdown tweets geolocalized inside and in the proximity of the lockdown areas. Using natural language processing, including dictionary-based methods and deep learning models, we classify each tweet across four categories - economics, health, politics and lockdown policy - to identify in which areas uncertainty and sentiments concentrate. Using a Difference-in-Difference analysis, we show that areas under lockdown depict lower uncertainty around the economy and the stay-at-home mandate itself. This surprising result likely stems from an informational asymmetry channel, for which treated individuals adjusts their expectations once the policy is in place, while uncertainty persists around the untreated.

    "abstract": "Air pollution is an emerging problem that needs to be solved especially in developed and developing countries. In Vietnam, air pollution is also a concerning issue in big cities such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh cities where air pollution comes mostly from vehicles such as cars and motorbikes. In order to tackle the problem, the paper focuses on developing a solution that can estimate the emitted PM2.5 pollutants by counting the number of vehicles in the traffic. We first investigated among the recent object detection models and developed our own traffic surveillance system. The observed traffic density showed a similar trend to the measured PM2.5 with a certain lagging in time, suggesting a relation between traffic density and PM2.5. We further express this relationship with a mathematical model which can estimate the PM2.5 value based on the observed traffic density. The estimated result showed a great correlation with the measured PM2.5 plots in the urban area context. ",

    "abstract": "Graph learning problems are typically approached by focusing on learning the topology of a single graph when signals from all nodes are available. However, many contemporary setups involve multiple related networks and, moreover, it is often the case that only a subset of nodes is observed while the rest remain hidden. Motivated by this, we propose a joint graph learning method that takes into account the presence of hidden (latent) variables. Intuitively, the presence of the hidden nodes renders the inference task ill-posed and challenging to solve, so we overcome this detrimental influence by harnessing the similarity of the estimated graphs. To that end, we assume that the observed signals are drawn from a Gaussian Markov random field with latent variables and we carefully model the graph similarity among hidden (latent) nodes. Then, we exploit the structure resulting from the previous considerations to propose a convex optimization problem that solves the joint graph learning task by providing a regularized maximum likelihood estimator. Finally, we compare the proposed algorithm with different baselines and evaluate its performance over synthetic and real-world graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Segmenting the fine structure of the mouse brain on magnetic resonance (MR) images is critical for delineating morphological regions, analyzing brain function, and understanding their relationships. Compared to a single MRI modality, multimodal MRI data provide complementary tissue features that can be exploited by deep learning models, resulting in better segmentation results. However, multimodal mouse brain MRI data is often lacking, making automatic segmentation of mouse brain fine structure a very challenging task. To address this issue, it is necessary to fuse multimodal MRI data to produce distinguished contrasts in different brain structures. Hence, we propose a novel disentangled and contrastive GAN-based framework, named MouseGAN++, to synthesize multiple MR modalities from single ones in a structure-preserving manner, thus improving the segmentation performance by imputing missing modalities and multi-modality fusion. Our results demonstrate that the translation performance of our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Using the subsequently learned modality-invariant information as well as the modality-translated images, MouseGAN++ can segment fine brain structures with averaged dice coefficients of 90.0% (T2w) and 87.9% (T1w), respectively, achieving around +10% performance improvement compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our results demonstrate that MouseGAN++, as a simultaneous image synthesis and segmentation method, can be used to fuse cross-modality information in an unpaired manner and yield more robust performance in the absence of multimodal data. We release our method as a mouse brain structural segmentation tool for free academic usage at https://github.com/yu02019. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate activity location prediction is a crucial component of many mobility applications and is particularly required to develop personalized, sustainable transportation systems. Despite the widespread adoption of deep learning models, next location prediction models lack a comprehensive discussion and integration of mobility-related spatio-temporal contexts. Here, we utilize a multi-head self-attentional (MHSA) neural network that learns location transition patterns from historical location visits, their visit time and activity duration, as well as their surrounding land use functions, to infer an individual's next location. Specifically, we adopt point-of-interest data and latent Dirichlet allocation for representing locations' land use contexts at multiple spatial scales, generate embedding vectors of the spatio-temporal features, and learn to predict the next location with an MHSA network. Through experiments on two large-scale GNSS tracking datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art prediction models, and reveal the contribution of various spatio-temporal contexts to the model's performance. Moreover, we find that the model trained on population data achieves higher prediction performance with fewer parameters than individual-level models due to learning from collective movement patterns. We also reveal mobility conducted in the recent past and one week before has the largest influence on the current prediction, showing that learning from a subset of the historical mobility is sufficient to obtain an accurate location prediction result. We believe that the proposed model is vital for context-aware mobility prediction. The gained insights will help to understand location prediction models and promote their implementation for mobility applications. ",

    "abstract": "Automated audio captioning is a cross-modal translation task for describing the content of audio clips with natural language sentences. This task has attracted increasing attention and substantial progress has been made in recent years. Captions generated by existing models are generally faithful to the content of audio clips, however, these machine-generated captions are often deterministic (e.g., generating a fixed caption for a given audio clip), simple (e.g., using common words and simple grammar), and generic (e.g., generating the same caption for similar audio clips). When people are asked to describe the content of an audio clip, different people tend to focus on different sound events and describe an audio clip diversely from various aspects using distinct words and grammar. We believe that an audio captioning system should have the ability to generate diverse captions, either for a fixed audio clip, or across similar audio clips. To this end, we propose an adversarial training framework based on a conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) to improve diversity of audio captioning systems. A caption generator and two hybrid discriminators compete and are learned jointly, where the caption generator can be any standard encoder-decoder captioning model used to generate captions, and the hybrid discriminators assess the generated captions from different criteria, such as their naturalness and semantics. We conduct experiments on the Clotho dataset. The results show that our proposed model can generate captions with better diversity as compared to state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary scenarios describing the evolution of a family of genes within a collection of species comprise the mapping of the vertices of a gene tree $T$ to vertices and edges of a species tree $S$. The relative timing of the last common ancestors of two extant genes (leaves of $T$) and the last common ancestors of the two species (leaves of $S$) in which they reside is indicative of horizontal gene transfers (HGT) and ancient duplications. Orthologous gene pairs, on the other hand, require that their last common ancestors coincides with a corresponding speciation event. The relative timing information of gene and species divergences is captured by three colored graphs that have the extant genes as vertices and the species in which the genes are found as vertex colors: the equal-divergence-time (EDT) graph, the later-divergence-time (LDT) graph and the prior-divergence-time (PDT) graph, which together form an edge partition of the complete graph. Here we give a complete characterization in terms of informative and forbidden triples that can be read off the three graphs and provide a polynomial time algorithm for constructing an evolutionary scenario that explains the graphs, provided such a scenario exists. While both LDT and PDT graphs are cographs, this is not true for the EDT graph in general. We show that every EDT graph is perfect. While the information about LDT and PDT graphs is necessary to recognize EDT graphs in polynomial-time for general scenarios, this extra information can be dropped in the HGT-free case. However, recognition of EDT graphs without knowledge of putative LDT and PDT graphs is NP-complete for general scenarios. We finally connect the EDT graph to the alternative definitions of orthology that have been proposed for scenarios with horizontal gene transfer. With one exception, the corresponding graphs are shown to be colored cographs. ",

Challenging has been developing principled and interpretable approaches for fusing the modalities, specifically approaches enabling inference of latent source spaces representative of neural activity.

Specifically, we develop a symmetric method consisting of a cyclic convolutional transcoder that transcodes EEG to fMRI and vice versa. Without any prior knowledge of either the hemodynamic response function or lead field matrix, the complete data-driven method exploits the temporal and spatial relationships between the modalities and latent source spaces to learn these mappings. We quantify, for both the simulated and real EEG-fMRI data, how well the modalities can be transcoded from one to another as well as the source spaces that are recovered, all evaluated on unseen data. In addition to enabling a new way to symmetrically infer a latent source space, the method can also be seen as low-cost computational neuroimaging -- i.e. generating an 'expensive' fMRI BOLD image from 'low cost' EEG data.

Beyond task-related activations, the human brain has some intrinsic activity at a task-negative (resting) state that surprisingly consumes a lot of energy to support communication among neurons. Recent neuroimaging research has also seen an increase in modeling and analyzing brain activity in terms of a graph or network. Since graph models facilitate a systems-theoretic explanation of the brain, they have become increasingly relevant with advances in network science and the popularization of complex systems theory. The purpose of this study is to look into the abnormalities in resting brain functions in adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The primary goal is to investigate resting-state functional connectivity (FC), which can be construed as a significant temporal coincidence in blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signals between functionally related brain regions in the absence of any stimulus or task. When compared to healthy controls, ADHD patients have lower average connectivity in the Supramarginal Gyrus and Superior Parietal Lobule, but higher connectivity in the Lateral Occipital Cortex and Inferior Temporal Gyrus. We also hypothesize that the network organization of default mode and dorsal attention regions is abnormal in ADHD patients. ",

A state-of-the-art observational causal discovery algorithm for time series capable of handling latent confounders and contemporaneous effects, called LPCMCI, is extended to profit from casual constraints found through randomized control trials. Numerical results show that, given perfect interventional constraints, the reconstructed structural causal models (SCMs) of the extended LPCMCI allow 84.6% of the time for the optimal prediction of the target variable. The implementation of interventional and observational causal discovery is modular, allowing causal constraints from other sources. The second part of this thesis investigates the question of regret minimizing control by simultaneously learning a causal model and planning actions through the causal model. The idea is that an agent to optimize a measured variable first learns the system's mechanics through observational causal discovery. The agent then intervenes on the most promising variable with randomized values allowing for the exploitation and generation of new interventional data. The agent then uses the interventional data to enhance the causal model further, allowing improved actions the next time. The extended LPCMCI can be favorable compared to the original LPCMCI algorithm. The numerical results show that detecting and using interventional constraints leads to reconstructed SCMs that allow 60.9% of the time for the optimal prediction of the target variable in contrast to the baseline of 53.6% when using the original LPCMCI algorithm. Furthermore, the induced average regret decreases from 1.2 when using the original LPCMCI algorithm to 1.0 when using the extended LPCMCI algorithm with interventional discovery. ",

    "abstract": "Covariate distribution shifts and adversarial perturbations present robustness challenges to the conventional statistical learning framework: seemingly small unconceivable shifts in the test covariate distribution can significantly affect the performance of the statistical model learned based on the training distribution. The model performance typically deteriorates when extrapolation happens: namely, covariates shift to a region where the training distribution is scarce, and naturally, the learned model has little information. For robustness and regularization considerations, adversarial perturbation techniques are proposed as a remedy; however, more needs to be studied about what extrapolation region adversarial covariate shift will focus on, given a learned model. This paper precisely characterizes the extrapolation region, examining both regression and classification in an infinite-dimensional setting. We study the implications of adversarial covariate shifts to subsequent learning of the equilibrium -- the Bayes optimal model -- in a sequential game framework. We exploit the dynamics of the adversarial learning game and reveal the curious effects of the covariate shift to equilibrium learning and experimental design. In particular, we establish two directional convergence results that exhibit distinctive phenomena: (1) a blessing in regression, the adversarial covariate shifts in an exponential rate to an optimal experimental design for rapid subsequent learning, (2) a curse in classification, the adversarial covariate shifts in a subquadratic rate fast to the hardest experimental design trapping subsequent learning.

    "abstract": "Malaria is a potentially fatal plasmodium parasite injected by female anopheles mosquitoes that infect red blood cells and millions worldwide yearly. However, specialists' manual screening in clinical practice is laborious and prone to error. Therefore, a novel Deep Boosted and Ensemble Learning (DBEL) framework, comprising the stacking of new Boosted-BR-STM convolutional neural networks (CNN) and ensemble classifiers, is developed to screen malaria parasite images. The proposed STM-SB-BRNet is based on a new dilated-convolutional block-based split transform merge (STM) and feature-map Squeezing-Boosting (SB) ideas. Moreover, the new STM block uses regional and boundary operations to learn the malaria parasite's homogeneity, heterogeneity, and boundary with patterns. Furthermore, the diverse boosted channels are attained by employing Transfer Learning-based new feature-map SB in STM blocks at the abstract, medium, and conclusion levels to learn minute intensity and texture variation of the parasitic pattern. The proposed DBEL framework implicates the stacking of prominent and diverse boosted channels and provides the generated discriminative features of the developed Boosted-BR-STM to the ensemble of ML classifiers. The proposed framework improves the discrimination ability and generalization of ensemble learning. Moreover, the deep feature spaces of the developed Boosted-BR-STM and customized CNNs are fed into ML classifiers for comparative analysis. The proposed DBEL framework outperforms the existing techniques on the NIH malaria dataset that are enhanced using discrete wavelet transform to enrich feature space. The proposed DBEL framework achieved accuracy (98.50%), sensitivity (0.9920), F-score (0.9850), and AUC (0.997), which suggest it to be utilized for malaria parasite screening. ",
