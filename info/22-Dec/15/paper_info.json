    "abstract": "Non-invasive brain-computer interface technology has been developed for detecting human mental states with high performances. Detection of the pilots' mental states is particularly critical because their abnormal mental states could cause catastrophic accidents. In this study, we presented the feasibility of classifying distraction levels (namely, normal state, low distraction, and high distraction) by applying the deep learning method. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to classify distraction levels under a flight environment. We proposed a model for classifying distraction levels. A total of ten pilots conducted the experiment in a simulated flight environment. The grand-average accuracy was 0.8437 for classifying distraction levels across all subjects. Hence, we believe that it will contribute significantly to autonomous driving or flight based on artificial intelligence technology in the future. ",

    "abstract": "Our work targets at searching feasible adversarial perturbation to attack a classifier with high-dimensional categorical inputs in a domain-agnostic setting. This is intrinsically an NP-hard knapsack problem where the exploration space becomes explosively larger as the feature dimension increases. Without the help of domain knowledge, solving this problem via heuristic method, such as Branch-and-Bound, suffers from exponential complexity, yet can bring arbitrarily bad attack results. We address the challenge via the lens of multi-armed bandit based combinatorial search. Our proposed method, namely FEAT, treats modifying each categorical feature as pulling an arm in multi-armed bandit programming. Our objective is to achieve highly efficient and effective attack using an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)-enhanced Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) exploration strategy. Our theoretical analysis bounding the regret gap of FEAT guarantees its practical attack performance. In empirical analysis, we compare FEAT with other state-of-the-art domain-agnostic attack methods over various real-world categorical data sets of different applications. Substantial experimental observations confirm the expected efficiency and attack effectiveness of FEAT applied in different application scenarios. Our work further hints the applicability of FEAT for assessing the adversarial vulnerability of classification systems with high-dimensional categorical inputs. ",

    "abstract": "We present a method for providing statistical guarantees on runtime safety and goal reachability for integrated planning and control of a class of systems with unknown nonlinear stochastic underactuated dynamics. Specifically, given a dynamics dataset, our method jointly learns a mean dynamics model, a spatially-varying disturbance bound that captures the effect of noise and model mismatch, and a feedback controller based on contraction theory that stabilizes the learned dynamics. We propose a sampling-based planner that uses the mean dynamics model and simultaneously bounds the closed-loop tracking error via a learned disturbance bound. We employ techniques from Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to estimate, to a specified level of confidence, several constants which characterize the learned components and govern the size of the tracking error bound. This ensures plans are guaranteed to be safely tracked at runtime. We validate that our guarantees translate to empirical safety in simulation on a 10D quadrotor, and in the real world on a physical CrazyFlie quadrotor and Clearpath Jackal robot, whereas baselines that ignore the model error and stochasticity are unsafe.

    "abstract": "Accurate vulnerability assessment of critical infrastructure systems is cardinal to enhance infrastructure resilience. Unlike traditional approaches, this paper proposes a novel infrastructure vulnerability assessment framework that accounts for: various types of infrastructure interdependencies including physical, logical and geographical from a holistic perspective; lack of/incomplete information on supply-demand flow characteristics of interdependent infrastructure; and, unavailability/inadequate data on infrastructure network topology and/or interdependencies. Specifically, this paper models multi-infrastructure vulnerabilities leveraging simulation-based hybrid approach coupled with time-dependent Bayesian network analysis while considering cascading failures within and across CIS networks, under incomplete information. Existing synthetic data on electricity, water and supply chain networks are used to implement/validate the framework. Infrastructure vulnerabilities are depicted on a geo-map using Voronoi polygons. Our results indicate that infrastructure vulnerability is inversely proportional to the number of redundancies inbuilt in the infrastructure system, indicating that allocating resources to add redundancies in an existing infrastructure system is essential to reduce its risk of failure. It is observed that higher the initial failure rate of the components, higher is the vulnerability of the infrastructure, highlighting the importance of modernizing and upgrading the infrastructure system aiming to reduce the initial failure probabilities. Our results also underline the importance of collaborative working and sharing the necessary information among multiple infrastructure systems, aiming towards minimizing the overall failure risk of interdependent infrastructure systems.

    "abstract": "Many commodity crops have growth stages during which they are particularly vulnerable to stress-induced yield loss. In-season crop progress information is useful for quantifying crop risk, and satellite remote sensing (RS) can be used to track progress at regional scales. At present, all existing RS-based crop progress estimation (CPE) methods which target crop-specific stages rely on ground truth data for training/calibration. This reliance on ground survey data confines CPE methods to surveyed regions, limiting their utility. In this study, a new method is developed for conducting RS-based in-season CPE in unsurveyed regions by combining data from surveyed regions with synthetic crop progress data generated for an unsurveyed region. Corn-growing zones in Argentina were used as surrogate 'unsurveyed' regions. Existing weather generation, crop growth, and optical radiative transfer models were linked to produce synthetic weather, crop progress, and canopy reflectance data. A neural network (NN) method based upon bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory was trained separately on surveyed data, synthetic data, and two different combinations of surveyed and synthetic data. A stopping criterion was developed which uses the weighted divergence of surveyed and synthetic data validation loss. Net F1 scores across all crop progress stages increased by 8.7% when trained on a combination of surveyed region and synthetic data, and overall performance was only 21% lower than when the NN was trained on surveyed data and applied in the US Midwest. Performance gain from synthetic data was greatest in zones with dual planting windows, while the inclusion of surveyed region data from the US Midwest helped mitigate NN sensitivity to noise in NDVI data. Overall results suggest in-season CPE in other unsurveyed regions may be possible with increased quantity and variety of synthetic crop progress data. ",

In this work, we introduce a new graph PE, Graph Automaton PE (GAPE), based on weighted graph-walking automata (a novel extension of graph-walking automata). We compare the performance of GAPE with other PE schemes on both machine translation and graph-structured tasks, and we show that it generalizes several other PEs. An additional contribution of this study is a theoretical and controlled experimental comparison of many recent PEs in graph transformers, independent of the use of edge features. ",

Several factors such as data, model prediction, hyperparameters used in training the model, and random initialization can all influence downstream explanations. While previous work empirically hinted that explanations (E) may have little relationship with the prediction (Y), there is a lack of conclusive study to quantify this relationship. Our work borrows tools from causal inference to systematically assay this relationship. More specifically, we measure the relationship between E and Y by measuring the treatment effect when intervening on their causal ancestors (hyperparameters) (inputs to generate saliency-based Es or Ys). We discover that Y's relative direct influence on E follows an odd pattern; the influence is higher in the lowest-performing models than in mid-performing models, and it then decreases in the top-performing models. We believe our work is a promising first step towards providing better guidance for practitioners who can make more informed decisions in utilizing these explanations by knowing what factors are at play and how they relate to their end task.

When defining the semantics of a programming language, expressions naturally form abstract syntax trees, or, terms. However, in order to facilitate sharing of common subexpressions, modern compilers represent expressions as term graphs. Defining the semantics of term graphs is more complicated than defining the semantics of their equivalent term representations. More significantly, defining optimizations directly on term graphs and proving semantics preservation is considerably more complicated than on the equivalent term representations. On terms, optimizations can be expressed as conditional term rewriting rules, and proofs that the rewrites are semantics preserving are relatively straightforward. In this paper, we explore an approach to using term rewrites to verify term graph transformations of optimizations within the GraalVM compiler. This approach significantly reduces the overall verification effort and allows for simpler encoding of optimization rules. ",

Facial recognition is a sort of biometric authentication with various applications, such as unlocking mobile phones and accessing bank accounts. However, presentation attacks pose the greatest threat to facial recognition. A presentation attack is an attempt to present a non-live face, such as a photo, video, mask, and makeup, to the camera. Presentation attack detection is a countermeasure that attempts to identify between a genuine user and a presentation attack. Several industries, such as financial services, healthcare, and education, use biometric authentication services on various devices. This illustrates the significance of presentation attack detection as the verification step. In this paper, we study state-of-the-art to cover the challenges and solutions related to presentation attack detection in a single place. We identify and classify different presentation attack types and identify the state-of-the-art methods that could be used to detect each of them. We compare the state-of-the-art literature regarding attack types, evaluation metrics, accuracy, and datasets and discuss research and industry challenges of presentation attack detection. Most presentation attack detection approaches rely on extensive data training and quality, making them difficult to implement. We introduce an efficient active presentation attack detection approach that overcomes weaknesses in the existing literature. The proposed approach does not require training data, is CPU-light, can process low-quality images, has been tested with users of various ages and is shown to be user-friendly and highly robust to 2-dimensional presentation attacks.

However, this requires laborious model-tuning by the end-user who may prefer to have a system that works ``out-of-the-box.\" To address such practical scenarios, we identify a novel target domain (inference-time) VAD task where no target domain training data are available. To this end, we propose a new `Zero-shot Cross-domain Video Anomaly Detection (zxvad)' framework that includes a future-frame prediction generative model setup. Different from prior future-frame prediction models, our model uses a novel Normalcy Classifier module to learn the features of normal event videos by learning how such features are different ``relatively\" to features in pseudo-abnormal examples. A novel Untrained Convolutional Neural Network based Anomaly Synthesis module crafts these pseudo-abnormal examples by adding foreign objects in normal video frames with no extra training cost. With our novel relative normalcy feature learning strategy, zxvad generalizes and learns to distinguish between normal and abnormal frames in a new target domain without adaptation during inference. Through evaluations on common datasets, we show that zxvad outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA), regardless of whether task-relevant (i.e., VAD) source training data are available or not. Lastly, zxvad also beats the SOTA methods in inference-time efficiency metrics including the model size, total parameters, GPU energy consumption, and GMACs. ",

We first identify two key factors during model adaption -- training losses and adaptation methods -- that affect the model's zero-shot adversarial robustness. We then propose a text-guided contrastive adversarial training loss, which aligns the text embeddings and the adversarial visual features with contrastive learning on a small set of training data. We apply this training loss to two adaption methods, model finetuning and visual prompt tuning. We find that visual prompt tuning is more effective in the absence of texts, while finetuning wins in the existence of text guidance. Overall, our approach significantly improves the zero-shot adversarial robustness over CLIP, seeing an average improvement of over 31 points over ImageNet and 15 zero-shot datasets. We hope this work can shed light on understanding the zero-shot adversarial robustness of large-scale models. ",

Several studies have improved the worst-group accuracy by focusing on the high-loss samples. The hypothesis behind this is that such high-loss samples are \\textit{spurious-cue-free} (SCF) samples. However, these approaches can be problematic since the high-loss samples may also be samples with noisy labels in the real-world scenarios. To resolve this issue, we utilize the predictive uncertainty of a model to improve the worst-group accuracy under noisy labels. To motivate this, we theoretically show that the high-uncertainty samples are the SCF samples in the binary classification problem. This theoretical result implies that the predictive uncertainty is an adequate indicator to identify SCF samples in a noisy label setting. Motivated from this, we propose a novel ENtropy based Debiasing (END) framework that prevents models from learning the spurious cues while being robust to the noisy labels. In the END framework, we first train the \\textit{identification model} to obtain the SCF samples from a training set using its predictive uncertainty. Then, another model is trained on the dataset augmented with an oversampled SCF set. The experimental results show that our END framework outperforms other strong baselines on several real-world benchmarks that consider both the noisy labels and the spurious-cues. ",

Quite a great amount of studies have been devoted to designing complex algorithms to improve recommendation performance, where deep learning methods account for the majority. However, most of these methods are black-box ones and ignore to provide moderate explanations to facilitate users' understanding, which thus might lead to lowered user satisfaction and reduced system revenues. Therefore, in our study, we propose a generic Reinforced Explainable framework with Knowledge graph for Session-based recommendation (i.e., REKS), which strives to improve the existing black-box SR models (denoted as non-explainable ones) with Markov decision process. In particular, we construct a knowledge graph with session behaviors and treat SR models as part of the policy network of Markov decision process. Based on our particularly designed state vector, reward strategy, and loss function, the reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework not only achieves improved recommendation accuracy, but also provides appropriate explanations at the same time. Finally, we instantiate the REKS in five representative, state-of-the-art SR models (i.e., GRU4REC, NARM, SR-GNN, GCSAN, BERT4REC), whereby extensive experiments towards these methods on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on both recommendation and explanation tasks.

    "abstract": "Contrastive learning (CL), which can extract the information shared between different contrastive views, has become a popular paradigm for vision representation learning. Inspired by the success in computer vision, recent work introduces CL into graph modeling, dubbed as graph contrastive learning (GCL). However, generating contrastive views in graphs is more challenging than that in images, since we have little prior knowledge on how to significantly augment a graph without changing its labels. We argue that typical data augmentation techniques (e.g., edge dropping) in GCL cannot generate diverse enough contrastive views to filter out noises. Moreover, previous GCL methods employ two view encoders with exactly the same neural architecture and tied parameters, which further harms the diversity of augmented views. To address this limitation, we propose a novel paradigm named model augmented GCL (MA-GCL), which will focus on manipulating the architectures of view encoders instead of perturbing graph inputs. Specifically, we present three easy-to-implement model augmentation tricks for GCL, namely asymmetric, random and shuffling, which can respectively help alleviate high- frequency noises, enrich training instances and bring safer augmentations. All three tricks are compatible with typical data augmentations. Experimental results show that MA-GCL can achieve state-of-the-art performance on node classification benchmarks by applying the three tricks on a simple base model. Extensive studies also validate our motivation and the effectiveness of each trick. (Code, data and appendix are available at https://github.com/GXM1141/MA-GCL. ) ",

    "abstract": "As a neural network compression technique, post-training quantization (PTQ) transforms a pre-trained model into a quantized model using a lower-precision data type. However, the prediction accuracy will decrease because of the quantization noise, especially in extremely low-bit settings. How to determine the appropriate quantization parameters (e.g., scaling factors and rounding of weights) is the main problem facing now. Many existing methods determine the quantization parameters by minimizing the distance between features before and after quantization. Using this distance as the metric to optimize the quantization parameters only considers local information. We analyze the problem of minimizing local metrics and indicate that it would not result in optimal quantization parameters. Furthermore, the quantized model suffers from overfitting due to the small number of calibration samples in PTQ. In this paper, we propose PD-Quant to solve the problems. PD-Quant uses the information of differences between network prediction before and after quantization to determine the quantization parameters. To mitigate the overfitting problem, PD-Quant adjusts the distribution of activations in PTQ. Experiments show that PD-Quant leads to better quantization parameters and improves the prediction accuracy of quantized models, especially in low-bit settings. For example, PD-Quant pushes the accuracy of ResNet-18 up to 53.08% and RegNetX-600MF up to 40.92% in weight 2-bit activation 2-bit. The code will be released at https://github.com/hustvl/PD-Quant.

    "abstract": "Explainability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is critical to various GNN applications but remains an open challenge. A convincing explanation should be both necessary and sufficient simultaneously. However, existing GNN explaining approaches focus on only one of the two aspects, necessity or sufficiency, or a trade-off between the two. To search for the most necessary and sufficient explanation, the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS) can be applied since it can mathematically quantify the necessity and sufficiency of an explanation. Nevertheless, the difficulty of obtaining PNS due to non-monotonicity and the challenge of counterfactual estimation limits its wide use. To address the non-identifiability of PNS, we resort to a lower bound of PNS that can be optimized via counterfactual estimation, and propose Necessary and Sufficient Explanation for GNN (NSEG) via optimizing that lower bound. Specifically, we employ nearest neighbor matching to generate counterfactual samples for the features, which is different from the random perturbation. In particular, NSEG combines the edges and node features to generate an explanation, where the common edge explanation is a special case of the combined explanation. Empirical study shows that NSEG achieves excellent performance in generating the most necessary and sufficient explanations among a series of state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "Utilizing the latest advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), the computer vision community is now witnessing an unprecedented evolution in all kinds of perception tasks, particularly in object detection. Based on multiple spatially separated perception nodes, Cooperative Perception (CP) has emerged to significantly advance the perception of automated driving. However, current cooperative object detection methods mainly focus on ego-vehicle efficiency without considering the practical issues of system-wide costs. In this paper, we introduce VINet, a unified deep learning-based CP network for scalable, lightweight, and heterogeneous cooperative 3D object detection. VINet is the first CP method designed from the standpoint of large-scale system-level implementation and can be divided into three main phases: 1) Global Pre-Processing and Lightweight Feature Extraction which prepare the data into global style and extract features for cooperation in a lightweight manner; 2) Two-Stream Fusion which fuses the features from scalable and heterogeneous perception nodes; and 3) Central Feature Backbone and 3D Detection Head which further process the fused features and generate cooperative detection results. A cooperative perception platform is designed and developed for CP dataset acquisition and several baselines are compared during the experiments. The experimental analysis shows that VINet can achieve remarkable improvements for pedestrians and cars with 2x less system-wide computational costs and 12x less system-wide communicational costs. ",

Although complex-valued deep learning networks perform better than their real-valued counterparts for complex-valued SAR data, phase information is not retained throughout the network, which causes a loss of information. This paper proposes a Fully Complex-valued, Fully Convolutional Multi-feature Fusion Network(FC2MFN) for building semantic segmentation on InSAR images using a novel, fully complex-valued learning scheme. The network learns multi-scale features, performs multi-feature fusion, and has a complex-valued output. For the particularity of complex-valued InSAR data, a new complex-valued pooling layer is proposed that compares complex numbers considering their magnitude and phase. This helps the network retain the phase information even through the pooling layer. Experimental results on the simulated InSAR dataset show that FC2MFN achieves better results compared to other state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation performance and model complexity. ",

However, because continuous labeling of ever-changing emotional states is not feasible in practice, existing methods can only assign a fixed label to all EEG timepoints in a continuous emotion-evoking trial, which overlooks the highly dynamic emotional states and highly non-stationary EEG signals. To solve the problems of high reliance on fixed labels and ignorance of time-changing information, in this paper we propose a time-aware sampling network (TAS-Net) using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for unsupervised emotion recognition, which is able to detect key emotion fragments and disregard irrelevant and misleading parts. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets (SEED, DEAP, and MAHNOB-HCI) for emotion recognition using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, and the results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method against previous unsupervised emotion recognition methods.

    "abstract": "The de-anonymization of users from anonymized microdata through matching or aligning with publicly-available correlated databases has been of scientific interest recently. While most of the rigorous analyses of database matching have focused on random-distortion models, the adversarial-distortion models have been wanting in the relevant literature. In this work, motivated by synchronization errors in the sampling of time-indexed microdata, matching (alignment) of random databases under adversarial column deletions is investigated. It is assumed that a constrained adversary, which observes the anonymized database, can delete up to a $\\delta$ fraction of the columns (attributes) to hinder matching and preserve privacy. Column histograms of the two databases are utilized as permutation-invariant features to detect the column deletion pattern chosen by the adversary. The detection of the column deletion pattern is then followed by an exact row (user) matching scheme. The worst-case analysis of this two-phase scheme yields a sufficient condition for the successful matching of the two databases, under the near-perfect recovery condition. A more detailed investigation of the error probability leads to a tight necessary condition on the database growth rate, and in turn, to a single-letter characterization of the adversarial matching capacity. This adversarial matching capacity is shown to be significantly lower than the \\say{random} matching capacity, where the column deletions occur randomly. Overall, our results analytically demonstrate the privacy-wise advantages of adversarial mechanisms over random ones during the publication of anonymized time-indexed data. ",

Due to the interference constraint, only disjoint source-channel pairs can be chosen for transmission in each time slot, and the decision maker should choose the optimal scheduling pairs to minimize the average AoI at the destination. To learn the optimal channel selection, we apply the linear contextual bandit (LCB) framework by utilizing the sided information provided by pilots. Concretely, we establish the relationship between AoI regret and sub-optimal channel selection times and propose both age-independent and age-dependent algorithms. The former method is proven to achieve the sub-linear AoI regret but is outperformed by the latter algorithm both in the linear and non-linear contextual model in simulation. ",

DNN predictions cannot be assumed to be always correct for several reasons, among which the huge input space that is dealt with, the ambiguity of some inputs data, as well as the intrinsic properties of learning algorithms, which can provide only statistical warranties. Hence, developers have to cope with some residual error probability. An architectural pattern commonly adopted to manage failure-prone components is the supervisor, an additional component that can estimate the reliability of the predictions made by untrusted (e.g., DNN) components and can activate an automated healing procedure when these are likely to fail, ensuring that the Deep Learning based System (DLS) does not cause damages, despite its main functionality being suspended. In this paper, we consider DLS that implement a supervisor by means of uncertainty estimation. After overviewing the main approaches to uncertainty estimation and discussing their pros and cons, we motivate the need for a specific empirical assessment method that can deal with the experimental setting in which supervisors are used, where the accuracy of the DNN matters only as long as the supervisor lets the DLS continue to operate. Then we present a large empirical study conducted to compare the alternative approaches to uncertainty estimation. We distilled a set of guidelines for developers that are useful to incorporate a supervisor based on uncertainty monitoring into a DLS. ",

We systematically evaluate a set of competitive neural architectures on MIST.

One of the most representative TasNets is a network with a dual-path segmentation approach. However, the original model called DPRNN used a fixed feature dimension and unchanged segment size throughout all layers of the network. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion transformer network (MSFFT-Net) based on the conventional dual-path structure for single-channel speech separation. Unlike the conventional dual-path structure where only one processing path exists, adopting several iterative blocks with alternative intra-chunk and inter-chunk operations to capture local and global context information, the proposed MSFFT-Net has multiple parallel processing paths where the feature information can be exchanged between multiple parallel processing paths. Experiments show that our proposed networks based on multi-scale feature fusion structure have achieved better results than the original dual-path model on the benchmark dataset-WSJ0-2mix, where the SI-SNRi score of MSFFT-3P is 20.7dB (1.47% improvement), and MSFFT-2P is 21.0dB (3.45% improvement), which achieves SOTA on WSJ0-2mix without any data augmentation method.

We address this challenge by proposing a robust multitarget tracking algorithm, which estimates the states of clutter and targets simultaneously by the message-passing (MP) approach. We define the non-homogeneous clutter with a finite mixture model containing a uniform component and multiple nonuniform components. The measured signal strength is utilized to estimate the mean signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of targets and the mean clutter-to-noise ratio (CNR) of clutter, which are then used as additional feature information of targets and clutter to improve the performance of discrimination of targets from clutter. We also present a hybrid data association which can reason over correspondence between targets, clutter, and measurements. Then, a unified MP algorithm is used to infer the marginal posterior probability distributions of targets, clutter, and data association by splitting the joint probability distribution into a mean-field approximate part and a belief propagation part. As a result, a closed-loop iterative optimization of the posterior probability distribution can be obtained, which can effectively deal with the coupling between target tracking, clutter estimation and data association. Simulation results demonstrate the performance superiority and robustness of the proposed multitarget tracking algorithm compared with the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter and the cardinalized PHD (CPHD) filter.

This paper proposes a deep encoder-decoder prediction framework based on variational Bayesian inference. A Bayesian neural network is constructed by combining variational inference with gated recurrent units (GRU) and used as the deep neural network unit of the encoder-decoder framework to mine the intrinsic dynamics of traffic flow. Then, the variational inference is introduced into the multi-head attention mechanism to avoid noise-induced deterioration of prediction accuracy.

In particular, universal coverings and complete unfoldings are infinite trees that are regular if the initial graphs are finite. Regularity means that a tree has finitely many subtrees up to isomorphism. Two important theorems have been established by Leighton and Norris for coverings. We prove similar statements for unfoldings. Our study of the difficult proof of Leighton's Theorem lead us to generalize coverings and similarly, unfoldings, by attaching finite or infinite weights to edges of the covered or unfolded graphs. This generalization yields a canonical factorization of the universal covering of any finite graph, that (provably) does not exist without using weights. Introducing infinite weights provides us with finite descriptions of regular trees having nodes of countably infinite degree.

Conventional optimization-based methods usually fail to produce accurate results due to corrupted and noisy relative measurements. Recent learning-based approaches regard MRA as a regression problem, while these methods are sensitive to initialization due to the gauge freedom problem. To handle these problems, we propose a learnable iterative graph optimizer minimizing a gauge-invariant cost function with an edge rectification strategy to mitigate the effect of inaccurate measurements. Our graph optimizer iteratively refines the global camera rotations by minimizing each node's single rotation objective function. Besides, our approach iteratively rectifies relative rotations to make them more consistent with the current camera orientations and observed relative rotations. Furthermore, we employ a gated recurrent unit to improve the result by tracing the temporal information of the cost graph. Our framework is a real-time learning-to-optimize rotation averaging graph optimizer with a tiny size deployed for real-world applications.

    "title": "Directional Direct Feedback Alignment: Estimating Backpropagation Paths  for Efficient Learning on Neural Processors",
    "abstract": "The error Backpropagation algorithm (BP) is a key method for training deep neural networks. While performant, it is also resource-demanding in terms of computation, memory usage and energy. This makes it unsuitable for online learning on edge devices that require a high processing rate and low energy consumption. More importantly, BP does not take advantage of the parallelism and local characteristics offered by dedicated neural processors. There is therefore a demand for alternative algorithms to BP that could improve the latency, memory requirements, and energy footprint of neural networks on hardware. In this work, we propose a novel method based on Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) which uses Forward-Mode Automatic Differentiation to estimate backpropagation paths and learn feedback connections in an online manner. We experimentally show that Directional DFA achieves performances that are closer to BP than other feedback methods on several benchmark datasets and architectures while benefiting from the locality and parallelization characteristics of DFA. Moreover, we show that, unlike other feedback learning algorithms, our method provides stable learning for convolution layers. ",

    "abstract": "Training adversarially robust discriminative (i.e., softmax) classifier has been the dominant approach to robust classification. Building on recent work on adversarial training (AT)-based generative models, we investigate using AT to learn unnormalized class-conditional density models and then performing generative robust classification. Our result shows that, under the condition of similar model capacities, the generative robust classifier achieves comparable performance to a baseline softmax robust classifier when the test data is clean or when the test perturbation is of limited size, and much better performance when the test perturbation size exceeds the training perturbation size. The generative classifier is also able to generate samples or counterfactuals that more closely resemble the training data, suggesting that the generative classifier can better capture the class-conditional distributions. In contrast to standard discriminative adversarial training where advanced data augmentation techniques are only effective when combined with weight averaging, we find it straightforward to apply advanced data augmentation to achieve better robustness in our approach. Our result suggests that the generative classifier is a competitive alternative to robust classification, especially for problems with limited number of classes. ",

MANTa is a differentiable tokenizer trained end-to-end with the language model. The resulting system offers a trade-off between the expressiveness of byte-level models and the speed of models trained using subword tokenization. In addition, our tokenizer is highly explainable since it produces an explicit segmentation of sequences into blocks. We evaluate our pre-trained model on several English datasets from different domains as well as on synthetic noise. We find that MANTa improves robustness to character perturbations and out-of-domain data. We then show that MANTa performs comparably to other models on the general-domain GLUE benchmark. Finally, we show that it is considerably faster than strictly byte-level models. ",

    "abstract": "Although DETR-based 3D detectors can simplify the detection pipeline and achieve direct sparse predictions, their performance still lags behind dense detectors with post-processing for 3D object detection from point clouds. DETRs usually adopt a larger number of queries than GTs (e.g., 300 queries v.s. 40 objects in Waymo) in a scene, which inevitably incur many false positives during inference. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective sparse 3D detector, named Query Contrast Voxel-DETR (ConQueR), to eliminate the challenging false positives, and achieve more accurate and sparser predictions. We observe that most false positives are highly overlapping in local regions, caused by the lack of explicit supervision to discriminate locally similar queries. We thus propose a Query Contrast mechanism to explicitly enhance queries towards their best-matched GTs over all unmatched query predictions. This is achieved by the construction of positive and negative GT-query pairs for each GT, and a contrastive loss to enhance positive GT-query pairs against negative ones based on feature similarities. ConQueR closes the gap of sparse and dense 3D detectors, and reduces up to ~60% false positives. Our single-frame ConQueR achieves new state-of-the-art (sota) 71.6 mAPH/L2 on the challenging Waymo Open Dataset validation set, outperforming previous sota methods (e.g., PV-RCNN++) by over 2.0 mAPH/L2.

Part I of this paper presented a methodology for arguing the subspace invariance of a Koopman dictionary. This methodology was demonstrated on the state-inclusive logistic lifting (SILL) basis. This is an affine basis augmented with conjunctive logistic functions. The SILL dictionary's nonlinear functions are homogeneous, a norm in data-driven dictionary learning of Koopman operators. In this paper, we discover that structured mixing of heterogeneous dictionary functions drawn from different classes of nonlinear functions achieve the same accuracy and dimensional scaling as the deep-learning-based deepDMD algorithm. We specifically show this by building a heterogeneous dictionary comprised of SILL functions and conjunctive radial basis functions (RBFs). This mixed dictionary achieves the same accuracy and dimensional scaling as deepDMD with an order of magnitude reduction in parameters, while maintaining geometric interpretability. These results strengthen the viability of dictionary-based Koopman models to solving high-dimensional nonlinear learning problems. ",

While studies over extending 2D StyleGAN to 3D faces have emerged, a corresponding generic 3D GAN inversion framework is still missing, limiting the applications of 3D face reconstruction and semantic editing. In this paper, we study the challenging problem of 3D GAN inversion where a latent code is predicted given a single face image to faithfully recover its 3D shapes and detailed textures. The problem is ill-posed: innumerable compositions of shape and texture could be rendered to the current image. Furthermore, with the limited capacity of a global latent code, 2D inversion methods cannot preserve faithful shape and texture at the same time when applied to 3D models. To solve this problem, we devise an effective self-training scheme to constrain the learning of inversion. The learning is done efficiently without any real-world 2D-3D training pairs but proxy samples generated from a 3D GAN. In addition, apart from a global latent code that captures the coarse shape and texture information, we augment the generation network with a local branch, where pixel-aligned features are added to faithfully reconstruct face details. We further consider a new pipeline to perform 3D view-consistent editing. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art inversion methods in both shape and texture reconstruction quality. Code and data will be released. ",

We analytically investigate the bifurcations and prove that the period-doubling bifurcation is the only possible bifurcation that may occur for all the considered models. The most important finding of our study is regarding the influence of players' rational levels on the stability of heterogeneous duopolistic competition. It is derived that the stability region of the model where the second firm is rational is the smallest, while that of the one where the second firm is boundedly rational is the largest.

    "title": "Maximal Initial Learning Rates in Deep ReLU Networks",
    "abstract": "Training a neural network requires choosing a suitable learning rate, involving a trade-off between speed and effectiveness of convergence. While there has been considerable theoretical and empirical analysis of how large the learning rate can be, most prior work focuses only on late-stage training. In this work, we introduce the maximal initial learning rate $\\eta^{\\ast}$ - the largest learning rate at which a randomly initialized neural network can successfully begin training and achieve (at least) a given threshold accuracy. Using a simple approach to estimate $\\eta^{\\ast}$, we observe that in constant-width fully-connected ReLU networks, $\\eta^{\\ast}$ demonstrates different behavior to the maximum learning rate later in training. Specifically, we find that $\\eta^{\\ast}$ is well predicted as a power of $(\\text{depth} \\times \\text{width})$, provided that (i) the width of the network is sufficiently large compared to the depth, and (ii) the input layer of the network is trained at a relatively small learning rate. We further analyze the relationship between $\\eta^{\\ast}$ and the sharpness $\\lambda_{1}$ of the network at initialization, indicating that they are closely though not inversely related. We formally prove bounds for $\\lambda_{1}$ in terms of $(\\text{depth} \\times \\text{width})$ that align with our empirical results. ",
