    "title": "Audio Denoising for Robust Audio Fingerprinting",
    "abstract": "Music discovery services let users identify songs from short mobile recordings. These solutions are often based on Audio Fingerprinting, and rely more specifically on the extraction of spectral peaks in order to be robust to a number of distortions. Few works have been done to study the robustness of these algorithms to background noise captured in real environments. In particular, AFP systems still struggle when the signal to noise ratio is low, i.e when the background noise is strong. In this project, we tackle this problematic with Deep Learning. We test a new hybrid strategy which consists of inserting a denoising DL model in front of a peak-based AFP algorithm. We simulate noisy music recordings using a realistic data augmentation pipeline, and train a DL model to denoise them. The denoising model limits the impact of background noise on the AFP system's extracted peaks, improving its robustness to noise. We further propose a novel loss function to adapt the DL model to the considered AFP system, increasing its precision in terms of retrieved spectral peaks. To the best of our knowledge, this hybrid strategy has not been tested before. ",

    "abstract": "The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence is to mimic the human brain to perform decision-making and control directly from high-dimensional sensory input. All-optical diffractive neural networks provide a promising solution for realizing artificial intelligence with high-speed and low-power consumption. To date, most of the reported diffractive neural networks focus on single or multiple tasks that do not involve interaction with the environment, such as object recognition and image classification, while the networks that can perform decision-making and control, to our knowledge, have not been developed yet. Here, we propose to use deep reinforcement learning to realize diffractive neural networks that enable imitating the human-level capability of decision-making and control. Such networks allow for finding optimal control policies through interaction with the environment and can be readily realized with the dielectric metasurfaces. The superior performances of these networks are verified by engaging three types of classic games, Tic-Tac-Toe, Super Mario Bros., and Car Racing, and achieving the same or even higher levels comparable to human players. Our work represents a solid step of advancement in diffractive neural networks, which promises a fundamental shift from the target-driven control of a pre-designed state for simple recognition or classification tasks to the high-level sensory capability of artificial intelligence. It may find exciting applications in autonomous driving, intelligent robots, and intelligent manufacturing. ",

    "abstract": "Before the transition of AVs to urban roads and subsequently unprecedented changes in traffic conditions, evaluation of transportation policies and futuristic road design related to pedestrian crossing behavior is of vital importance. Recent studies analyzed the non-causal impact of various variables on pedestrian waiting time in the presence of AVs. However, we mainly investigate the causal effect of traffic density on pedestrian waiting time. We develop a Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML) model in which the impact of confounders variable influencing both a policy and an outcome of interest is addressed, resulting in unbiased policy evaluation. Furthermore, we try to analyze the effect of traffic density by developing a copula-based joint model of two main components of pedestrian crossing behavior, pedestrian stress level and waiting time. The copula approach has been widely used in the literature, for addressing self-selection problems, which can be classified as a causality analysis in travel behavior modeling. The results obtained from copula approach and DML are compared based on the effect of traffic density. In DML model structure, the standard error term of density parameter is lower than copula approach and the confidence interval is considerably more reliable. In addition, despite the similar sign of effect, the copula approach estimates the effect of traffic density lower than DML, due to the spurious effect of confounders. In short, the DML model structure can flexibly adjust the impact of confounders by using machine learning algorithms and is more reliable for planning future policies. ",

In particular, with the increasing prevalence of accelerator technologies (e.g., GPUs and TPUs) and the emergence of domain-specific computing via ASICs and FPGA, the matter of heterogeneity and harnessing it has become a more critical challenge than ever before. Harnessing system heterogeneity has been a longstanding challenge in distributed systems and has been investigated extensively in the past. Making use of real infrastructure (such as those offered by the public cloud providers) for benchmarking the performance of heterogeneous machines, for different applications, with respect to different objectives, and under various workload intensities is cost- and time-prohibitive. To mitigate this burden, we develop an open-source simulation tool, called E2C, that can help researchers and practitioners study any type of heterogeneous computing system and measure its performance under various system configurations. E2C has an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that enables its users to easily examine system-level solutions (scheduling, load balancing, scalability, etc.) in a controlled environment within a short time and at no cost. In particular, E2C offers the following features: (i) simulating a heterogeneous computing system; (ii) implementing a newly developed scheduling method and plugging it into the system, (iii) measuring energy consumption and other output-related metrics; and (iv) powerful visual aspects to ease the learning curve for students. Potential users of E2C can be undergraduate and graduate students in computer science/engineering, researchers, and practitioners. ",

    "abstract": "Traditional approaches to RL have focused on learning decision policies directly from episodic decisions, while slowly and implicitly learning the semantics of compositional representations needed for generalization. While some approaches have been adopted to refine representations via auxiliary self-supervised losses while simultaneously learning decision policies, learning compositional representations from hand-designed and context-independent self-supervised losses (multi-view) still adapts relatively slowly to the real world, which contains many non-IID subspaces requiring rapid distribution shift in both time and spatial attention patterns at varying levels of abstraction. In contrast, supervised language model cascades have shown the flexibility to adapt to many diverse manifolds, and hints of self-learning needed for autonomous task transfer. However, to date, transfer methods for language models like few-shot learning and fine-tuning still require human supervision and transfer learning using self-learning methods has been underexplored. We propose a self-supervised loss policy called contrastive distillation which manifests latent variables with high mutual information with both source and target tasks from weights to tokens. We show how this outperforms common methods of transfer learning and suggests a useful design axis of trading off compute for generalizability for online transfer. Contrastive distillation is improved through sampling from memory and suggests a simple algorithm for more efficiently sampling negative examples for contrastive losses than random sampling. ",

To address this issue, we propose a projected upper bound on the utility of the patterns discovered from sequences of interval-based events.

Unfortunately, many of them are too subjective to be measured and presented in online social networks. On the other hand, data mining techniques can better find data patterns but many of them leave behind unnatural understanding. In this paper, we propose a fundamental methodology to support the further fusion of data mining techniques and sociological behavioral criteria. Our highlights are three-fold: First, we propose an effective hypergraph awareness and a fast line graph construction framework. The hypergraph can more profoundly indicate the interactions between individuals and their environments because each edge in the hypergraph (a.k.a hyperedge) contains more than two nodes, which is perfect to describe social environments. A line graph treats each social environment as a super node with the underlying influence between different environments. In this way, we go beyond traditional pair-wise relations and explore richer patterns under various sociological criteria; Second, we propose a novel hypergraph-based neural network to learn social influence flowing from users to users, users to environments, environment to users, and environments to environments. The neural network can be learned via a task-free method, making our model very flexible to support various data mining tasks and sociological analysis; Third, we propose both qualitative and quantitive solutions to effectively evaluate the most common sociological criteria like social conformity, social equivalence, environmental evolving and social polarization. Our extensive experiments show that our framework can better support both data mining tasks for online user behaviours and sociological analysis. ",

In this paper, we describe how we performed live penetration testing for a particular network, namely, 192.168.3.0/24 (Case Study) by identifying the system vulnerabilities to enable its penetration. After compromising the system, critical data (Flags) must be found, indicating our successful penetration. As professional penetration testers, we used an arsenal of penetration testing tools utilised by malicious actors on the internet, such as Nmap, Nessus, Sparta and Metasploit, etc. Typically, much effort was employed on reconnaissance & scanning phases, rather than system exploration, due to their importance in identifying security vulnerabilities in the system environment. The vulnerability analysis highlighted the most critical threats, which token is an advantage to gain access, namely, FTP services, HTTP, and human errors. However, comprising the system is not sufficient because the critical data (Flag) generally requires the administrators rights. Consequently, teams often examine the system to find a way to escalate privilege to the root level. Furthermore, some critical data (Flags) require decryption algorithms or the analysis of captured packets to make them readable. We found eight Flags and identified a system security breach. Mitigation strategies addressing the identified vulnerabilities are recommended to ensure the given networks are secured against future attacks. ",

In order to achieve privacy protection, the variance of the added noise is allowed to be increased, and substantially different from the existing works. In addition, the variance of the added noise can be either decaying or constant. By using time-varying step-sizes based on the stochastic approximation method, we show that the algorithm converges in mean-square and almost-surely even with an increasing privacy noise. We further develop a method to design the step-size and the noise parameter, affording the algorithm to achieve asymptotically unbiased bipartite consensus with the desired accuracy and the predefined differential privacy level. Moreover, we give the mean-square and almost-sure convergence rate of the algorithm, and the privacy level with different forms of the privacy noises.

Moreover, in wireless systems, the frequent transmission of model parameters can cause tremendous bandwidth consumption and network congestion when the model is large. To address this problem, we propose a new FL framework with efficient over-the-air parameter aggregation and strong privacy protection of both user data and models. We achieve this by introducing pairwise cancellable random artificial noises (PCR-ANs) on end devices.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) aims to produce useful feature representations without access to any human-labeled data annotations. Due to the success of recent SSL methods based on contrastive learning, such as SimCLR, this problem has gained popularity. Most current contrastive learning approaches append a parametrized projection head to the end of some backbone network to optimize the InfoNCE objective and then discard the learned projection head after training. This raises a fundamental question: Why is a learnable projection head required if we are to discard it after training? In this work, we first perform a systematic study on the behavior of SSL training focusing on the role of the projection head layers. By formulating the projection head as a parametric component for the InfoNCE objective rather than a part of the network, we present an alternative optimization scheme for training contrastive learning based SSL frameworks. Our experimental study on multiple image classification datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach over alternatives in the SSL literature. ",

    "abstract": "The external visual inspections of rolling stock's underfloor equipment are currently being performed via human visual inspection. In this study, we attempt to partly automate visual inspection by investigating anomaly inspection algorithms that use image processing technology. As the railroad maintenance studies tend to have little anomaly data, unsupervised learning methods are usually preferred for anomaly detection; however, training cost and accuracy is still a challenge. Additionally, a researcher created anomalous images from normal images by adding noise, etc., but the anomalous targeted in this study is the rotation of piping cocks that was difficult to create using noise. Therefore, in this study, we propose a new method that uses style conversion via generative adversarial networks on three-dimensional computer graphics and imitates anomaly images to apply anomaly detection based on supervised learning. The geometry-consistent style conversion model was used to convert the image, and because of this the color and texture of the image were successfully made to imitate the real image while maintaining the anomalous shape. Using the generated anomaly images as supervised data, the anomaly detection model can be easily trained without complex adjustments and successfully detects anomalies. ",

The challenges of crowd counting in highly dense and complex scenes lie in the mutual occlusion of the human body parts, the large variation of the body scales and the complexity of imaging conditions. Deep learning based head detection is a promising method for crowd counting. However the highly concerned object detection networks cannot be well applied to this field for two main reasons. First, most of the existing head detection datasets are only annotated with the center points instead of bounding boxes which is mandatory for the canonical detectors. Second, the sample imbalance has not been overcome yet in highly dense and complex scenes because the existing loss functions calculate the positive loss at a single key point or in the entire target area with the same weight. To address these problems, We propose a novel loss function, called Mask Focal Loss, to unify the loss functions based on heatmap ground truth (GT) and binary feature map GT. Mask Focal Loss redefines the weight of the loss contributions according to the situ value of the heatmap with a Gaussian kernel. For better evaluation and comparison, a new synthetic dataset GTA\\_Head is made public, including 35 sequences, 5096 images and 1732043 head labels with bounding boxes. Experimental results show the overwhelming performance and demonstrate that our proposed Mask Focal Loss is applicable to all of the canonical detectors and to various datasets with different GT. This provides a strong basis for surpassing the crowd counting methods based on density estimation. ",

We benchmark their performance against the off-the-shelf interior-point method Ipopt and against ADMM on infrastructure networks that contain up to 300,000 decision variables and constraints. Overall, we find that the proposed approaches solve problems as fast as Ipopt but with reduced communication. Moreover, we find that the proposed schemes achieve higher accuracy than ADMM approaches.

Different methods have been proposed in the past to identify a set of seed nodes that can help achieve a faster spread of influence in the network. This paper combines driver node selection methods from the field of network control, with the divide-and-conquer approach of using community structure to guide the selection of candidate seed nodes from the driver nodes of the communities. The use of driver nodes in communities as seed nodes is a comparatively new idea. We identify communities of synthetic (i.e., Random, Small-World and Scale-Free) networks as well as twenty-two real-world social networks. Driver nodes from those communities are then ranked according to a range of common centrality measures. We compare the influence spreading power of these seed sets to the results of selecting driver nodes at a global level. We show that in both synthetic and real networks, exploiting community structure enhances the power of the resulting seed sets. ",

Most existing GT tools follow a stateful computational model, where a single graph is repeatedly modified \"in-place\" when GT rules are applied. The implementation of control structures in such tools is not trivial. Common challenges include dealing with the non-determinism inherent to rule application and transactional constraints when executing compositions of GTs, in particular atomicity and isolation. The complexity of associated transaction mechanisms and rule application search algorithms (e.g., backtracking) complicates the definition of a formal foundation for these control structures. Compared to these stateful approaches, functional graph rewriting presents a simpler (stateless) computational model, which simplifies the definition of a formal basis for (functional) GT control structures. In this paper, we propose the \"Graph Transformation control Algebra\" (GTA) as such a foundation.

The assumptions of the most commonly used credit assignment method are disadvantageous in tasks where the effects of decisions are not immediately evident. Furthermore, this method can only evaluate actions that have been selected by the agent, making it highly inefficient. Still, no alternative methods have been widely adopted in the field. Hindsight Credit Assignment is a promising, but still unexplored candidate, which aims to solve the problems of both long-term and counterfactual credit assignment. In this thesis, we empirically investigate Hindsight Credit Assignment to identify its main benefits, and key points to improve. Then, we apply it to factored state representations, and in particular to state representations based on the causal structure of the environment. In this setting, we propose a variant of Hindsight Credit Assignment that effectively exploits a given causal structure. We show that our modification greatly decreases the workload of Hindsight Credit Assignment, making it more efficient and enabling it to outperform the baseline credit assignment method on various tasks. This opens the way to other methods based on given or learned causal structures. ",

As a predictive coding model, it is updated by a combination of bottom-up and top-down information flows, which is different from traditional bottom-up training style. Its advantage is to reduce the dependence on input information and improve its ability to predict and generate images. Importantly, we achieve with a multi-scale approach -- higher level neurons generate coarser predictions (lower resolution), while the lower level generate finer predictions (higher resolution). This is different from the traditional predictive coding framework in which higher level predict the activity of neurons in lower level. To improve the predictive ability, we integrate an encoder-decoder network in the LSTM architecture and share the final encoded high-level semantic information between different levels. Additionally, since the output of each network level is an RGB image, a smaller LSTM hidden state can be used to retain and update the only necessary hidden information, avoiding being mapped to an overly discrete and complex space. In this way, we can reduce the difficulty of prediction and the computational overhead. Finally, we further explore the training strategies, to address the instability in adversarial training and mismatch between training and testing in long-term prediction.

In this paper, we enrich the sequence of accesses solution by applying code vectorization to the monolith, using the \\textit{Code2Vec} neural network model. We apply \\textit{Code2Vec} to vectorize the monolith functionalities. We propose two strategies to represent a functionality, one by aggregating its call graph methods vectors, and the other by extending the sequence of accesses approach with vectorization of the accessed entities. To evaluate these strategies, we compare the proposed strategies with the sequence of accesses strategy and an existing approach that uses class vectorization. We run all these strategies over a large set of codebases, and then compare the results of their decompositions in terms of cohesion, coupling, and complexity. ",

To alleviate this problem, we propose a Dual-Aggregation Transformer Network called DuAT, which is characterized by two innovative designs, namely, the Global-to-Local Spatial Aggregation (GLSA) and Selective Boundary Aggregation (SBA) modules. The GLSA has the ability to aggregate and represent both global and local spatial features, which are beneficial for locating large and small objects, respectively.

Our experiments suggest that CNN-style RevCol models can achieve very competitive performances on multiple computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, especially with large parameter budget and large dataset.

To our knowledge, it is the best COCO detection and ADE20k segmentation result among pure (static) CNN models.

Within FSL, feature pre-training has recently become an increasingly popular strategy to significantly improve generalization performance. However, the contribution of pre-training is often overlooked and understudied, with limited theoretical understanding of its impact on meta-learning performance. Further, pre-training requires a consistent set of global labels shared across training tasks, which may be unavailable in practice. In this work, we address the above issues by first showing the connection between pre-training and meta-learning. We discuss why pre-training yields more robust meta-representation and connect the theoretical analysis to existing works and empirical results. Secondly, we introduce Meta Label Learning (MeLa), a novel meta-learning algorithm that learns task relations by inferring global labels across tasks. This allows us to exploit pre-training for FSL even when global labels are unavailable or ill-defined. Lastly, we introduce an augmented pre-training procedure that further improves the learned meta-representation. Empirically, MeLa outperforms existing methods across a diverse range of benchmarks, in particular under a more challenging setting where the number of training tasks is limited and labels are task-specific. We also provide extensive ablation study to highlight its key properties. ",

    "title": "Aliasing is a Driver of Adversarial Attacks",
    "abstract": "Aliasing is a highly important concept in signal processing, as careful consideration of resolution changes is essential in ensuring transmission and processing quality of audio, image, and video. Despite this, up until recently aliasing has received very little consideration in Deep Learning, with all common architectures carelessly sub-sampling without considering aliasing effects. In this work, we investigate the hypothesis that the existence of adversarial perturbations is due in part to aliasing in neural networks. Our ultimate goal is to increase robustness against adversarial attacks using explainable, non-trained, structural changes only, derived from aliasing first principles. Our contributions are the following. First, we establish a sufficient condition for no aliasing for general image transformations. Next, we study sources of aliasing in common neural network layers, and derive simple modifications from first principles to eliminate or reduce it. Lastly, our experimental results show a solid link between anti-aliasing and adversarial attacks. Simply reducing aliasing already results in more robust classifiers, and combining anti-aliasing with robust training out-performs solo robust training on $L_2$ attacks with none or minimal losses in performance on $L_{\\infty}$ attacks.

    "abstract": "Building management systems tout numerous benefits, such as energy efficiency and occupant comfort but rely on vast amounts of data from various sensors. Advancements in machine learning algorithms make it possible to extract personal information about occupants and their activities beyond the intended design of a non-intrusive sensor. However, occupants are not informed of data collection and possess different privacy preferences and thresholds for privacy loss. While privacy perceptions and preferences are most understood in smart homes, limited studies have evaluated these factors in smart office buildings, where there are more users and different privacy risks. To better understand occupants' perceptions and privacy preferences, we conducted twenty-four semi-structured interviews between April 2022 and May 2022 on occupants of a smart office building. We found that data modality features and personal features contribute to people's privacy preferences. The features of the collected modality define data modality features -- spatial, security, and temporal context. In contrast, personal features consist of one's awareness of data modality features and data inferences, definitions of privacy and security, and the available rewards and utility. Our proposed model of people's privacy preferences in smart office buildings helps design more effective measures to improve people's privacy. ",

    "abstract": "Human motion prediction is a complex task as it involves forecasting variables over time on a graph of connected sensors. This is especially true in the case of few-shot learning, where we strive to forecast motion sequences for previously unseen actions based on only a few examples. Despite this, almost all related approaches for few-shot motion prediction do not incorporate the underlying graph, while it is a common component in classical motion prediction. Furthermore, state-of-the-art methods for few-shot motion prediction are restricted to motion tasks with a fixed output space meaning these tasks are all limited to the same sensor graph. In this work, we propose to extend recent works on few-shot time-series forecasting with heterogeneous attributes with graph neural networks to introduce the first few-shot motion approach that explicitly incorporates the spatial graph while also generalizing across motion tasks with heterogeneous sensors. In our experiments on motion tasks with heterogeneous sensors, we demonstrate significant performance improvements with lifts from 10.4% up to 39.3% compared to best state-of-the-art models. Moreover, we show that our model can perform on par with the best approach so far when evaluating on tasks with a fixed output space while maintaining two magnitudes fewer parameters. ",

    "abstract": "Inter-modal interaction plays an indispensable role in multimodal sentiment analysis. Due to different modalities sequences are usually non-alignment, how to integrate relevant information of each modality to learn fusion representations has been one of the central challenges in multimodal learning. In this paper, a Self-Adjusting Fusion Representation Learning Model (SA-FRLM) is proposed to learn robust crossmodal fusion representations directly from the unaligned text and audio sequences. Different from previous works, our model not only makes full use of the interaction between different modalities but also maximizes the protection of the unimodal characteristics. Specifically, we first employ a crossmodal alignment module to project different modalities features to the same dimension. The crossmodal collaboration attention is then adopted to model the inter-modal interaction between text and audio sequences and initialize the fusion representations. After that, as the core unit of the SA-FRLM, the crossmodal adjustment transformer is proposed to protect original unimodal characteristics. It can dynamically adapt the fusion representations by using single modal streams. We evaluate our approach on the public multimodal sentiment analysis datasets CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI. The experiment results show that our model has significantly improved the performance of all the metrics on the unaligned text-audio sequences. ",

    "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have gained much attention in various fields of engineering thanks to their capability of incorporating physical laws into the models. PINNs integrate the physical constraints by minimizing the partial differential equations (PDEs) residuals on a set of collocation points. The distribution of these collocation points appears to have a huge impact on the performance of PINNs and the assessment of the sampling methods for these points is still an active topic. In this paper, we propose a Fixed-Budget Online Adaptive Mesh Learning (FBOAML) method, which decomposes the domain into sub-domains, for training collocation points based on local maxima and local minima of the PDEs residuals. The stopping criterion is based on a data set of reference, which leads to an adaptive number of iterations for each specific problem. The effectiveness of FBOAML is demonstrated in the context of non-parameterized and parameterized problems. The impact of the hyper-parameters in FBOAML is investigated in this work. The comparison with other adaptive sampling methods is also illustrated. The numerical results demonstrate important gains in terms of accuracy of PINNs with FBOAML over the classical PINNs with non-adaptive collocation points. We also apply FBOAML in a complex industrial application involving coupling between mechanical and thermal fields. We show that FBOAML is able to identify the high-gradient location and even give better prediction for some physical fields than the classical PINNs with collocation points taken on a pre-adapted finite element mesh.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a game-theoretic framework to study the interactions of attack and defense for deep learning-based NextG signal classification. NextG systems such as the one envisioned for a massive number of IoT devices can employ deep neural networks (DNNs) for various tasks such as user equipment identification, physical layer authentication, and detection of incumbent users (such as in the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band). By training another DNN as the surrogate model, an adversary can launch an inference (exploratory) attack to learn the behavior of the victim model, predict successful operation modes (e.g., channel access), and jam them. A defense mechanism can increase the adversary's uncertainty by introducing controlled errors in the victim model's decisions (i.e., poisoning the adversary's training data). This defense is effective against an attack but reduces the performance when there is no attack. The interactions between the defender and the adversary are formulated as a non-cooperative game, where the defender selects the probability of defending or the defense level itself (i.e., the ratio of falsified decisions) and the adversary selects the probability of attacking. The defender's objective is to maximize its reward (e.g., throughput or transmission success ratio), whereas the adversary's objective is to minimize this reward and its attack cost. The Nash equilibrium strategies are determined as operation modes such that no player can unilaterally improve its utility given the other's strategy is fixed. A fictitious play is formulated for each player to play the game repeatedly in response to the empirical frequency of the opponent's actions. The performance in Nash equilibrium is compared to the fixed attack and defense cases, and the resilience of NextG signal classification against attacks is quantified. ",

In this work, we employ an Interval Arithmetic (IA) model to develop an exploration methodology that takes advantage of the capability of such a model to propagate the approximation error to detect when the approximation exceeds tolerable limits by the application. Experimental results confirm the capability of reducing the exploration time significantly, providing the chance to reduce the network parameters' size further and with more fine-grained results. ",

In order to maintain good accuracy, these components are frequently run using full-precision floating-point computation, making them slow, inefficient and difficult to deploy on edge devices. In addition, the complex nature of these operations makes them challenging to quantize using standard quantization methods without a significant performance drop. We present a quantization-aware training method for obtaining a highly accurate integer-only recurrent neural network (iRNN). Our approach supports layer normalization, attention, and an adaptive piecewise linear (PWL) approximation of activation functions, to serve a wide range of state-of-the-art RNNs. The proposed method enables RNN-based language models to run on edge devices with $2\\times$ improvement in runtime, and $4\\times$ reduction in model size while maintaining similar accuracy as its full-precision counterpart.

These attacks heavily depend on the attacker's knowledge of the application domain, e.g., using it to determine the auxiliary data for model-inversion attacks. However, attackers may not know what the model is used for in practice. We propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based method to explore likely or similar domains of a target model -- the model domain inference (MDI) attack. For a given target (classification) model, we assume that the attacker knows nothing but the input and output formats and can use the model to derive the prediction for any input in the desired form. Our basic idea is to use the target model to affect a GAN training process for a candidate domain's dataset that is easy to obtain. We find that the target model may distract the training procedure less if the domain is more similar to the target domain. We then measure the distraction level with the distance between GAN-generated datasets, which can be used to rank candidate domains for the target model. Our experiments show that the auxiliary dataset from an MDI top-ranked domain can effectively boost the result of model-inversion attacks. ",

In contrast, by incorporating a knowledge base and connecting entities with their locations, our system successfully infers the relevant locations even when they are not mentioned explicitly in the text.

However, original KGs employed in existing CRSs are often incomplete and sparse, which limits the reasoning capability in recommendation. Moreover, only few of existing studies exploit the dialogue context to dynamically refine knowledge from KGs for better recommendation. To address the above issues, we propose the Variational Reasoning over Incomplete KGs Conversational Recommender (VRICR). Our key idea is to incorporate the large dialogue corpus naturally accompanied with CRSs to enhance the incomplete KGs; and perform dynamic knowledge reasoning conditioned on the dialogue context. Specifically, we denote the dialogue-specific subgraphs of KGs as latent variables with categorical priors for adaptive knowledge graphs refactor. We propose a variational Bayesian method to approximate posterior distributions over dialogue-specific subgraphs, which not only leverages the dialogue corpus for restructuring missing entity relations but also dynamically selects knowledge based on the dialogue context. Finally, we infuse the dialogue-specific subgraphs to decode the recommendation and responses. We conduct experiments on two benchmark CRSs datasets.

Therefore, optical networks need to evolve towards an efficient exploitation of the infrastructure by overcoming the closed and aggregated paradigm, to enable apparatus sharing together with the slicing and separation of the optical data plane from the optical control. In addition to the advantages in terms of efficiency and cost reduction, this evolution will increase the network reliability, also allowing for a fine trade-off between robustness and maximum capacity exploitation. In this work, an optical network architecture is presented based on the physical layer digital twin of the optical transport used within a multi-layer hierarchical control operated by an intent-based network operating system. An experimental proof of concept is performed on a three node network including up to 1000 km optical transmission, open re-configurable optical add & drop multiplexers (ROADMs) and white-box transponders hosting pluggable multi-rate transceivers. The proposed solution is based on GNPy as optical physical layer digital twin and ONOS as intent-based network operating system. The reliability of the optical control decoupled by the data plane functioning is experimentally demonstrated exploiting GNPy as open lightpath computation engine and software optical amplifier models derived from the component characterization. Besides the lightpath deployment exploiting the modulation format evaluation given a generic traffic request, the architecture reliability is tested mimicking the use case of an automatic failure recovery from a fiber cut.

The goal of this paper is to introduce the concept and explore the strengths and weaknesses of BPINNs compared to existing methods. We compare BPINNs with the PINNs and the recently popular method for system identification, SINDy.

Knee OA is not a curable disease yet, and it affects large columns of patients, making it costly to patients and healthcare systems. Etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of knee OA might be argued by variability in its clinical and physical manifestations. Although knee OA carries a list of well-known terminology aiming to standardize the nomenclature of the diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and clinical outcomes of the chronic joint disease, in practice there is a wide range of terminology associated with knee OA across different data sources, including but not limited to biomedical literature, clinical notes, healthcare literacy, and health-related social media. Among these data sources, the scientific articles published in the biomedical literature usually make a principled pipeline to study disease. Rapid yet, accurate text mining on large-scale scientific literature may discover novel knowledge and terminology to better understand knee OA and to improve the quality of knee OA diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The present works aim to utilize artificial neural network strategies to automatically extract vocabularies associated with knee OA diseases.

    "abstract": "Streaming graph processing involves performing updates and analytics on a time-evolving graph. The underlying representation format largely determines the throughputs of these updates and analytics phases. Existing formats usually employ variations of hash tables or adjacency lists. However, adjacency-list-based approaches perform poorly on heavy-tailed graphs, and the hash-based approaches suffer on short-tailed graphs. We propose GraphTango, a hybrid format that provides excellent update and analytics throughput regardless of the graph's degree distribution. GraphTango switches among three different formats based on a vertex's degree: i) Low-degree vertices store the edges directly with the neighborhood metadata, confining accesses to a single cache line, ii) Medium-degree vertices use adjacency lists, and iii) High-degree vertices use hash tables as well as adjacency lists. In this case, adjacency list provides fast traversal during the analytics phase, while the hash table provides constant-time lookups during the update phase. We further optimized the performance by designing an open-addressing-based hash table that fully utilizes every fetched cache line. In addition, we developed a thread-local lock-free memory pool that allows fast growing/shrinking of the adjacency lists and hash tables in a multi-threaded environment. We evaluated GraphTango with the help of the SAGA-Bench framework and compared it with four other representation formats. On average, GraphTango provides 4.5x higher insertion throughput, 3.2x higher deletion throughput, and 1.1x higher analytics throughput over the next best format. Furthermore, we integrated GraphTango with the state-of-the-art graph processing frameworks DZiG and RisGraph. Compared to the vanilla DZiG and vanilla RisGraph, [GraphTango + DZiG] and [GraphTango + RisGraph] reduces the average batch processing time by 2.3x and 1.5x, respectively. ",

    "title": "Bridge Girth: A Unifying Notion in Network Design",
    "abstract": "A classic 1993 paper by Alth\\H{o}fer et al. proved a tight reduction from spanners, emulators, and distance oracles to the extremal function $\\gamma$ of high-girth graphs. This paper initiated a large body of work in network design, in which problems are attacked by reduction to $\\gamma$ or the analogous extremal function for other girth concepts. In this paper, we introduce and study a new girth concept that we call the bridge girth of path systems, and we show that it can be used to significantly expand and improve this web of connections between girth problems and network design. We prove two kinds of results: 1) We write the maximum possible size of an $n$-node, $p$-path system with bridge girth $>k$ as $\\beta(n, p, k)$, and we write a certain variant for \"ordered\" path systems as $\\beta^*(n, p, k)$. We identify several arguments in the literature that implicitly show upper or lower bounds on $\\beta, \\beta^*$, and we provide some polynomially improvements to these bounds. In particular, we construct a tight lower bound for $\\beta(n, p, 2)$, and we polynomially improve the upper bounds for $\\beta(n, p, 4)$ and $\\beta^*(n, p, \\infty)$. 2) We show that many state-of-the-art results in network design can be recovered or improved via black-box reductions to $\\beta$ or $\\beta^*$. Examples include bounds for distance/reachability preservers, exact hopsets, shortcut sets, the flow-cut gaps for directed multicut and sparsest cut, an integrality gap for directed Steiner forest. We believe that the concept of bridge girth can lead to a stronger and more organized map of the research area. Towards this, we leave many open problems, related to both bridge girth reductions and extremal bounds on the size of path systems with high bridge girth. ",

Before sharing a NeRF, though, it might be desirable to remove personal information or unsightly objects. Such removal is not easily achieved with the current NeRF editing frameworks. We propose a framework to remove objects from a NeRF representation created from an RGB-D sequence. Our NeRF inpainting method leverages recent work in 2D image inpainting and is guided by a user-provided mask. Our algorithm is underpinned by a confidence based view selection procedure. It chooses which of the individual 2D inpainted images to use in the creation of the NeRF, so that the resulting inpainted NeRF is 3D consistent. We show that our method for NeRF editing is effective for synthesizing plausible inpaintings in a multi-view coherent manner. We validate our approach using a new and still-challenging dataset for the task of NeRF inpainting. ",

The minimum edge convex $L_p$-norm network for $1<p<\\infty$ is obtained from the solution to a system of nonlinear equations with coefficients determined by the data. The solution in the case $1<p<\\infty$ is unique for strictly convex data. The corresponding extremal problem for $p=\\infty$ remained open. Here we show that the extremal interpolation problem for $p=\\infty$ always has a solution. We give a characterization of this solution.

    "abstract": "Quantum many-body problems are some of the most challenging problems in science and are central to demystifying some exotic quantum phenomena, e.g., high-temperature superconductors. The combination of neural networks (NN) for representing quantum states, coupled with the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) algorithm, has been shown to be a promising method for solving such problems. However, the run-time of this approach scales quadratically with the number of simulated particles, constraining the practically usable NN to - in machine learning terms - minuscule sizes (<10M parameters). Considering the many breakthroughs brought by extreme NN in the +1B parameters scale to other domains, lifting this constraint could significantly expand the set of quantum systems we can accurately simulate on classical computers, both in size and complexity. We propose a NN architecture called Vector-Quantized Neural Quantum States (VQ-NQS) that utilizes vector-quantization techniques to leverage redundancies in the local-energy calculations of the VMC algorithm - the source of the quadratic scaling. In our preliminary experiments, we demonstrate VQ-NQS ability to reproduce the ground state of the 2D Heisenberg model across various system sizes, while reporting a significant reduction of about ${\\times}10$ in the number of FLOPs in the local-energy calculation.

While powerful, existing tensor RPCA algorithms can be difficult to use in practice, as their performance can be sensitive to the choice of additional hyperparameters, which are not straightforward to tune. In this paper, we describe a fast and simple self-supervised model for tensor RPCA using deep unfolding by only learning four hyperparameters. Despite its simplicity, our model expunges the need for ground truth labels while maintaining competitive or even greater performance compared to supervised deep unfolding. Furthermore, our model is capable of operating in extreme data-starved scenarios. We demonstrate these claims on a mix of synthetic data and real-world tasks, comparing performance against previously studied supervised deep unfolding methods and Bayesian optimization baselines. ",

GCS-Q starts by considering the grand coalition as initial coalition structure and proceeds by iteratively splitting the coalitions into two nonempty subsets to obtain a coalition structure with a higher coalition value. In particular, given an $n$-agent ISG, the GCS-Q solves the optimal split problem $\\mathcal{O} (n)$ times using a quantum annealing device, exploring $\\mathcal{O}(2^n)$ partitions at each step. We show that GCS-Q outperforms the currently best classical solvers with its runtime in the order of $n^2$ and an expected worst-case approximation ratio of $93\\%$ on standard benchmark datasets. ",

This paper proposes to unify these subjects and study Generalized Speech Enhancement, where the goal is not to reconstruct the exact reference clean signal, but to focus on improving certain aspects of speech. In particular, this paper concerns intelligibility, quality, and video synchronization. We cast the problem as audio-visual speech resynthesis, which is composed of two steps: pseudo audio-visual speech recognition (P-AVSR) and pseudo text-to-speech synthesis (P-TTS). P-AVSR and P-TTS are connected by discrete units derived from a self-supervised speech model. Moreover, we utilize self-supervised audio-visual speech model to initialize P-AVSR. The proposed model is coined ReVISE. ReVISE is the first high-quality model for in-the-wild video-to-speech synthesis and achieves superior performance on all LRS3 audio-visual enhancement tasks with a single model. To demonstrates its applicability in the real world, ReVISE is also evaluated on EasyCom, an audio-visual benchmark collected under challenging acoustic conditions with only 1.6 hours of training data. Similarly, ReVISE greatly suppresses noise and improves quality. Project page: https://wnhsu.github.io/ReVISE. ",

A subclass of QML methods is quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) which have been studied as a quantum counterpart of classical GANs widely used in image manipulation and generation tasks. The existing work on QGANs is still limited to small-scale proof-of-concept examples based on images with significant down-scaling. Here we integrate classical and quantum techniques to propose a new hybrid quantum-classical GAN framework. We demonstrate its superior learning capabilities by generating $28 \\times 28$ pixels grey-scale images without dimensionality reduction or classical pre/post-processing on multiple classes of the standard MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, which achieves comparable results to classical frameworks with 3 orders of magnitude less trainable generator parameters. To gain further insight into the working of our hybrid approach, we systematically explore the impact of its parameter space by varying the number of qubits, the size of image patches, the number of layers in the generator, the shape of the patches and the choice of prior distribution. Our results show that increasing the quantum generator size generally improves the learning capability of the network. The developed framework provides a foundation for future design of QGANs with optimal parameter set tailored for complex image generation tasks. ",

    "abstract": "Retrosynthesis is the task of breaking down a chemical compound recursively step-by-step into molecular precursors until a set of commercially available molecules is found. Consequently, the goal is to provide a valid synthesis route for a molecule. As more single-step models develop, we see increasing accuracy in the prediction of molecular disconnections, potentially improving the creation of synthetic paths. Multi-step approaches repeatedly apply the chemical information stored in single-step retrosynthesis models. However, this connection is not reflected in contemporary research, fixing either the single-step model or the multi-step algorithm in the process. In this work, we establish a bridge between both tasks by benchmarking the performance and transfer of different single-step retrosynthesis models to the multi-step domain by leveraging two common search algorithms, Monte Carlo Tree Search and Retro*. We show that models designed for single-step retrosynthesis, when extended to multi-step, can have a tremendous impact on the route finding capabilities of current multi-step methods, improving performance by up to +30% compared to the most widely used model. Furthermore, we observe no clear link between contemporary single-step and multi-step evaluation metrics, showing that single-step models need to be developed and tested for the multi-step domain and not as an isolated task to find synthesis routes for molecules of interest.

A key issue is how to address the inherent non-linearity of classical deep learning, a problem in the quantum domain due to the fact that the composition of an arbitrary number of quantum gates, consisting of a series of sequential unitary transformations, is intrinsically linear. This problem has been variously approached in the literature, principally via the introduction of measurements between layers of unitary transformations. In this paper, we introduce the Quantum Path Kernel, a formulation of quantum machine learning capable of replicating those aspects of deep machine learning typically associated with superior generalization performance in the classical domain, specifically, hierarchical feature learning. Our approach generalizes the notion of Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel, which has been used to study the dynamics of classical and quantum machine learning models. The Quantum Path Kernel exploits the parameter trajectory, i.e. the curve delineated by model parameters as they evolve during training, enabling the representation of differential layer-wise convergence behaviors, or the formation of hierarchical parametric dependencies, in terms of their manifestation in the gradient space of the predictor function. We evaluate our approach with respect to variants of the classification of Gaussian XOR mixtures - an artificial but emblematic problem that intrinsically requires multilevel learning in order to achieve optimal class separation.

Despite its low contrast and variety in nodal size and form, LN segmentation remains a challenging task. Deep convolutional neural networks frequently segment items in medical photographs. Most state-of-the-art techniques destroy image's resolution through pooling and convolution. As a result, the models provide unsatisfactory results. Keeping the issues in mind, a well-established deep learning technique UNet was modified using bilinear interpolation and total generalized variation (TGV) based upsampling strategy to segment and detect mediastinal lymph nodes. The modified UNet maintains texture discontinuities, selects noisy areas, searches appropriate balance points through backpropagation, and recreates image resolution. Collecting CT image data from TCIA, 5-patients, and ELCAP public dataset, a dataset was prepared with the help of experienced medical experts. The UNet was trained using those datasets, and three different data combinations were utilized for testing. Utilizing the proposed approach, the model achieved 94.8% accuracy, 91.9% Jaccard, 94.1% recall, and 93.1% precision on COMBO_3.
