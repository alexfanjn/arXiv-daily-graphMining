    "title": "Intelligent Feature Extraction, Data Fusion and Detection of Concrete  Bridge Cracks: Current Development and Challenges",
    "abstract": "As a common appearance defect of concrete bridges, cracks are important indices for bridge structure health assessment. Although there has been much research on crack identification, research on the evolution mechanism of bridge cracks is still far from practical applications. In this paper, the state-of-the-art research on intelligent theories and methodologies for intelligent feature extraction, data fusion and crack detection based on data-driven approaches is comprehensively reviewed. The research is discussed from three aspects: the feature extraction level of the multimodal parameters of bridge cracks, the description level and the diagnosis level of the bridge crack damage states. We focus on previous research concerning the quantitative characterization problems of multimodal parameters of bridge cracks and their implementation in crack identification, while highlighting some of their major drawbacks. In addition, the current challenges and potential future research directions are discussed. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in the field of graph representation learning. Standard GNNs define a local message-passing mechanism which propagates information over the whole graph domain by stacking multiple layers. This paradigm suffers from two major limitations, over-squashing and poor long-range dependencies, that can be solved using global attention but significantly increases the computational cost to quadratic complexity. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to overcome these structural limitations by leveraging the ViT/MLP-Mixer architectures introduced in computer vision. We introduce a new class of GNNs, called Graph MLP-Mixer, that holds three key properties. First, they capture long-range dependency and mitigate the issue of over-squashing as demonstrated on the Long Range Graph Benchmark (LRGB) and the TreeNeighbourMatch datasets. Second, they offer better speed and memory efficiency with a complexity linear to the number of nodes and edges, surpassing the related Graph Transformer and expressive GNN models. Third, they show high expressivity in terms of graph isomorphism as they can distinguish at least 3-WL non-isomorphic graphs. We test our architecture on 4 simulated datasets and 7 real-world benchmarks, and show highly competitive results on all of them. ",

    "abstract": "Configurable software systems are employed in many important application domains. Understanding the performance of the systems under all configurations is critical to prevent potential performance issues caused by misconfiguration. However, as the number of configurations can be prohibitively large, it is not possible to measure the system performance under all configurations. Thus, a common approach is to build a prediction model from a limited measurement data to predict the performance of all configurations as scalar values. However, it has been pointed out that there are different sources of uncertainty coming from the data collection or the modeling process, which can make the scalar predictions not certainly accurate. To address this problem, we propose a Bayesian deep learning based method, namely BDLPerf, that can incorporate uncertainty into the prediction model. BDLPerf can provide both scalar predictions for configurations' performance and the corresponding confidence intervals of these scalar predictions. We also develop a novel uncertainty calibration technique to ensure the reliability of the confidence intervals generated by a Bayesian prediction model. Finally, we suggest an efficient hyperparameter tuning technique so as to train the prediction model within a reasonable amount of time whilst achieving high accuracy. Our experimental results on 10 real-world systems show that BDLPerf achieves higher accuracy than existing approaches, in both scalar performance prediction and confidence interval estimation. ",

    "title": "HCB: Enabling Compact Block in Ethereum Network with Secondary Pool and  Transaction Prediction",
    "abstract": "Compact block, which replaces transactions in the block with their hashes, is an effective means to speed up block propagation in the Bitcoin network. The compact block mechanism in Bitcoin counts on the fact that many nodes may already have the transactions (or most of the transactions) in the block, therefore sending the complete block containing the full transactions is unnecessary. This fact, however, does not hold in the Ethereum network. Adopting compact block directly in Ethereum may degrade the block propagation speed significantly because the probability of a node not having a transaction in the sending block is relatively high in Ethereum and requesting the missing transactions after receiving the compact block takes much additional time. This paper proposes hybrid-compact block (HCB), an efficient compact block propagation scheme for Ethereum and other similar blockchains. First, we develop a Secondary Pool to store the low-fee transactions, which are removed from the primary transaction pool, to conserve storage space. As simple auxiliary storage, the Secondary Pool does not affect the normal block processing of the primary pool in Ethereum. Second, we design a machine learning-based transaction prediction module to precisely predict the missing transactions caused by network latency and selfish behaviors. We implemented our HCB scheme and other compact-block-like schemes (as benchmarks) and deployed a number of worldwide nodes over the Ethereum MainNet to experimentally investigate them. Experimental results show that HCB performs best among the existing compact-block-like schemes and can reduce propagation time by more than half with respect to the current block propagation scheme in Ethereum.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on a wireless-powered sensor network coordinated by a multi-antenna access point (AP). Each node can generate sensing information and report the latest information to the AP using the energy harvested from the AP's signal beamforming. We aim to minimize the average age-of-information (AoI) by adapting the nodes' transmission scheduling and the transmission control strategies jointly. To reduce the transmission delay, an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is used to enhance the channel conditions by controlling the AP's beamforming vector and the IRS's phase shifting matrix. Considering dynamic data arrivals at different sensing nodes, we propose a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to for AoI minimization in two steps. The users' transmission scheduling is firstly determined by the outer-loop DRL approach, e.g. the DQN or PPO algorithm, and then the inner-loop optimization is used to adapt either the uplink information transmission or downlink energy transfer to all nodes. A simple and efficient approximation is also proposed to reduce the inner-loop rum time overhead. Numerical results verify that the hierarchical learning framework outperforms typical baselines in terms of the average AoI and proportional fairness among different nodes. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we employ multiple UAVs coordinated by a base station (BS) to help the ground users (GUs) to offload their sensing data. Different UAVs can adapt their trajectories and network formation to expedite data transmissions via multi-hop relaying. The trajectory planning aims to collect all GUs' data, while the UAVs' network formation optimizes the multi-hop UAV network topology to minimize the energy consumption and transmission delay. The joint network formation and trajectory optimization is solved by a two-step iterative approach. Firstly, we devise the adaptive network formation scheme by using a heuristic algorithm to balance the UAVs' energy consumption and data queue size. Then, with the fixed network formation, the UAVs' trajectories are further optimized by using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning without knowing the GUs' traffic demands and spatial distribution. To improve the learning efficiency, we further employ Bayesian optimization to estimate the UAVs' flying decisions based on historical trajectory points. This helps avoid inefficient action explorations and improves the convergence rate in the model training. The simulation results reveal close spatial-temporal couplings between the UAVs' trajectory planning and network formation. Compared with several baselines, our solution can better exploit the UAVs' cooperation in data offloading, thus improving energy efficiency and delay performance. ",

Additionally, we demonstrate an instantiation of the GEDI framework by integrating an energy-based model with a cluster-based self-supervised learning model. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, including SVHN, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, we show that GEDI outperforms existing self-supervised learning strategies in terms of clustering performance by a wide margin. We also demonstrate that GEDI can be integrated into a neural-symbolic framework to address tasks in the small data regime, where it can use logical constraints to further improve clustering and classification performance.

    "abstract": "The future of population-based breast cancer screening is likely personalized strategies based on clinically relevant risk models. Mammography-based risk models should remain robust to domain shifts caused by different populations and mammographic devices. Modern risk models do not ensure adaptation across vendor-domains and are often conflated to unintentionally rely on both precursors of cancer and systemic/global mammographic information associated with short- and long-term risk, respectively, which might limit performance. We developed a robust, cross-vendor model for long-term risk assessment. An augmentation-based domain adaption technique, based on flavorization of mammographic views, ensured generalization to an unseen vendor-domain. We trained on samples without diagnosed/potential malignant findings to learn systemic/global breast tissue features, called mammographic texture, indicative of future breast cancer. However, training so may cause erratic convergence. By excluding noise-inducing samples and designing a case-control dataset, a robust ensemble texture model was trained. This model was validated in two independent datasets. In 66,607 Danish women with flavorized Siemens views, the AUC was 0.71 and 0.65 for prediction of interval cancers within two years (ICs) and from two years after screening (LTCs), respectively. In a combination with established risk factors, the model's AUC increased to 0.68 for LTCs. In 25,706 Dutch women with Hologic-processed views, the AUCs were not different from the AUCs in Danish women with flavorized views. The results suggested that the model robustly estimated long-term risk while adapting to an unseen processed vendor-domain. The model identified 8.1% of Danish women accounting for 20.9% of ICs and 14.2% of LTCs. ",

Specifically, we first separate the fingerprints and contents of the GAN-generated images using an autoencoder based GAN fingerprint extractor, followed by random perturbations of the fingerprints. Then the original fingerprints are substituted with the perturbed fingerprints and added to the original contents, to produce images that are visually invariant but with distinct fingerprints. The perturbed images can successfully imitate images generated by different GANs to improve the generalization of the detectors, which is demonstrated by the spectra visualization. To our knowledge, we are the first to conduct data augmentation in the fingerprint domain. Our work explores a novel prospect that is distinct from previous works on spatial and frequency domain augmentation. Extensive cross-GAN experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods in detecting fake images generated by unknown GANs. ",

Inspired by coordinate inputs of previous neural representation methods, we assign a coordinate to each convolutional kernel in our network based on its position in the architecture, and optimize a predictor network to map coordinates to their corresponding weights. Similarly to the spatial smoothness of visual scenes, we show that incorporating a smoothness constraint over the original network's weights aids NeRN towards a better reconstruction. In addition, since slight perturbations in pre-trained model weights can result in a considerable accuracy loss, we employ techniques from the field of knowledge distillation to stabilize the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NeRN in reconstructing widely used architectures on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection on time series data is increasingly common across various industrial domains that monitor metrics in order to prevent potential accidents and economic losses. However, a scarcity of labeled data and ambiguous definitions of anomalies can complicate these efforts. Recent unsupervised machine learning methods have made remarkable progress in tackling this problem using either single-timestamp predictions or time series reconstructions. While traditionally considered separately, these methods are not mutually exclusive and can offer complementary perspectives on anomaly detection. This paper first highlights the successes and limitations of prediction-based and reconstruction-based methods with visualized time series signals and anomaly scores. We then propose AER (Auto-encoder with Regression), a joint model that combines a vanilla auto-encoder and an LSTM regressor to incorporate the successes and address the limitations of each method. Our model can produce bi-directional predictions while simultaneously reconstructing the original time series by optimizing a joint objective function. Furthermore, we propose several ways of combining the prediction and reconstruction errors through a series of ablation studies. Finally, we compare the performance of the AER architecture against two prediction-based methods and three reconstruction-based methods on 12 well-known univariate time series datasets from NASA, Yahoo, Numenta, and UCR. The results show that AER has the highest averaged F1 score across all datasets (a 23.5% improvement compared to ARIMA) while retaining a runtime similar to its vanilla auto-encoder and regressor components. Our model is available in Orion, an open-source benchmarking tool for time series anomaly detection. ",

Experiments demonstrate that the proposed SEC-CGAN outperforms the external classifier GAN (EC-GAN) and a baseline ResNet-18 classifier.

    "abstract": "Spectrum coexistence is essential for next generation (NextG) systems to share the spectrum with incumbent (primary) users and meet the growing demand for bandwidth. One example is the 3.5 GHz Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band, where the 5G and beyond communication systems need to sense the spectrum and then access the channel in an opportunistic manner when the incumbent user (e.g., radar) is not transmitting. To that end, a high-fidelity classifier based on a deep neural network is needed for low misdetection (to protect incumbent users) and low false alarm (to achieve high throughput for NextG). In a dynamic wireless environment, the classifier can only be used for a limited period of time, i.e., coherence time. A portion of this period is used for learning to collect sensing results and train a classifier, and the rest is used for transmissions. In spectrum sharing systems, there is a well-known tradeoff between the sensing time and the transmission time. While increasing the sensing time can increase the spectrum sensing accuracy, there is less time left for data transmissions. In this paper, we present a generative adversarial network (GAN) approach to generate synthetic sensing results to augment the training data for the deep learning classifier so that the sensing time can be reduced (and thus the transmission time can be increased) while keeping high accuracy of the classifier. We consider both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh channels, and show that this GAN-based approach can significantly improve both the protection of the high-priority user and the throughput of the NextG user (more in Rayleigh channels than AWGN channels).

YOLO is famous for its object recognition properties. You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a popular algorithm that has gone viral. YOLO is well known for its ability to identify objects. YOLO V2, V3, V4, and V5 are some of the YOLO latest versions that experts have published in recent years. Early brain tumor detection is one of the most important jobs that neurologists and radiologists have. However, it can be difficult and error-prone to manually identify and segment brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. For making an early diagnosis of the condition, an automated brain tumor detection system is necessary. The model of the research paper has three classes. They are respectively Meningioma, Pituitary, Glioma. The results show that, our model achieves competitive accuracy, in terms of runtime usage of M2 10 core GPU. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to different tasks such as bioinformatics, drug design, and social networks. However, recent studies have shown that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks which aim to mislead the node or subgraph classification prediction by adding subtle perturbations. Detecting these attacks is challenging due to the small magnitude of perturbation and the discrete nature of graph data. In this paper, we propose a general adversarial edge detection pipeline EDoG without requiring knowledge of the attack strategies based on graph generation. Specifically, we propose a novel graph generation approach combined with link prediction to detect suspicious adversarial edges. To effectively train the graph generative model, we sample several sub-graphs from the given graph data. We show that since the number of adversarial edges is usually low in practice, with low probability the sampled sub-graphs will contain adversarial edges based on the union bound. In addition, considering the strong attacks which perturb a large number of edges, we propose a set of novel features to perform outlier detection as the preprocessing for our detection. Extensive experimental results on three real-world graph datasets including a private transaction rule dataset from a major company and two types of synthetic graphs with controlled properties show that EDoG can achieve above 0.8 AUC against four state-of-the-art unseen attack strategies without requiring any knowledge about the attack type; and around 0.85 with knowledge of the attack type. EDoG significantly outperforms traditional malicious edge detection baselines. We also show that an adaptive attack with full knowledge of our detection pipeline is difficult to bypass it. ",

    "abstract": "The efforts to replace the successful, albeit aging, TCP/IP Internet architecture with a better suited one have driving research interest to information-centric alternatives. The Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture is probably one of the main contenders to become the network layer of the future Internet thanks to its inbuilt support for mobility, in-network caching, security and, in general, for being better adapted to the needs of current network applications. At the same time, massive satellite constellations are currently being deployed in low Earth orbits (LEO) to provide a backend for network connectivity. It is expected that, very soon, these constellations will function as proper networks thanks to inter-satellite communication links. These new satellite networks will be able to benefit from their greenfield status and the new network architectures. In this paper we analyze how to deploy the network caches of an NDN-based LEO satellite network. In particular, we show how we can jointly select the most appropriate caching nodes for each piece of content and how to forward data across the constellation in two simple alternative ways. Performance results show that the caching and forwarding strategies proposed reduce path lengths up to a third with just a few caching nodes while, simultaneously, helping to spread the load along the network.

    "abstract": "Support Vector Machines have been successfully used for one-class classification (OCSVM, SVDD) when trained on clean data, but they work much worse on dirty data: outliers present in the training data tend to become support vectors, and are hence considered \"normal\". In this article, we improve the effectiveness to detect outliers in dirty training data with a leave-out strategy: by temporarily omitting one candidate at a time, this point can be judged using the remaining data only. We show that this is more effective at scoring the outlierness of points than using the slack term of existing SVM-based approaches. Identified outliers can then be removed from the data, such that outliers hidden by other outliers can be identified, to reduce the problem of masking. Naively, this approach would require training N individual SVMs (and training $O(N^2)$ SVMs when iteratively removing the worst outliers one at a time), which is prohibitively expensive. We will discuss that only support vectors need to be considered in each step and that by reusing SVM parameters and weights, this incremental retraining can be accelerated substantially. By removing candidates in batches, we can further improve the processing time, although it obviously remains more costly than training a single SVM. ",

We estimate precise null effects of showing users warning flags or suggesting related articles alongside misleading posts, tactics used by social media platforms. Instead, users share more discerningly when they are given tips for spotting misinformation or are nudged to consider information's accuracy, reducing misinformation sharing by 7.5% and 4.5% relative to control, respectively.

    "abstract": "The paradigm of big data is characterized by the need to collect and process data sets of great volume, arriving at the systems with great velocity, in a variety of formats. Spark is a widely used big data processing system that can be integrated with Hadoop to provide powerful abstractions to developers, such as distributed storage through HDFS and resource management through YARN. When all the required configurations are made, Spark can also provide quality attributes, such as scalability, fault tolerance, and security. However, all of these benefits come at the cost of complexity, with high memory requirements, and additional latency in processing. An alternative approach is to use a lean software stack, like Unicage, that delegates most control back to the developer. In this work we evaluated the performance of big data processing with Spark versus Unicage, in a cluster environment hosted in the IBM Cloud. Two sets of experiments were performed: batch processing of unstructured data sets, and query processing of structured data sets. The input data sets were of significant size, ranging from 64 GB to 8192 GB in volume. The results show that the performance of Unicage scripts is superior to Spark for search workloads like grep and select, but that the abstractions of distributed storage and resource management from the Hadoop stack enable Spark to execute workloads with inter-record dependencies, such as sort and join, with correct outputs.

    "abstract": "The task of reconstructing 3D human motion has wideranging applications. The gold standard Motion capture (MoCap) systems are accurate but inaccessible to the general public due to their cost, hardware and space constraints. In contrast, monocular human mesh recovery (HMR) methods are much more accessible than MoCap as they take single-view videos as inputs. Replacing the multi-view Mo- Cap systems with a monocular HMR method would break the current barriers to collecting accurate 3D motion thus making exciting applications like motion analysis and motiondriven animation accessible to the general public. However, performance of existing HMR methods degrade when the video contains challenging and dynamic motion that is not in existing MoCap datasets used for training. This reduces its appeal as dynamic motion is frequently the target in 3D motion recovery in the aforementioned applications. Our study aims to bridge the gap between monocular HMR and multi-view MoCap systems by leveraging information shared across multiple video instances of the same action. We introduce the Neural Motion (NeMo) field. It is optimized to represent the underlying 3D motions across a set of videos of the same action. Empirically, we show that NeMo can recover 3D motion in sports using videos from the Penn Action dataset, where NeMo outperforms existing HMR methods in terms of 2D keypoint detection. To further validate NeMo using 3D metrics, we collected a small MoCap dataset mimicking actions in Penn Action,and show that NeMo achieves better 3D reconstruction compared to various baselines. ",

    "abstract": "The deep neural network (DNN) models for object detection using camera images are widely adopted in autonomous vehicles. However, DNN models are shown to be susceptible to adversarial image perturbations. In the existing methods of generating the adversarial image perturbations, optimizations take each incoming image frame as the decision variable to generate an image perturbation. Therefore, given a new image, the typically computationally-expensive optimization needs to start over as there is no learning between the independent optimizations. Very few approaches have been developed for attacking online image streams while considering the underlying physical dynamics of autonomous vehicles, their mission, and the environment. We propose a multi-level stochastic optimization framework that monitors an attacker's capability of generating the adversarial perturbations. Based on this capability level, a binary decision attack/not attack is introduced to enhance the effectiveness of the attacker. We evaluate our proposed multi-level image attack framework using simulations for vision-guided autonomous vehicles and actual tests with a small indoor drone in an office environment. The results show our method's capability to generate the image attack in real-time while monitoring when the attacker is proficient given state estimates. ",

    "abstract": "When facing objects/files of differing sizes in content delivery networks (CDNs) caches, pursuing an optimal object miss ratio (OMR) by approximating Belady no longer ensures an optimal byte miss ratio (BMR), creating confusion about how to achieve a superior BMR in CDNs. To address this issue, we experimentally observe that there exists a time window to delay the eviction of the object with the longest reuse distance to improve BMR without increasing OMR. As a result, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (RL) model to capture this time window by dynamically monitoring the changes in OMR and BMR, and implementing a BMR-friendly policy in the time window. Based on this policy, we propose a Belady and Size Eviction (LRU-BaSE) algorithm, reducing BMR while maintaining OMR. To make LRU-BaSE efficient and practical, we address the feedback delay problem of RL with a two-pronged approach. On the one hand, our observation of a rear section of the LRU cache queue containing most of the eviction candidates allows LRU-BaSE to shorten the decision region. On the other hand, the request distribution on CDNs makes it feasible to divide the learning region into multiple sub-regions that are each learned with reduced time and increased accuracy. In real CDN systems, compared to LRU, LRU-BaSE can reduce \"backing to OS\" traffic and access latency by 30.05\\% and 17.07\\%, respectively, on average. The results on the simulator confirm that LRU-BaSE outperforms the state-of-the-art cache replacement policies, where LRU-BaSE's BMR is 0.63\\% and 0.33\\% less than that of Belady and Practical Flow-based Offline Optimal (PFOO), respectively, on average. In addition, compared to Learning Relaxed Belady (LRB), LRU-BaSE can yield relatively stable performance when facing workload drift. ",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has received increasing attention due to its privacy protection capability. However, the base algorithm FedAvg is vulnerable when it suffers from so-called backdoor attacks. Former researchers proposed several robust aggregation methods. Unfortunately, many of these aggregation methods are unable to defend against backdoor attacks. What's more, the attackers recently have proposed some hiding methods that further improve backdoor attacks' stealthiness, making all the existing robust aggregation methods fail. To tackle the threat of backdoor attacks, we propose a new aggregation method, X-raying Models with A Matrix (XMAM), to reveal the malicious local model updates submitted by the backdoor attackers. Since we observe that the output of the Softmax layer exhibits distinguishable patterns between malicious and benign updates, we focus on the Softmax layer's output in which the backdoor attackers are difficult to hide their malicious behavior. Specifically, like X-ray examinations, we investigate the local model updates by using a matrix as an input to get their Softmax layer's outputs. Then, we preclude updates whose outputs are abnormal by clustering. Without any training dataset in the server, the extensive evaluations show that our XMAM can effectively distinguish malicious local model updates from benign ones. For instance, when other methods fail to defend against the backdoor attacks at no more than 20% malicious clients, our method can tolerate 45% malicious clients in the black-box mode and about 30% in Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) mode. Besides, under adaptive attacks, the results demonstrate that XMAM can still complete the global model training task even when there are 40% malicious clients. Finally, we analyze our method's screening complexity, and the results show that XMAM is about 10-10000 times faster than the existing methods. ",

These mechanisms enable the construction of a small, efficient version of commercial-scale models with comparable accuracy, accelerating their deployment to resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we study the security considerations of publishing on-device variants of large-scale models. We first show that an adversary can exploit on-device models to make attacking the large models easier. In evaluations across 19 DNNs, by exploiting the published on-device models as a transfer prior, the adversarial vulnerability of the original commercial-scale models increases by up to 100x. We then show that the vulnerability increases as the similarity between a full-scale and its efficient model increase. Based on the insights, we propose a defense, $similarity$-$unpairing$, that fine-tunes on-device models with the objective of reducing the similarity. We evaluated our defense on all the 19 DNNs and found that it reduces the transferability up to 90% and the number of queries required by a factor of 10-100x. Our results suggest that further research is needed on the security (or even privacy) threats caused by publishing those efficient siblings. ",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have brought a lot of advancements in sequence labeling tasks and sequence data. However, their effectiveness is limited when the observations in the sequence are irregularly sampled, where the observations arrive at irregular time intervals. To address this, continuous time variants of the RNNs were introduced based on neural ordinary differential equations (NODE). They learn a better representation of the data using the continuous transformation of hidden states over time, taking into account the time interval between the observations. However, they are still limited in their capability as they use the discrete transformations and a fixed discrete number of layers (depth) over an input in the sequence to produce the output observation. We intend to address this limitation by proposing RNNs based on differential equations which model continuous transformations over both depth and time to predict an output for a given input in the sequence. Specifically, we propose continuous depth recurrent neural differential equations (CDR-NDE) which generalizes RNN models by continuously evolving the hidden states in both the temporal and depth dimensions. CDR-NDE considers two separate differential equations over each of these dimensions and models the evolution in the temporal and depth directions alternatively.

    "abstract": "The number of registered SIM cards and active mobile phone subscribers in Zambia in 2020 surpassed the population of the country. This clearly shows that mobile phones in Zambia have become part of everyday life easing not only the way people communicate but also the way people perform financial transactions owing to the integration of mobile phone systems with financial payment systems. This development has not come without a cost. Cyberattackers, using various social engineering techniques have jumped onto the bandwagon to defraud unsuspecting users. Considering the aforesaid, this paper presents a high-order analytical approach towards mobile phone-based social engineering cyberattacks (phishing, SMishing, and Vishing) in Zambia which seek to defraud benign victims. This paper presents a baseline study to reiterate the problem at hand. Furthermore, we devise an attack model and an evaluation framework and ascertain the most prevalent types of attack. We also present a logistic regression analysis in the results section to conclude the most prevalent mobile phone-based type of social engineering attack. Based on the artifacts and observed insights, we suggest recommendations to mitigate these emergent social engineering cyberattacks. ",

We interweave the robust optimization with the sequence networked submodular maximization. The elements are connected by a directed acyclic graph and the objective function is not submodular on the elements but on the edges in the graph. Under such networked submodular scenario, the impact of removing an element from a sequence depends both on its position in the sequence and in the network. This makes the existing robust algorithms inapplicable. In this paper, we take the first step to study the RoseNets problem. We design a robust greedy algorithm, which is robust against the removal of an arbitrary subset of the selected elements. The approximation ratio of the algorithm depends both on the number of the removed elements and the network topology. We further conduct experiments on real applications of recommendation and link prediction. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. ",

    "abstract": "The past two decades have seen increasingly rapid advances in the field of multi-view representation learning due to it extracting useful information from diverse domains to facilitate the development of multi-view applications. However, the community faces two challenges: i) how to learn robust representations from a large amount of unlabeled data to against noise or incomplete views setting, and ii) how to balance view consistency and complementary for various downstream tasks. To this end, we utilize a deep fusion network to fuse view-specific representations into the view-common representation, extracting high-level semantics for obtaining robust representation. In addition, we employ a clustering task to guide the fusion network to prevent it from leading to trivial solutions. For balancing consistency and complementary, then, we design an asymmetrical contrastive strategy that aligns the view-common representation and each view-specific representation. These modules are incorporated into a unified method known as CLustering-guided cOntrastiVE fusioN (CLOVEN). We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the proposed method on five datasets, demonstrating that CLOVEN outperforms 11 competitive multi-view learning methods in clustering and classification. In the incomplete view scenario, our proposed method resists noise interference better than those of our competitors. Furthermore, the visualization analysis shows that CLOVEN can preserve the intrinsic structure of view-specific representation while also improving the compactness of view-commom representation.

    "abstract": "Video representation learning has been successful in video-text pre-training for zero-shot transfer, where each sentence is trained to be close to the paired video clips in a common feature space. For long videos, given a paragraph of description where the sentences describe different segments of the video, by matching all sentence-clip pairs, the paragraph and the full video are aligned implicitly. However, such unit-level similarity measure may ignore the global temporal context over a long time span, which inevitably limits the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a contrastive learning framework TempCLR to compare the full video and the paragraph explicitly. As the video/paragraph is formulated as a sequence of clips/sentences, under the constraint of their temporal order, we use dynamic time warping to compute the minimum cumulative cost over sentence-clip pairs as the sequence-level distance. To explore the temporal dynamics, we break the consistency of temporal order by shuffling the video clips or sentences according to the temporal granularity. In this way, we obtain the representations for clips/sentences, which perceive the temporal information and thus facilitate the sequence alignment. In addition to pre-training on the video and paragraph, our approach can also generalize on the matching between different video instances. We evaluate our approach on video retrieval, action step localization, and few-shot action recognition, and achieve consistent performance gain over all three tasks. Detailed ablation studies are provided to justify the approach design. ",

It is targeted for the peculiar over-smoothness of ViTs in semantic segmentation, and therefore differs from current popular paradigms of context modeling and most existing related methods reinforcing the advantage of attention. We first deliver the decoupled two-pathway network in which another pathway enhances and passes down local-patch discrepancy complementary to global representations of transformers. We then propose the spatially adaptive separation module to obtain more separate deep representations and the discriminative cross-attention which yields more discriminative region representations through novel auxiliary supervisions. The proposed methods achieve some impressive results: 1) incorporated with large-scale plain ViTs, our methods achieve new state-of-the-art performances on five widely used benchmarks; 2) using masked pre-trained plain ViTs, we achieve 68.9% mIoU on Pascal Context, setting a new record; 3) pyramid ViTs integrated with the decoupled two-pathway network even surpass the well-designed high-resolution ViTs on Cityscapes; 4) the improved representations by our framework have favorable transferability in images with natural corruptions.

For real-world applications of RL, recovering underlying latent states is crucial, particularly when sensory inputs contain irrelevant and exogenous information. In this work, we study how information bottlenecks can be used to construct latent states efficiently in the presence of task-irrelevant information. We propose architectures that utilize variational and discrete information bottlenecks, coined as RepDIB, to learn structured factorized representations. Exploiting the expressiveness bought by factorized representations, we introduce a simple, yet effective, bottleneck that can be integrated with any existing self-supervised objective for RL. We demonstrate this across several online and offline RL benchmarks, along with a real robot arm task, where we find that compressed representations with RepDIB can lead to strong performance improvements, as the learned bottlenecks help predict only the relevant state while ignoring irrelevant information.

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph contrastive learning has received wide attention recently. Some existing methods use meta-paths, which are sequences of object types that capture semantic relationships between objects, to construct contrastive views. However, most of them ignore the rich meta-path context information that describes how two objects are connected by meta-paths. On the other hand, they fail to distinguish hard negatives from false negatives, which could adversely affect the model performance. To address the problems, we propose MEOW, a heterogeneous graph contrastive learning model that considers both meta-path contexts and weighted negative samples. Specifically, MEOW constructs a coarse view and a fine-grained view for contrast. The former reflects which objects are connected by meta-paths, while the latter uses meta-path contexts and characterizes the details on how the objects are connected. We take node embeddings in the coarse view as anchors, and construct positive and negative samples from the fine-grained view. Further, to distinguish hard negatives from false negatives, we learn weights of negative samples based on node clustering. We also use prototypical contrastive learning to pull close embeddings of nodes in the same cluster. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority of MEOW against other state-of-the-art methods. ",

To avoid the problem that in the presence of noise, neural networks trained to nearly zero training error are inconsistent in this class, we focus on the early-stopped GD which allows us to show consistency and optimal rates. In particular, we explore this problem from the viewpoint of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) approximation of a GD-trained finite-width neural network. We show that whenever some early stopping rule is guaranteed to give an optimal rate (of excess risk) on the Hilbert space of the kernel induced by the ReLU activation function, the same rule can be used to achieve minimax optimal rate for learning on the class of considered Lipschitz functions by neural networks. We discuss several data-free and data-dependent practically appealing stopping rules that yield optimal rates. ",

Deep neural network-based models have reached the state-of-the-art benchmark of the RS owing to their fitting capabilities. However, prior works mainly focus on designing an intricate architecture with fixed loss function and regulation. These single-metric models provide limited performance when facing heterogeneous and sparse user behavior data. Motivated by this finding, we propose a multi-metric AutoRec (MMA) based on the representative AutoRec. The idea of the proposed MMA is mainly two-fold: 1) apply different $L_p$-norm on loss function and regularization to form different variant models in different metric spaces, and 2) aggregate these variant models. Thus, the proposed MMA enjoys the multi-metric orientation from a set of dispersed metric spaces, achieving a comprehensive representation of user data. Theoretical studies proved that the proposed MMA could attain performance improvement. The extensive experiment on five real-world datasets proves that MMA can outperform seven other state-of-the-art models in predicting unobserved user behavior data. ",

In this work, we present a novel, explainable, topical recommendation system, that utilizes social annotations, to help Twitter users discover tweets, on topics of their interest. A major challenge in using traditional rating dependent recommendation systems, like collaborative filtering and content based systems, in high volume social networks is that, due to attention scarcity most items do not get any ratings. Additionally, the fact that most Twitter users are passive consumers, with 44% users never tweeting, makes it very difficult to use user ratings for generating recommendations. Further, a key challenge in developing recommendation systems is that in many cases users reject relevant recommendations if they are totally unfamiliar with the recommended item. Providing a suitable explanation, for why the item is recommended, significantly improves the acceptability of recommendation. By virtue of being a topical recommendation system our method is able to present simple topical explanations for the generated recommendations. Comparisons with state-of-the-art matrix factorization based collaborative filtering, content based and social recommendations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. ",

Because legal documents often contain long articles and only some parts are relevant to queries, it is quite a challenge for existing models to represent such documents. In this paper, we study the use of attentive neural network-based text representation for statute law document retrieval. We propose a general approach using deep neural networks with attention mechanisms. Based on it, we develop two hierarchical architectures with sparse attention to represent long sentences and articles, and we name them Attentive CNN and Paraformer.

Experimental results show that: i) Attentive neural methods substantially outperform non-neural methods in terms of retrieval performance across datasets and languages; ii) Pretrained transformer-based models achieve better accuracy on small datasets at the cost of high computational complexity while lighter weight Attentive CNN achieves better accuracy on large datasets; and iii) Our proposed Paraformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods on COLIEE dataset, achieving the highest recall and F2 scores in the top-N retrieval task.

Furthermore, we observe that our proposed approach has improved smoothness and inherent regularization that make it well-suited for system ID and provide mathematical explanations for these characteristics' origins. Finally, numerical simulations demonstrate a mean squared error over 8.7 times lower compared to multiple shooting when data are noisy and/or sparse.

    "abstract": "Due to the issue that existing wireless sensor network (WSN)-based anomaly detection methods only consider and analyze temporal features, in this paper, a self-supervised learning-based anomaly node detection method based on an autoencoder is designed. This method integrates temporal WSN data flow feature extraction, spatial position feature extraction and intermodal WSN correlation feature extraction into the design of the autoencoder to make full use of the spatial and temporal information of the WSN for anomaly detection. First, a fully connected network is used to extract the temporal features of nodes by considering a single mode from a local spatial perspective. Second, a graph neural network (GNN) is used to introduce the WSN topology from a global spatial perspective for anomaly detection and extract the spatial and temporal features of the data flows of nodes and their neighbors by considering a single mode. Then, the adaptive fusion method involving weighted summation is used to extract the relevant features between different models. In addition, this paper introduces a gated recurrent unit (GRU) to solve the long-term dependence problem of the time dimension. Eventually, the reconstructed output of the decoder and the hidden layer representation of the autoencoder are fed into a fully connected network to calculate the anomaly probability of the current system. Since the spatial feature extraction operation is advanced, the designed method can be applied to the task of large-scale network anomaly detection by adding a clustering operation. Experiments show that the designed method outperforms the baselines, and the F1 score reaches 90.6%, which is 5.2% higher than those of the existing anomaly detection methods based on unsupervised reconstruction and prediction.

In DA, the amount of training data instances is increased by making different transformations on the available data instances to generate new correct and representative data instances. DA increases the dataset size and its variability, which enhances the model performance and its prediction accuracy. DA also solves the class imbalance problem in the classification learning techniques. Few studies have recently considered DA in the Arabic language. These studies rely on traditional augmentation approaches, such as paraphrasing by using rules or noising-based techniques. In this paper, we propose a new Arabic DA method that employs the recent powerful modeling technique, namely the AraGPT-2, for the augmentation process. The generated sentences are evaluated in terms of context, semantics, diversity, and novelty using the Euclidean, cosine, Jaccard, and BLEU distances. Finally, the AraBERT transformer is used on sentiment classification tasks to evaluate the classification performance of the augmented Arabic dataset. The experiments were conducted on four sentiment Arabic datasets, namely AraSarcasm, ASTD, ATT, and MOVIE. The selected datasets vary in size, label number, and unbalanced classes. The results show that the proposed methodology enhanced the Arabic sentiment text classification on all datasets with an increase in F1 score by 4% in AraSarcasm, 6% in ASTD, 9% in ATT, and 13% in MOVIE.

    "abstract": "With growing sophistication and volume of cyber attacks combined with complex network structures, it is becoming extremely difficult for security analysts to corroborate evidences to identify multistage campaigns on their network. This work develops HeAT (Heated Alert Triage): given a critical indicator of compromise (IoC), e.g., a severe IDS alert, HeAT produces a HeATed Attack Campaign (HAC) depicting the multistage activities that led up to the critical event. We define the concept of \"Alert Episode Heat\" to represent the analysts opinion of how much an event contributes to the attack campaign of the critical IoC given their knowledge of the network and security expertise. Leveraging a network-agnostic feature set, HeAT learns the essence of analyst's assessment of \"HeAT\" for a small set of IoC's, and applies the learned model to extract insightful attack campaigns for IoC's not seen before, even across networks by transferring what have been learned. We demonstrate the capabilities of HeAT with data collected in Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC) and through collaboration with a real-world SOC. We developed HeAT-Gain metrics to demonstrate how analysts may assess and benefit from the extracted attack campaigns in comparison to common practices where IP addresses are used to corroborate evidences. Our results demonstrates the practical uses of HeAT by finding campaigns that span across diverse attack stages, remove a significant volume of irrelevant alerts, and achieve coherency to the analyst's original assessments.

We present a method for transferring parameters between neural networks with different architectures. Our method, called DPIAT, uses dynamic programming to match blocks and layers between architectures and transfer parameters efficiently. Compared to existing parameter prediction and random initialization methods, it significantly improves training efficiency and validation accuracy. In experiments on ImageNet, our method improved validation accuracy by an average of 1.6 times after 50 epochs of training. DPIAT allows both researchers and neural architecture search systems to modify trained networks and reuse knowledge, avoiding the need for retraining from scratch.

Our method is interactive and relies on a question and answer model which asks the oracle (user) questions about the most informative display (dubbed as virtual exemplars), and according to the user's responses, updates change detections. The main contribution of our method consists in a novel adversarial model that allows frugally probing the oracle with only the most representative, diverse and uncertain virtual exemplars. The latter are learned to challenge the most the trained change decision criteria which ultimately leads to a better re-estimate of these criteria in the following iterations of active learning.

    "abstract": "To achieve accurate and low-cost 3D object detection, existing methods propose to benefit camera-based multi-view detectors with spatial cues provided by the LiDAR modality, e.g., dense depth supervision and bird-eye-view (BEV) feature distillation. However, they directly conduct point-to-point mimicking from LiDAR to camera, which neglects the inner-geometry of foreground targets and suffers from the modal gap between 2D-3D features. In this paper, we propose the learning scheme of Target Inner-Geometry from the LiDAR modality into camera-based BEV detectors for both dense depth and BEV features, termed as TiG-BEV. First, we introduce an inner-depth supervision module to learn the low-level relative depth relations between different foreground pixels. This enables the camera-based detector to better understand the object-wise spatial structures. Second, we design an inner-feature BEV distillation module to imitate the high-level semantics of different keypoints within foreground targets. To further alleviate the BEV feature gap between two modalities, we adopt both inter-channel and inter-keypoint distillation for feature-similarity modeling. With our target inner-geometry distillation, TiG-BEV can effectively boost BEVDepth by +2.3% NDS and +2.4% mAP, along with BEVDet by +9.1% NDS and +10.3% mAP on nuScenes val set.

We are thus motivated to assess the adversarial robustness of the Machine Learning models residing at the core of these security-critical applications with categorical inputs. Previous research efforts on accessing model robustness against manipulation of categorical inputs are specific to use cases and heavily depend on domain knowledge, or require white-box access to the target ML model. Such limitations prevent the robustness assessment from being as a domain-agnostic service provided to various real-world applications. We propose a provably optimal yet computationally highly efficient adversarial robustness assessment protocol for a wide band of ML-driven cybersecurity-critical applications. We demonstrate the use of the domain-agnostic robustness assessment method with substantial experimental study on fake news detection and intrusion detection problems. ",

Due to the increasing amounts of data generated by monitoring tools as well as more and more sophisticated attacks, these ML methods are gaining traction. Knowledge graphs and their corresponding learning techniques such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with their ability to seamlessly integrate data from multiple domains using human-understandable vocabularies, are finding application in the cybersecurity domain. However, similar to other connectionist models, GNNs are lacking transparency in their decision making. This is especially important as there tend to be a high number of false positive alerts in the cybersecurity domain, such that triage needs to be done by domain experts, requiring a lot of man power. Therefore, we are addressing Explainable AI (XAI) for GNNs to enhance trust management by exploring combining symbolic and sub-symbolic methods in the area of cybersecurity that incorporate domain knowledge. We experimented with this approach by generating explanations in an industrial demonstrator system. The proposed method is shown to produce intuitive explanations for alerts for a diverse range of scenarios. Not only do the explanations provide deeper insights into the alerts, but they also lead to a reduction of false positive alerts by 66% and by 93% when including the fidelity metric. ",

    "abstract": "A key feature of federated learning (FL) is to preserve the data privacy of end users. However, there still exist potential privacy leakage in exchanging gradients under FL. As a result, recent research often explores the differential privacy (DP) approaches to add noises to the computing results to address privacy concerns with low overheads, which however degrade the model performance. In this paper, we strike the balance of data privacy and efficiency by utilizing the pervasive social connections between users. Specifically, we propose SCFL, a novel Social-aware Clustered Federated Learning scheme, where mutually trusted individuals can freely form a social cluster and aggregate their raw model updates (e.g., gradients) inside each cluster before uploading to the cloud for global aggregation. By mixing model updates in a social group, adversaries can only eavesdrop the social-layer combined results, but not the privacy of individuals. We unfold the design of SCFL in three steps. \\emph{i) Stable social cluster formation. Considering users' heterogeneous training samples and data distributions, we formulate the optimal social cluster formation problem as a federation game and devise a fair revenue allocation mechanism to resist free-riders. ii) Differentiated trust-privacy mapping}. For the clusters with low mutual trust, we design a customizable privacy preservation mechanism to adaptively sanitize participants' model updates depending on social trust degrees. iii) Distributed convergence}. A distributed two-sided matching algorithm is devised to attain an optimized disjoint partition with Nash-stable convergence. Experiments on Facebook network and MNIST/CIFAR-10 datasets validate that our SCFL can effectively enhance learning utility, improve user payoff, and enforce customizable privacy protection. ",

Artificial intelligence-based NIDS are powerful tools that can learn complex data correlations for accurate attack prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide an opportunity to analyze network topology along with flow features which makes them particularly suitable for NIDS applications. However, successful application of such tool requires large amounts of carefully collected and labeled data for training and testing. In this paper we inspect different versions of ToN-IoT dataset and point out inconsistencies in some versions. We filter the full version of ToN-IoT and present a new version labeled ToN-IoT-R. To ensure generalization we propose a new standardized and compact set of flow features which are derived solely from NetFlowv5-compatible data. We separate numeric data and flags into different categories and propose a new dataset-agnostic normalization approach for numeric features. This allows us to preserve meaning of flow flags and we propose to conduct targeted analysis based on, for instance, network protocols. For flow classification we use E-GraphSage algorithm with modified node initialization technique that allows us to add node degree to node features. We achieve high classification accuracy on ToN-IoT-R and compare it with previously published results for ToN-IoT, NF-ToN-IoT, and NF-ToN-IoT-v2. We highlight the importance of careful data collection and labeling and appropriate data preprocessing choice and conclude that the proposed set of features is more applicable for real NIDS due to being less demanding to traffic monitoring equipment while preserving high flow classification accuracy.

Like physics-informed neural networks (PINN), CINN is a meshless machine learning solver with universal approximation capabilities. Unlike PINN, which enforces a PDE softly via a multi-part loss function, CINN encodes the characteristics of the PDE in a general-purpose deep neural network trained with the usual MSE data-fitting regression loss and standard deep learning optimization methods. This leads to faster training and can avoid well-known pathologies of gradient descent optimization of multi-part PINN loss functions. If the characteristic ODEs can be solved exactly, which is true in important cases, the output of a CINN is an exact solution of the PDE, even at initialization, preventing the occurrence of non-physical outputs. Otherwise, the ODEs must be solved approximately, but the CINN is still trained only using a data-fitting loss function. The performance of CINN is assessed empirically in forward and inverse linear hyperbolic problems. These preliminary results indicate that CINN is able to improve on the accuracy of the baseline PINN, while being nearly twice as fast to train and avoiding non-physical solutions. Future extensions to hyperbolic PDE systems and nonlinear PDEs are also briefly discussed. ",

The sub-muscular motion in faces has different interpretations per different generative models which is reflected in their generative residue. Our approach exploits the difference between real motion and the amplified GAN fingerprints, by combining deep and traditional motion magnification, to detect whether a video is fake and its source generator if so. Evaluating our approach on two multi-source datasets, we obtain 97.17% and 94.03% for video source detection. We compare against the prior deepfake source detector and other complex architectures.

A recent study measured the in vivo two-dimensional tuning maps of neurons in different brain regions. Here, we developed a statistically reliable signature for these maps based on the change of topology in level sets. We found this topological signature changed progressively throughout the cortical hierarchy, with similar trends found for units in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Further, we analyzed the geometry of level sets on the tuning landscapes of CNN units. We advanced the hypothesis that higher-order units can be locally regarded as isotropic radial basis functions, but not globally.

    "abstract": "Seismic data often undergoes severe noise due to environmental factors, which seriously affects subsequent applications. Traditional hand-crafted denoisers such as filters and regularizations utilize interpretable domain knowledge to design generalizable denoising techniques, while their representation capacities may be inferior to deep learning denoisers, which can learn complex and representative denoising mappings from abundant training pairs. However, due to the scarcity of high-quality training pairs, deep learning denoisers may sustain some generalization issues over various scenarios. In this work, we propose a self-supervised method that combines the capacities of deep denoiser and the generalization abilities of hand-crafted regularization for seismic data random noise attenuation. Specifically, we leverage the Self2Self (S2S) learning framework with a trace-wise masking strategy for seismic data denoising by solely using the observed noisy data. Parallelly, we suggest the weighted total variation (WTV) to further capture the horizontal local smooth structure of seismic data. Our method, dubbed as S2S-WTV, enjoys both high representation abilities brought from the self-supervised deep network and good generalization abilities of the hand-crafted WTV regularizer and the self-supervised nature. Therefore, our method can more effectively and stably remove the random noise and preserve the details and edges of the clean signal. To tackle the S2S-WTV optimization model, we introduce an alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM)-based algorithm. Extensive experiments on synthetic and field noisy seismic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as compared with state-of-the-art traditional and deep learning-based seismic data denoising methods.

However, it has been discovered that modern deep neural networks are generally poorly calibrated due to the overestimation (or underestimation) of predictive confidence, which is closely related to overfitting. In this paper, we propose Annealing Double-Head, a simple-to-implement but highly effective architecture for calibrating the DNN during training. To be precise, we construct an additional calibration head-a shallow neural network that typically has one latent layer-on top of the last latent layer in the normal model to map the logits to the aligned confidence. Furthermore, a simple Annealing technique that dynamically scales the logits by calibration head in training procedure is developed to improve its performance. Under both the in-distribution and distributional shift circumstances, we exhaustively evaluate our Annealing Double-Head architecture on multiple pairs of contemporary DNN architectures and vision and speech datasets. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art model calibration performance without post-processing while simultaneously providing comparable predictive accuracy in comparison to other recently proposed calibration methods on a range of learning tasks.

The \"gold standard\" method for imaging MI is Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), with intravenously administered gadolinium-based contrast (late gadolinium enhancement). However, no \"gold standard\" fully automated method for the quantification of MI exists. In this work, we propose an end-to-end fully automatic system (MyI-Net) for the detection and quantification of MI in MRI images. This has the potential to reduce the uncertainty due to the technical variability across labs and inherent problems of the data and labels. Our system consists of four processing stages designed to maintain the flow of information across scales. First, features from raw MRI images are generated using feature extractors built on ResNet and MoblieNet architectures. This is followed by the Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) to produce spatial information at different scales to preserve more image context. High-level features from ASPP and initial low-level features are concatenated at the third stage and then passed to the fourth stage where spatial information is recovered via up-sampling to produce final image segmentation output into: i) background, ii) heart muscle, iii) blood and iv) scar areas. New models were compared with state-of-art models and manual quantification. Our models showed favorable performance in global segmentation and scar tissue detection relative to state-of-the-art work, including a four-fold better performance in matching scar pixels to contours produced by clinicians.

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) analysis of Chest X-ray (CXR) and Computed tomography (CT) images has garnered a lot of attention in recent times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well suited for the image analysis tasks when trained on humongous amounts of data. Applications developed for medical image analysis require high sensitivity and precision compared to any other fields. Most of the tools proposed for detection of COVID-19 claims to have high sensitivity and recalls but have failed to generalize and perform when tested on unseen datasets. This encouraged us to develop a CNN model, analyze and understand the performance of it by visualizing the predictions of the model using class activation maps generated using (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) Grad-CAM technique. This study provides a detailed discussion of the success and failure of the proposed model at an image level. Performance of the model is compared with state-of-the-art DL models and shown to be comparable. The data and code used are available at https://github.com/aleesuss/c19. ",

    "abstract": "Drowsiness reduces concentration and increases response time, which causes fatal road accidents. Monitoring drivers' drowsiness levels by electroencephalogram (EEG) and taking action may prevent road accidents. EEG signals effectively monitor the driver's mental state as they can monitor brain dynamics. However, calibration is required in advance because EEG signals vary between and within subjects. Because of the inconvenience, calibration has reduced the accessibility of the brain-computer interface (BCI). Developing a generalized classification model is similar to domain generalization, which overcomes the domain shift problem. Especially data augmentation is frequently used. This paper proposes a calibration-free framework for driver drowsiness state classification using manifold-level augmentation. This framework increases the diversity of source domains by utilizing features. We experimented with various augmentation methods to improve the generalization performance. Based on the results of the experiments, we found that deeper models with smaller kernel sizes improved generalizability. In addition, applying an augmentation at the manifold-level resulted in an outstanding improvement. The framework demonstrated the capability for calibration-free BCI. ",

    "abstract": "Tool flank wear monitoring can minimize machining downtime costs while increasing productivity and product quality. In some industrial applications, only a limited level of tool wear is allowed to attain necessary tolerances. It may become challenging to monitor a limited level of tool wear in the data collected from the machine due to the other components, such as the flexible vibrations of the machine, dominating the measurement signals. In this study, a tool wear monitoring technique to predict limited levels of tool wear from the spindle motor current and dynamometer measurements is presented. High-frequency spindle motor current data is collected with an industrial edge device while the cutting forces and torque are measured with a rotary dynamometer in drilling tests for a selected number of holes. Feature engineering is conducted to identify the statistical features of the measurement signals that are most sensitive to small changes in tool wear. A neural network based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture is developed to predict tool flank wear from the measured spindle motor current and dynamometer signals. It is demonstrated that the proposed technique predicts tool flank wear with good accuracy and high computational efficiency. The proposed technique can easily be implemented in an industrial edge device as a real-time predictive maintenance application to minimize the costs due to manufacturing downtime and tool underuse or overuse.

Despite the significant advances in sleep stage scoring in the last few years, most of them mainly focused on the increment of model performance. However, other problems still exist: the bias of labels in datasets and the instability of model performance by repetitive training. To alleviate these problems, we propose the SST, a novel sleep stage scoring model with a selective batch sampling strategy and self-knowledge distillation. To evaluate how robust the model was to the bias of labels, we used different datasets for training and testing: the sleep heart health study and the Sleep-EDF datasets. In this condition, the SST showed competitive performance in sleep stage scoring. In addition, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the selective batch sampling strategy with a reduction of the standard deviation of performance by repetitive training. These results could show that SST extracted effective learning features against the bias of labels in datasets, and the selective batch sampling strategy worked for the model robustness in training.

While it can be good, since it helps humans to adapt to new and different situations, it can also be harmful when not dealt with properly, leading to chronic stress. The objective of this paper is developing a stress monitoring solution, that can be used in real life, while being able to tackle this challenge in a positive way. The SMILE data set was provided to team Anxolotl, and all it was needed was to develop a robust model. We developed a supervised learning model for classification in Python, presenting the final result of 64.1% in accuracy and a f1-score of 54.96%. The resulting solution stood the robustness test, presenting low variation between runs, which was a major point for it's possible integration in the Anxolotl app in the future. ",
