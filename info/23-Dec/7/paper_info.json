    "abstract": "The subgraph isomorphism finding problem is a well-studied problem in the field of computer science and graph theory, and it aims to enumerate all instances of a query graph in the respective data graph. In this paper, we propose an efficient method, SubISO, to find subgraph isomorphisms using an objective function, which exploits some isomorphic invariants and eccentricity of the query graph's vertices. The proposed objective function is used to determine pivot vertex, which minimizes both number and size of the candidate regions in the data graph. SubISO also limits the maximum recursive calls of the generic SubgraphSearch function to deal with straggler queries for which most of the existing algorithms show exponential behaviour. The proposed approach is evaluated over three benchmark datasets. It is also compared with three well known subgraph isomorphism finding algorithms in terms of execution time, number of identified embeddings, and ability to deal with the straggler queries, and it performs significantly better.

    "title": "Learning Multi-graph Structure for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning that forecasts future events based on historical snapshots distributed over timestamps is denoted as extrapolation and has gained significant attention. Owing to its extreme versatility and variation in spatial and temporal correlations, TKG reasoning presents a challenging task, demanding efficient capture of concurrent structures and evolutional interactions among facts. While existing methods have made strides in this direction, they still fall short of harnessing the diverse forms of intrinsic expressive semantics of TKGs, which encompass entity correlations across multiple timestamps and periodicity of temporal information. This limitation constrains their ability to thoroughly reflect historical dependencies and future trends. In response to these drawbacks, this paper proposes an innovative reasoning approach that focuses on Learning Multi-graph Structure (LMS). Concretely, it comprises three distinct modules concentrating on multiple aspects of graph structure knowledge within TKGs, including concurrent and evolutional patterns along timestamps, query-specific correlations across timestamps, and semantic dependencies of timestamps, which capture TKG features from various perspectives. Besides, LMS incorporates an adaptive gate for merging entity representations both along and across timestamps effectively. Moreover, it integrates timestamp semantics into graph attention calculations and time-aware decoders, in order to impose temporal constraints on events and narrow down prediction scopes with historical statistics. Extensive experimental results on five event-based benchmark datasets demonstrate that LMS outperforms state-of-the-art extrapolation models, indicating the superiority of modeling a multi-graph perspective for TKG reasoning.

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection is a critical and challenging task that aims to identify data points deviating from normal patterns and distributions within a dataset. Various methods have been proposed using a one-class-one-model approach, but these techniques often face practical problems such as memory inefficiency and the requirement of sufficient data for training. In particular, few-shot anomaly detection presents significant challenges in industrial applications, where limited samples are available before mass production. In this paper, we propose a few-shot anomaly detection method that integrates adversarial training loss to obtain more robust and generalized feature representations. We utilize the adversarial loss previously employed in domain adaptation to align feature distributions between source and target domains, to enhance feature robustness and generalization in few-shot anomaly detection tasks. We hypothesize that adversarial loss is effective when applied to features that should have similar characteristics, such as those from the same layer in a Siamese network's parallel branches or input-output pairs of reconstruction-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method generally achieves better performance when utilizing the adversarial loss. ",

This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (RL) strategy, centered around the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, to schedule a community battery system in the presence of uncertainties, such as solar photovoltaic (PV) generation, local demand, and real-time energy prices. We position the community battery to play a versatile role, in integrating local PV energy, reducing peak load, and exploiting energy price fluctuations for arbitrage, thereby minimizing the system cost. To improve exploration and convergence during RL training, we utilize the noisy network technique. This paper conducts a comparative study of different RL algorithms, including proximal policy optimization (PPO) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms, to evaluate their effectiveness in the community battery scheduling problem. The results demonstrate the potential of RL in addressing community battery scheduling challenges and show that the SAC algorithm achieves the best performance compared to RL and optimization benchmarks.

Departing from the conventional approach, CooperKGC establishes a collaborative processing network, assembling a KGC collaboration team capable of concurrently addressing entity, relation, and event extraction tasks. Our experiments unequivocally demonstrate that fostering collaboration and information interaction among diverse agents within CooperKGC yields superior results compared to individual cognitive processes operating in isolation.

Among these, adversarial patches have drawn increasing attention due to their good applicability to fool DNNs in the physical world. However, existing works often generate patches with meaningless noise or patterns, making it conspicuous to humans. To address this issue, we explore how to generate visually realistic adversarial patches to fool DNNs. Firstly, we analyze that a high-quality adversarial patch should be realistic, position irrelevant, and printable to be deployed in the physical world. Based on this analysis, we propose an effective attack called VRAP, to generate visually realistic adversarial patches. Specifically, VRAP constrains the patch in the neighborhood of a real image to ensure the visual reality, optimizes the patch at the poorest position for position irrelevance, and adopts Total Variance loss as well as gamma transformation to make the generated patch printable without losing information. Empirical evaluations on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that the proposed VRAP exhibits outstanding attack performance in the digital world. Moreover, the generated adversarial patches can be disguised as the scrawl or logo in the physical world to fool the deep models without being detected, bringing significant threats to DNNs-enabled applications.

    "abstract": "The deep neural network (DNN) has been proven effective in various domains. However, they often struggle to perform well on certain minority groups during inference, despite showing strong performance on the majority of data groups. This is because over-parameterized models learned \\textit{bias attributes} from a large number of \\textit{bias-aligned} training samples. These bias attributes are strongly spuriously correlated with the target variable, causing the models to be biased towards spurious correlations (i.e., \\textit{bias-conflicting}). To tackle this issue, we propose a novel \\textbf{re}weighted \\textbf{s}parse \\textbf{t}raining framework, dubbed as \\textit{\\textbf{REST}}, which aims to enhance the performance of biased data while improving computation and memory efficiency. Our proposed REST framework has been experimentally validated on three datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in exploring unbiased subnetworks.

We highlight that the \\textit{REST} framework represents a promising approach for improving the performance of DNNs on biased data, while simultaneously improving computation and memory efficiency. By reducing the reliance on spurious correlations, REST has the potential to enhance the robustness of DNNs and improve their generalization capabilities.

In this paper, we delve into interactivities understanding within visual content by deriving scene graph representations from dense interactivities among humans and objects. To achieve this goal, we first present a new dataset containing Appearance-Situation-Position-Interaction-Relation predicates, named ASPIRe, offering an extensive collection of videos marked by a wide range of interactivities. Then, we propose a new approach named Hierarchical Interlacement Graph (HIG), which leverages a unified layer and graph within a hierarchical structure to provide deep insights into scene changes across five distinct tasks.

Given the difficulty of the decoding problem, progress has been made to understand the easier encoding problem, i.e., to convert an interpretable algorithm into network weights. Previous works focus on encoding existing algorithms into networks, which are interpretable by definition. However, focusing on encoding limits the possibility of discovering new algorithms that humans have never stumbled upon, but that are nevertheless interpretable. In this work, we explore the possibility of using hypernetworks to generate interpretable networks whose underlying algorithms are not yet known. The hypernetwork is carefully designed such that it can control network complexity, leading to a diverse family of interpretable algorithms ranked by their complexity. All of them are interpretable in hindsight, although some of them are less intuitive to humans, hence providing new insights regarding how to \"think\" like a neural network. For the task of computing L1 norms, hypernetworks find three algorithms: (a) the double-sided algorithm, (b) the convexity algorithm, (c) the pudding algorithm, although only the first algorithm was expected by the authors before experiments. We automatically classify these algorithms and analyze how these algorithmic phases develop during training, as well as how they are affected by complexity control. Furthermore, we show that a trained hypernetwork can correctly construct models for input dimensions not seen in training, demonstrating systematic generalization. ",

We propose formulating PCR as a denoising diffusion probabilistic process, mapping noisy transformations to the ground truth. However, using diffusion models for PCR has nontrivial challenges, such as adapting a generative model to a discriminative task and leveraging the estimated nonlinear transformation from the previous step. Instead of training a diffusion model to directly map pure noise to ground truth, we map the predictions of an off-the-shelf PCR model to ground truth. The predictions of off-the-shelf models are often imperfect, especially in challenging cases where the two points clouds have low overlap, and thus could be seen as noisy versions of the real rigid transformation. In addition, we transform the rotation matrix into a spherical linear space for interpolation between samples in the forward process, and convert rigid transformations into auxiliary information to implicitly exploit last-step estimations in the reverse process. As a result, conditioned on time step, the denoising model adapts to the increasing accuracy across steps and refines registrations. Our extensive experiments showcase the effectiveness of our DiffusionPCR, yielding state-of-the-art registration recall rates (95.3%/81.6%) on 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch.

Universal adversarial attack methods such as Fast Sign Gradient Method (FSGM) and Projected Gradient Descend (PGD) are popular for LiDAR object detection, but they are often deficient compared to task-specific adversarial attacks. Additionally, these universal methods typically require unrestricted access to the model's information, which is difficult to obtain in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we present a black-box Scaling Adversarial Robustness (ScAR) method for LiDAR object detection. By analyzing the statistical characteristics of 3D object detection datasets such as KITTI, Waymo, and nuScenes, we have found that the model's prediction is sensitive to scaling of 3D instances. We propose three black-box scaling adversarial attack methods based on the available information: model-aware attack, distribution-aware attack, and blind attack. We also introduce a strategy for generating scaling adversarial examples to improve the model's robustness against these three scaling adversarial attacks. Comparison with other methods on public datasets under different 3D object detection architectures demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method. ",

    "abstract": "We argue that many general evaluation problems can be viewed through the lens of voting theory. Each task is interpreted as a separate voter, which requires only ordinal rankings or pairwise comparisons of agents to produce an overall evaluation. By viewing the aggregator as a social welfare function, we are able to leverage centuries of research in social choice theory to derive principled evaluation frameworks with axiomatic foundations. These evaluations are interpretable and flexible, while avoiding many of the problems currently facing cross-task evaluation. We apply this Voting-as-Evaluation (VasE) framework across multiple settings, including reinforcement learning, large language models, and humans. In practice, we observe that VasE can be more robust than popular evaluation frameworks (Elo and Nash averaging), discovers properties in the evaluation data not evident from scores alone, and can predict outcomes better than Elo in a complex seven-player game. We identify one particular approach, maximal lotteries, that satisfies important consistency properties relevant to evaluation, is computationally efficient (polynomial in the size of the evaluation data), and identifies game-theoretic cycles ",

    "abstract": "Since the advent of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC), the requirements of low-latency applications tend to be completely characterized by a single pre-defined latency-reliability target. That is, operation is optimal whenever the pre-defined latency threshold is met but the system is assumed to be in error when the latency threshold is violated. This vision is severely limited and does not capture the real requirements of most applications, where multiple latency thresholds can be defined, together with incentives or rewards associated with meeting each of them. Such formulation is a generalization of the single-threshold case popularized by URLLC and, in the asymptotic case, approximates to defining a cost for each point in the support of the latency distribution. In this paper, we explore the implications of defining multiple latency targets on the design of access protocols and on the optimization of repetition-based access strategies in orthogonal and non-orthogonal multiple access scenarios with users that present heterogeneous traffic characteristics and requirements. We observe that the access strategies of the users can be effectively adapted to the requirements of the application by carefully defining the latency targets and the associated rewards. ",

In this work, we apply a novel and powerful computational method to the problem of learning probability densities on contagion parameters and providing uncertainty quantification for pandemic projections. Using a neural network, we calibrate an ODE model to data of the spread of COVID-19 in Berlin in 2020, achieving both a significantly more accurate calibration and prediction than Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based sampling schemes. The uncertainties on our predictions provide meaningful confidence intervals e.g. on infection figures and hospitalisation rates, while training and running the neural scheme takes minutes where MCMC takes hours. We show convergence of our method to the true posterior on a simplified SIR model of epidemics, and also demonstrate our method's learning capabilities on a reduced dataset, where a complex model is learned from a small number of compartments for which data is available.

One reason is that they make use of volume rendering, thus requiring many samples (and model queries) per ray at render time. Although this representation is flexible and easy to optimize, most real-world objects can be modeled more efficiently with surfaces instead of volumes, requiring far fewer samples per ray. This observation has spurred considerable progress in surface representations such as signed distance functions, but these may struggle to model semi-opaque and thin structures. We propose a method, HybridNeRF, that leverages the strengths of both representations by rendering most objects as surfaces while modeling the (typically) small fraction of challenging regions volumetrically. We evaluate HybridNeRF against the challenging Eyeful Tower dataset along with other commonly used view synthesis datasets. When comparing to state-of-the-art baselines, including recent rasterization-based approaches, we improve error rates by 15-30% while achieving real-time framerates (at least 36 FPS) for virtual-reality resolutions (2Kx2K).

However, personalized recommendations require considerable amount of behavioral data on users, which is usually unavailable for new users, giving rise to the cold-start problem. To help alleviate this challenging problem, we introduce a spectral graph wavelet collaborative filtering framework for implicit feedback data, where users, items and their interactions are represented as a bipartite graph. Specifically, we first propose an adaptive transfer function by leveraging a power transform with the goal of stabilizing the variance of graph frequencies in the spectral domain. Then, we design a deep recommendation model for efficient learning of low-dimensional embeddings of users and items using spectral graph wavelets in an end-to-end fashion. In addition to capturing the graph's local and global structures, our approach yields localization of graph signals in both spatial and spectral domains, and hence not only learns discriminative representations of users and items, but also promotes the recommendation quality. The effectiveness of our proposed model is demonstrated through extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets, achieving better recommendation performance compared with strong baseline methods.

In particular, we investigate the use of curiosity both as a tool for task boundary detection and as a priority metric when it comes to retaining old transition tuples, which we respectively use to propose two different buffers. Firstly, we propose a Hybrid Reservoir Buffer with Task Separation (HRBTS), where curiosity is used to detect task boundaries that are not known due to the task agnostic nature of the problem. Secondly, by using curiosity as a priority metric when it comes to retaining old transition tuples, a Hybrid Curious Buffer (HCB) is proposed. We ultimately show that these buffers, in conjunction with regular reinforcement learning algorithms, can be used to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting issue suffered by the state of the art on replay buffers when the agent's exposure to tasks is not equal along time. We evaluate catastrophic forgetting and the efficiency of our proposed buffers against the latest works such as the Hybrid Reservoir Buffer (HRB) and the Multi-Time Scale Replay Buffer (MTR) in three different continual reinforcement learning settings.

With rapidly growing large scale public sleep databases and advances in machine learning, significant progress has been made toward automatic sleep staging. However, previous studies face some critical problems in sleep studies; the heterogeneity of subjects' physiological signals, the inability to extract meaningful information from unlabeled sleep signal data to improve predictive performances, the difficulty in modeling correlations between sleep stages, and the lack of an effective mechanism to quantify predictive uncertainty. In this study, we propose a neural network based automatic sleep staging model, named DREAM, to learn domain generalized representations from physiological signals and models sleep dynamics. DREAM learns sleep related and subject invariant representations from diverse subjects' sleep signal segments and models sleep dynamics by capturing interactions between sequential signal segments and between sleep stages. In the experiments, we demonstrate that DREAM outperforms the existing sleep staging methods on three datasets. The case study demonstrates that our model can learn the generalized decision function resulting in good prediction performances for the new subjects, especially in case there are differences between testing and training subjects. The usage of unlabeled data shows the benefit of leveraging unlabeled EEG data. Further, uncertainty quantification demonstrates that DREAM provides prediction uncertainty, making the model reliable and helping sleep experts in real world applications. ",

A recent study, called Untrained GNNs Tickets (UGT), expanded SLTH from CNNs to shallow graph neural networks (GNNs). However, discrepancies persist when comparing baseline models with learned dense weights. Additionally, there remains an unexplored area in applying SLTH to deeper GNNs, which, despite delivering improved accuracy with additional layers, suffer from excessive memory requirements. To address these challenges, this work utilizes Multicoated Supermasks (M-Sup), a scalar pruning mask method, and implements it in GNNs by proposing a strategy for setting its pruning thresholds adaptively. In the context of deep GNNs, this research uncovers the existence of untrained recurrent networks, which exhibit performance on par with their trained feed-forward counterparts. This paper also introduces the Multi-Stage Folding and Unshared Masks methods to expand the search space in terms of both architecture and parameters. Through the evaluation of various datasets, including the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB), this work establishes a triple-win scenario for SLTH-based GNNs: by achieving high sparsity, competitive performance, and high memory efficiency with up to 98.7\\% reduction, it demonstrates suitability for energy-efficient graph processing.

In this paper, the potential of discovering PINNs that generalize over an entire family of physics tasks is studied, for the first time, through a biological lens of the Baldwin effect. Drawing inspiration from the neurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and react quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with connection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of physics. To this end, evolutionary selection pressure (guided by proficiency over a family of tasks) is coupled with lifetime learning (to specialize on a smaller subset of those tasks) to produce PINNs that demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities across a range of empirically challenging problem instances. The Baldwinian approach achieves an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the computation cost compared to state-of-the-art results with PINNs meta-learned by gradient descent.

However, due to the emergence and development of adversarial deep learning technologies, it becomes challenging for the adoption of DL models into IDS. In this paper, we propose a novel IDS architecture that can enhance the robustness of IDS against adversarial attacks by combining conventional machine learning (ML) models and Deep Learning models. The proposed DLL-IDS consists of three components: DL-based IDS, adversarial example (AE) detector, and ML-based IDS. We first develop a novel AE detector based on the local intrinsic dimensionality (LID). Then, we exploit the low attack transferability between DL models and ML models to find a robust ML model that can assist us in determining the maliciousness of AEs. If the input traffic is detected as an AE, the ML-based IDS will predict the maliciousness of input traffic, otherwise the DL-based IDS will work for the prediction. The fusion mechanism can leverage the high prediction accuracy of DL models and low attack transferability between DL models and ML models to improve the robustness of the whole system. In our experiments, we observe a significant improvement in the prediction performance of the IDS when subjected to adversarial attack, achieving high accuracy with low resource consumption. ",

Recently, task-oriented semantic communications have been proposed for low-latency inference with limited bandwidth. Although transmitting only task-related information does protect a certain level of user privacy, adversaries could apply model inversion techniques to reconstruct the raw data or extract useful information, thereby infringing on users' privacy. To mitigate privacy infringement, this paper proposes an information bottleneck and adversarial learning (IBAL) approach to protect users' privacy against model inversion attacks. Specifically, we extract task-relevant features from the input based on the information bottleneck (IB) theory. To overcome the difficulty in calculating the mutual information in high-dimensional space, we derive a variational upper bound to estimate the true mutual information. To prevent data reconstruction from task-related features by adversaries, we leverage adversarial learning to train encoder to fool adversaries by maximizing reconstruction distortion. Furthermore, considering the impact of channel variations on privacy-utility trade-off and the difficulty in manually tuning the weights of each loss, we propose an adaptive weight adjustment method. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approaches can effectively protect privacy without significantly affecting task performance and achieve better privacy-utility trade-offs than baseline methods.

Existing embedding compression solutions cannot simultaneously meet three key design requirements: memory efficiency, low latency, and adaptability to dynamic data distribution. This paper presents CAFE, a Compact, Adaptive, and Fast Embedding compression framework that addresses the above requirements. The design philosophy of CAFE is to dynamically allocate more memory resources to important features (called hot features), and allocate less memory to unimportant ones. In CAFE, we propose a fast and lightweight sketch data structure, named HotSketch, to capture feature importance and report hot features in real time. For each reported hot feature, we assign it a unique embedding. For the non-hot features, we allow multiple features to share one embedding by using hash embedding technique. Guided by our design philosophy, we further propose a multi-level hash embedding framework to optimize the embedding tables of non-hot features. We theoretically analyze the accuracy of HotSketch, and analyze the model convergence against deviation. Extensive experiments show that CAFE significantly outperforms existing embedding compression methods, yielding 3.92% and 3.68% superior testing AUC on Criteo Kaggle dataset and CriteoTB dataset at a compression ratio of 10000x.

    "abstract": "Training and deploying machine learning models that meet fairness criteria for protected groups are fundamental in modern artificial intelligence. While numerous constraints and regularization terms have been proposed in the literature to promote fairness in machine learning tasks, most of these methods are not amenable to stochastic optimization due to the complex and nonlinear structure of constraints and regularizers. Here, the term \"stochastic\" refers to the ability of the algorithm to work with small mini-batches of data. Motivated by the limitation of existing literature, this paper presents a unified stochastic optimization framework for fair empirical risk minimization based on f-divergence measures (f-FERM). The proposed stochastic algorithm enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees. In addition, our experiments demonstrate the superiority of fairness-accuracy tradeoffs offered by f-FERM for almost all batch sizes (ranging from full-batch to batch size of one). Moreover, we show that our framework can be extended to the case where there is a distribution shift from training to the test data. Our extension is based on a distributionally robust optimization reformulation of f-FERM objective under $L_p$ norms as uncertainty sets. Again, in this distributionally robust setting, f-FERM not only enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees but also outperforms other baselines in the literature in the tasks involving distribution shifts. An efficient stochastic implementation of $f$-FERM is publicly available. ",

This paper proposes a scalable framework for constructing a reinforcement learning policy bank that can perform RAN optimization across a large number of cell sites with varying traffic patterns. Central to our framework is a novel application of anomaly detection techniques to assess the compatibility between sites (tasks) and the policy bank. This allows our framework to intelligently identify when a policy can be reused for a task, and when a new policy needs to be trained and added to the policy bank. Our results show that our approach to compatibility assessment leads to an efficient use of computational resources, by allowing us to construct a performant policy bank without exhaustively training on all tasks, which makes it applicable under real-world constraints.

Existing AD methods leverage the teacher's logits as a guide. In contrast to these approaches, we aim to transfer another piece of knowledge from the teacher, the input gradient. In this paper, we propose a distillation module termed Indirect Gradient Distillation Module (IGDM) that indirectly matches the student's input gradient with that of the teacher. We hypothesize that students can better acquire the teacher's knowledge by matching the input gradient. Leveraging the observation that adversarial training renders the model locally linear on the input space, we employ Taylor approximation to effectively align gradients without directly calculating them. Experimental results show that IGDM seamlessly integrates with existing AD methods, significantly enhancing the performance of all AD methods. Particularly, utilizing IGDM on the CIFAR-100 dataset improves the AutoAttack accuracy from 28.06% to 30.32% with the ResNet-18 model and from 26.18% to 29.52% with the MobileNetV2 model when integrated into the SOTA method without additional data augmentation.

    "abstract": "Adversarial training integrates adversarial examples during model training to enhance robustness. However, its application in fixed dataset settings differs from real-world dynamics, where data accumulates incrementally. In this study, we investigate Adversarially Robust Class Incremental Learning (ARCIL), a method that combines adversarial robustness with incremental learning. We observe that combining incremental learning with naive adversarial training easily leads to a loss of robustness. We discover that this is attributed to the disappearance of the flatness of the loss function, a characteristic of adversarial training. To address this issue, we propose the Flatness Preserving Distillation (FPD) loss that leverages the output difference between adversarial and clean examples. Additionally, we introduce the Logit Adjustment Distillation (LAD) loss, which adapts the model's knowledge to perform well on new tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over approaches that apply adversarial training to existing incremental learning methods, which provides a strong baseline for incremental learning on adversarial robustness in the future. Our method achieves AutoAttack accuracy that is 5.99\\%p, 5.27\\%p, and 3.90\\%p higher on average than the baseline on split CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet, respectively.

To address data scarcity and imbalance in MPP, some studies have adopted Graph Neural Networks (GNN) as an encoder to extract commonalities from molecular graphs. However, these approaches often use a separate predictor for each task, neglecting the shared characteristics among predictors corresponding to different tasks. In response to this limitation, we introduce the GNN-MoCE architecture. It employs the Mixture of Collaborative Experts (MoCE) as predictors, exploiting task commonalities while confronting the homogeneity issue in the expert pool and the decision dominance dilemma within the expert group. To enhance expert diversity for collaboration among all experts, the Expert-Specific Projection method is proposed to assign a unique projection perspective to each expert. To balance decision-making influence for collaboration within the expert group, the Expert-Specific Loss is presented to integrate individual expert loss into the weighted decision loss of the group for more equitable training. Benefiting from the enhancements of MoCE in expert creation, dynamic expert group formation, and experts' collaboration, our model demonstrates superior performance over traditional methods on 24 MPP datasets, especially in tasks with limited data or high imbalance.

These enterprises are increasingly constructing data platforms, which are integrated suites of technology solutions architected for the efficient management, processing, storage, and data analysis. It has become critical to design these data platforms with mechanisms that inherently support data privacy and security, particularly as they encounter the added complexity of safeguarding unstructured data types such as log files and text documents. Within this context, data masking stands out as a vital feature of data platform architecture. It proactively conceals sensitive elements, ensuring data privacy while preserving the information's value for business operations and analytics. This protective measure entails a strategic two-fold process: firstly, accurately pinpointing the sensitive data that necessitates concealment, and secondly, applying sophisticated methods to disguise that data effectively within the data platform infrastructure. This research delves into the nuances of embedding advanced data masking techniques within the very fabric of data platforms and an in-depth exploration of how enterprises can adopt a comprehensive approach toward effective data masking implementation by exploring different identification and anonymization techniques.

Singularly perturbed boundary value problems present a significant challenge due to the presence of sharp boundary layers in their solutions. Additionally, the considered domain exhibits characteristic points, giving rise to a degenerate boundary layer problem. The stiffness of the problem is attributed to the sharp singular layers, which can result in substantial computational errors if not appropriately addressed. Traditional numerical methods typically require extensive mesh refinements near the boundary to achieve accurate solutions, which can be computationally expensive. To address the challenges posed by singularly perturbed problems, we employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). However, PINNs may struggle with rapidly varying singularly perturbed solutions over a small domain region, leading to inadequate resolution and potentially inaccurate or unstable results. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a semi-analytic method that augments PINNs with singular layers or corrector functions. Through our numerical experiments, we demonstrate significant improvements in both accuracy and stability, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach. ",

Thus, data augmentation has been introduced as a critical strategy to train deep learning models. However, data augmentation suffers from information loss and poor performance in small sample environments. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a feature augmentation method based on shape space theory, i.e., Geodesic curve feature augmentation, called GCFA in brevity. First, we extract features from the image with the neural network model. Then, the multiple image features are projected into a pre-shape space as features. In the pre-shape space, a Geodesic curve is built to fit the features. Finally, the many generated features on the Geodesic curve are used to train the various machine learning models. The GCFA module can be seamlessly integrated with most machine learning methods. And the proposed method is simple, effective and insensitive for the small sample datasets. Several examples demonstrate that the GCFA method can greatly improve the performance of the data preprocessing model in a small sample environment. ",

    "abstract": "Given an object of interest, visual navigation aims to reach the object's location based on a sequence of partial observations. To this end, an agent needs to 1) learn a piece of certain knowledge about the relations of object categories in the world during training and 2) look for the target object based on the pre-learned object category relations and its moving trajectory in the current unseen environment. In this paper, we propose a Category Relation Graph (CRG) to learn the knowledge of object category layout relations and a Temporal-Spatial-Region (TSR) attention architecture to perceive the long-term spatial-temporal dependencies of objects helping the navigation. We learn prior knowledge of object layout, establishing a category relationship graph to deduce the positions of specific objects. Subsequently, we introduced TSR to capture the relationships of objects in temporal, spatial, and regions within the observation trajectories. Specifically, we propose a Temporal attention module (T) to model the temporal structure of the observation sequence, which implicitly encodes the historical moving or trajectory information. Then, a Spatial attention module (S) is used to uncover the spatial context of the current observation objects based on the category relation graph and past observations. Last, a Region attention module (R) shifts the attention to the target-relevant region. Based on the visual representation extracted by our method, the agent can better perceive the environment and easily learn superior navigation policy. Experiments on AI2-THOR demonstrate our CRG-TSR method significantly outperforms existing methods regarding both effectiveness and efficiency.

However, manual labeling of point cloud data is laborious and time-consuming. Self-supervised representation learning can address the aforementioned issue by learning robust and generalized representations from unlabeled datasets. Nevertheless, the embedded features obtained by representation learning usually contain redundant information, and most current methods reduce feature redundancy by linear correlation constraints. In this paper, we propose PointJEM, a self-supervised representation learning method applied to the point cloud field. PointJEM comprises an embedding scheme and a loss function based on joint entropy. The embedding scheme divides the embedding vector into different parts, each part can learn a distinctive feature. To reduce redundant information in the features, PointJEM maximizes the joint entropy between the different parts, thereby rendering the learned feature variables pairwise independent. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted experiments on multiple datasets. The results demonstrate that our method can significantly reduce feature redundancy beyond linear correlation. Furthermore, PointJEM achieves competitive performance in downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation. ",

By building graphs at the scene level, object level, and grasp point level, GraNet enhances feature embedding at multiple scales while progressively converging to the ideal grasping locations by learning. Our pipeline can thus characterize the spatial distribution of grasps in cluttered scenes, leading to a higher rate of effective grasping. Furthermore, we enhance the representation ability of scalable graph networks by a structure-aware attention mechanism to exploit local relations in graphs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale GraspNet-1Billion benchmark, especially in grasping unseen objects (+11.62 AP).

However, the irregularity of point cloud data makes manual annotation time-consuming and laborious. Self-supervised representation learning, which leverages the intrinsic structure of large-scale unlabelled data to learn meaningful feature representations, has attracted increasing attention in the field of point cloud research. However, self-supervised representation learning often suffers from model collapse, resulting in reduced information and diversity of the learned representation, and consequently degrading the performance of downstream tasks. To address this problem, we propose PointMoment, a novel framework for point cloud self-supervised representation learning that utilizes a high-order mixed moment loss function rather than the conventional contrastive loss function. Moreover, our framework does not require any special techniques such as asymmetric network architectures, gradient stopping, etc. Specifically, we calculate the high-order mixed moment of the feature variables and force them to decompose into products of their individual moment, thereby making multiple variables more independent and minimizing the feature redundancy. We also incorporate a contrastive learning approach to maximize the feature invariance under different data augmentations of the same point cloud. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous unsupervised learning methods on the downstream task of 3D point cloud classification and segmentation. ",

In this paper, we specifically focus on controlling the heating system of a residential building to optimize its energy consumption while respecting user's thermal comfort. Recent works in this area have mainly focused on either model-based control, e.g., model predictive control (MPC), or model-free reinforcement learning (RL) to implement practical DR algorithms. A specific RL method that recently has achieved impressive success in domains such as board games (go, chess) is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Yet, for building control it has remained largely unexplored. Thus, we study MCTS specifically for building demand response. Its natural structure allows a flexible optimization that implicitly integrate exogenous constraints (as opposed, for example, to conventional RL solutions), making MCTS a promising candidate for DR control problems. We demonstrate how to improve MCTS control performance by incorporating a Physics-informed Neural Network (PiNN) model for its underlying thermal state prediction, as opposed to traditional purely data-driven Black-Box approaches. Our MCTS implementation aligned with a PiNN model is able to obtain a 3% increment of the obtained reward compared to a rule-based controller; leading to a 10% cost reduction and 35% reduction on temperature difference with the desired one when applied to an artificial price profile. We further implemented a Deep Learning layer into the Monte Carlo Tree Search technique using a neural network that leads the tree search through more optimal nodes. We then compared this addition with its Vanilla version, showing the improvement in computational cost required. ",

Due to the complex branch morphological structure of trees themselves and the occlusions from tree stems, branches and foliage, it is difficult to recreate a complete three-dimensional tree model from a two-dimensional image by conventional photogrammetric methods. In this study, based on tree images collected by various cameras in different ways, the Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) method was used for individual tree reconstruction and the exported point cloud models are compared with point cloud derived from photogrammetric reconstruction and laser scanning methods. The results show that the NeRF method performs well in individual tree 3D reconstruction, as it has higher successful reconstruction rate, better reconstruction in the canopy area, it requires less amount of images as input. Compared with photogrammetric reconstruction method, NeRF has significant advantages in reconstruction efficiency and is adaptable to complex scenes, but the generated point cloud tends to be noisy and low resolution. The accuracy of tree structural parameters (tree height and diameter at breast height) extracted from the photogrammetric point cloud is still higher than those of derived from the NeRF point cloud. The results of this study illustrate the great potential of NeRF method for individual tree reconstruction, and it provides new ideas and research directions for 3D reconstruction and visualization of complex forest scenes.

To learn geometric structure of complex matrix, we propose a Riemannian complex matrix convolution network for PolSAR image classification in Riemannian space for the first time, which directly utilizes the complex matrix as the network input and defines the Riemannian operations to learn complex matrix's features. The proposed Riemannian complex matrix convolution network considers PolSAR complex matrix endowed in Riemannian manifold, and defines a series of new Riemannian convolution, ReLu and LogEig operations in Riemannian space, which breaks through the Euclidean constraint of conventional networks. Then, a CNN module is appended to enhance contextual Riemannian features. Besides, a fast kernel learning method is developed for the proposed method to learn class-specific features and reduce the computation time effectively. Experiments are conducted on three sets of real PolSAR data with different bands and sensors. Experiments results demonstrates the proposed method can obtain superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods. ",

    "abstract": "The recent theoretical analysis of deep neural networks in their infinite-width limits has deepened our understanding of initialisation, feature learning, and training of those networks, and brought new practical techniques for finding appropriate hyperparameters, learning network weights, and performing inference. In this paper, we broaden this line of research by showing that this infinite-width analysis can be extended to the Jacobian of a deep neural network. We show that a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and its Jacobian at initialisation jointly converge to a Gaussian process (GP) as the widths of the MLP's hidden layers go to infinity and characterise this GP. We also prove that in the infinite-width limit, the evolution of the MLP under the so-called robust training (i.e., training with a regulariser on the Jacobian) is described by a linear first-order ordinary differential equation that is determined by a variant of the Neural Tangent Kernel. We experimentally show the relevance of our theoretical claims to wide finite networks, and empirically analyse the properties of kernel regression solution to obtain an insight into Jacobian regularisation.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, it is common to release audio content to the public. However, with the rise of voice cloning technology, attackers have the potential to easily impersonate a specific person by utilizing his publicly released audio without any permission. Therefore, it becomes significant to detect any potential misuse of the released audio content and protect its timbre from being impersonated. To this end, we introduce a novel concept, \"Timbre Watermarking\", which embeds watermark information into the target individual's speech, eventually defeating the voice cloning attacks. To ensure the watermark is robust to the voice cloning model's learning process, we design an end-to-end voice cloning-resistant detection framework. The core idea of our solution is to embed and extract the watermark in the frequency domain in a temporally invariant manner. To acquire generalization across different voice cloning attacks, we modulate their shared process and integrate it into our framework as a distortion layer. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed timbre watermarking can defend against different voice cloning attacks, exhibit strong resistance against various adaptive attacks (e.g., reconstruction-based removal attacks, watermark overwriting attacks), and achieve practicality in real-world services such as PaddleSpeech, Voice-Cloning-App, and so-vits-svc. In addition, ablation studies are also conducted to verify the effectiveness of our design. Some audio samples are available at https://timbrewatermarking.github.io/samples. ",

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks, representing an emerging threat to the integrity of deep neural networks, have garnered significant attention due to their ability to compromise deep learning systems clandestinely. While numerous backdoor attacks occur within the digital realm, their practical implementation in real-world prediction systems remains limited and vulnerable to disturbances in the physical world. Consequently, this limitation has given rise to the development of physical backdoor attacks, where trigger objects manifest as physical entities within the real world. However, creating the requisite dataset to train or evaluate a physical backdoor model is a daunting task, limiting the backdoor researchers and practitioners from studying such physical attack scenarios. This paper unleashes a recipe that empowers backdoor researchers to effortlessly create a malicious, physical backdoor dataset based on advances in generative modeling. Particularly, this recipe involves 3 automatic modules: suggesting the suitable physical triggers, generating the poisoned candidate samples (either by synthesizing new samples or editing existing clean samples), and finally refining for the most plausible ones. As such, it effectively mitigates the perceived complexity associated with creating a physical backdoor dataset, transforming it from a daunting task into an attainable objective. Extensive experiment results show that datasets created by our \"recipe\" enable adversaries to achieve an impressive attack success rate on real physical world data and exhibit similar properties compared to previous physical backdoor attack studies. This paper offers researchers a valuable toolkit for studies of physical backdoors, all within the confines of their laboratories. ",

Recently, new variants also surpassed the usual drawback of baked-in illumination in neural representations, showing that static neural avatars can be relit in any environment. In this work we simultaneously tackle both the motion and illumination problem, proposing a new method for relightable and animatable neural heads.

    "abstract": "A bipartite graph extensively models relationships between real-world entities of two different types, such as user-product data in e-commerce. Such graph data are inherently becoming more and more streaming, entailing continuous insertions and deletions of edges. A butterfly (i.e., 2x2 bi-clique) is the smallest non-trivial cohesive structure that plays a crucial role. Counting such butterfly patterns in streaming bipartite graphs is a core problem in applications such as dense subgraph discovery and anomaly detection. Yet, existing approximate solutions consider insert-only streams and, thus, achieve very low accuracy in fully dynamic bipartite graph streams that involve both insertions and deletions of edges. Adapting them to consider deletions is not trivial either, because different sampling schemes and new accuracy analyses are required. In this paper, we propose Abacus, a novel approximate algorithm that counts butterflies in the presence of both insertions and deletions by utilizing sampling. We prove that Abacus always delivers unbiased estimates of low variance. Furthermore, we extend Abacus and devise a parallel mini-batch variant, namely, Parabacus, which counts butterflies in parallel. Parabacus counts butterflies in a load-balanced manner using versioned samples, which results in significant speedup and is thus ideal for critical applications in the streaming environment. We evaluate Abacus/Parabacus using a diverse set of real bipartite graphs and assess its performance in terms of accuracy, throughput, and speedup. The results indicate that our proposal is the first capable of efficiently providing accurate butterfly counts in the most generic setting, i.e., a fully dynamic graph streaming environment that entails both insertions and deletions. It does so without sacrificing throughput and even improving it with the parallel version. ",

    "abstract": "Image-based crop growth modeling can substantially contribute to precision agriculture by revealing spatial crop development over time, which allows an early and location-specific estimation of relevant future plant traits, such as leaf area or biomass. A prerequisite for realistic and sharp crop image generation is the integration of multiple growth-influencing conditions in a model, such as an image of an initial growth stage, the associated growth time, and further information about the field treatment. We present a two-stage framework consisting first of an image prediction model and second of a growth estimation model, which both are independently trained. The image prediction model is a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network (CWGAN). In the generator of this model, conditional batch normalization (CBN) is used to integrate different conditions along with the input image. This allows the model to generate time-varying artificial images dependent on multiple influencing factors of different kinds. These images are used by the second part of the framework for plant phenotyping by deriving plant-specific traits and comparing them with those of non-artificial (real) reference images. For various crop datasets, the framework allows realistic, sharp image predictions with a slight loss of quality from short-term to long-term predictions. Simulations of varying growth-influencing conditions performed with the trained framework provide valuable insights into how such factors relate to crop appearances, which is particularly useful in complex, less explored crop mixture systems. Further results show that adding process-based simulated biomass as a condition increases the accuracy of the derived phenotypic traits from the predicted images. This demonstrates the potential of our framework to serve as an interface between an image- and process-based crop growth model. ",

Motivated by recent works on dynamic neural networks, we propose a simple way to train a large network and flexibly extract a subnetwork from it given a model size or complexity constraint during inference. We introduce a new way to allow a large model to be trained with dynamic depth and width during the training phase, and after the large model is trained we can select a subnetwork from it with arbitrary depth and width during the inference phase with a relatively better performance compared to training the subnetwork independently from scratch. Experiment results on a music source separation model show that our proposed method can effectively improve the separation performance across different subnetwork sizes and complexities with a single large model, and training the large model takes significantly shorter time than training all the different subnetworks.

Due to the characteristics of ORSIs, ORSI-SOD is full of challenges, such as multiple objects, small objects, low illuminations, and irregular shapes. To address these challenges, we propose a concise yet effective Texture-Semantic Collaboration Network (TSCNet) to explore the collaboration of texture cues and semantic cues for ORSI-SOD. Specifically, TSCNet is based on the generic encoder-decoder structure. In addition to the encoder and decoder, TSCNet includes a vital Texture-Semantic Collaboration Module (TSCM), which performs valuable feature modulation and interaction on basic features extracted from the encoder. The main idea of our TSCM is to make full use of the texture features at the lowest level and the semantic features at the highest level to achieve the expression enhancement of salient regions on features. In the TSCM, we first enhance the position of potential salient regions using semantic features. Then, we render and restore the object details using the texture features. Meanwhile, we also perceive regions of various scales, and construct interactions between different regions. Thanks to the perfect combination of TSCM and generic structure, our TSCNet can take care of both the position and details of salient objects, effectively handling various scenes. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our TSCNet achieves competitive performance compared to 14 state-of-the-art methods.

However, training these models can incur significant expenses, often requiring tens of thousands of GPUs for months of continuous operation. Typically, this training is carried out in specialized GPU clusters equipped with homogeneous high-speed Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) network interface cards (NICs). The acquisition and maintenance of such dedicated clusters is challenging. Current LLM training frameworks, like Megatron-LM and Megatron-DeepSpeed, focus primarily on optimizing training within homogeneous cluster settings. In this paper, we introduce Holmes, a training framework for LLMs that employs thoughtfully crafted data and model parallelism strategies over the heterogeneous NIC environment. Our primary technical contribution lies in a novel scheduling method that intelligently allocates distinct computational tasklets in LLM training to specific groups of GPU devices based on the characteristics of their connected NICs. Furthermore, our proposed framework, utilizing pipeline parallel techniques, demonstrates scalability to multiple GPU clusters, even in scenarios without high-speed interconnects between nodes in distinct clusters. We conducted comprehensive experiments that involved various scenarios in the heterogeneous NIC environment. In most cases, our framework achieves performance levels close to those achievable with homogeneous RDMA-capable networks (InfiniBand or RoCE), significantly exceeding training efficiency within the pure Ethernet environment. Additionally, we verified that our framework outperforms other mainstream LLM frameworks under heterogeneous NIC environment in terms of training efficiency and can be seamlessly integrated with them.

The presented architecture employs a two-level transformer encoder to effectively capture both global and local feature representation from the input images. These complimentary bi-level features are exploited for efficient document image binarization, resulting in improved results for system-generated as well as handwritten document images in a comprehensive approach. With the absence of convolutional layers, the transformer encoder uses the pixel patches and sub-patches along with their positional information to operate directly on them, while the decoder generates a clean (binarized) output image from the latent representation of the patches. Instead of using a simple vision transformer block to extract information from the image patches, the proposed architecture uses two transformer blocks for greater coverage of the extracted feature space on a global and local scale. The encoded feature representation is used by the decoder block to generate the corresponding binarized output. Extensive experiments on a variety of DIBCO and H-DIBCO benchmarks show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on four metrics.

    "abstract": "Cybersecurity in building energy management is crucial for protecting infrastructure, ensuring data integrity, and preventing unauthorized access or manipulation. This paper investigates the energy efficiency and cybersecurity of building energy management systems (BMS) against false data injection (FDI) attacks using proportional-integral (PI) and model predictive control (MPC) methods. Focusing on a commercial building model with five rooms, vulnerability of PI-based BMS and nonlinear MPC-based BMS against FDIs on sensors and actuators is studied. The study aims to assess the effectiveness of these control strategies in maintaining system performance and lifespan, highlighting the potential of MPC in enhancing system resilience against cyber threats. Our case studies demonstrate that even a short term FDIA can cause a 12% reduction in lifetime of a heat-pump under an MPC controller, and cause a near thirty-fold overuse of flow valves under a PI controller.

With the emergence of machine learning models, CAMD score functions may be replaced by various surrogates to automatically learn the structure-property relationships. Due to their outstanding performance on graph domains, graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently appeared frequently in CAMD. But using GNNs introduces new optimization challenges. This paper formulates GNNs using mixed-integer programming and then integrates this GNN formulation into the optimization and machine learning toolkit OMLT. To characterize and formulate molecules, we inherit the well-established mixed-integer optimization formulation for CAMD and propose symmetry-breaking constraints to remove symmetric solutions caused by graph isomorphism. In two case studies, we investigate fragment-based odorant molecular design with more practical requirements to test the compatibility and performance of our approaches. ",

In this work, we explore the possibility of making these interactions more natural by eliminating the need for a trigger phrase. Our goal is to determine whether a user addressed the virtual assistant based on signals obtained from the streaming audio recorded by the device microphone. We address this task by combining 1-best hypotheses and decoder signals from an automatic speech recognition system with acoustic representations from an audio encoder as input features to a large language model (LLM). In particular, we are interested in data and resource efficient systems that require only a small amount of training data and can operate in scenarios with only a single frozen LLM available on a device. For this reason, our model is trained on 80k or less examples of multimodal data using a combination of low-rank adaptation and prefix tuning. We compare the proposed system to unimodal baselines and show that the multimodal approach achieves lower equal-error-rates (EERs), while using only a fraction of the training data. We also show that low-dimensional specialized audio representations lead to lower EERs than high-dimensional general audio representations. ",

While independent learning in MARL offers flexibility and scalability, accurately assigning credit to individual agents in offline settings poses challenges due to partial observability and emergent behavior. Directly transferring the online credit assignment method to offline settings results in suboptimal outcomes due to the absence of real-time feedback and intricate agent interactions. Our approach, MACCA, characterizing the generative process as a Dynamic Bayesian Network, captures relationships between environmental variables, states, actions, and rewards. Estimating this model on offline data, MACCA can learn each agent's contribution by analyzing the causal relationship of their individual rewards, ensuring accurate and interpretable credit assignment. Additionally, the modularity of our approach allows it to seamlessly integrate with various offline MARL methods. Theoretically, we proved that under the setting of the offline dataset, the underlying causal structure and the function for generating the individual rewards of agents are identifiable, which laid the foundation for the correctness of our modeling. Experimentally, we tested MACCA in two environments, including discrete and continuous action settings. The results show that MACCA outperforms SOTA methods and improves performance upon their backbones. ",

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are among the most promising algorithms but they are slow, often achieve poor classification in the field and typically require large training data sets. Our objective was to design CNNs that are fast at inference time and achieve good classification performance while learning from moderate-sized data. Recordings from a rainforest ecosystem were used. Start and end-point of sounds from 20 bird species were manually annotated. Spectrograms from 10 second segments were used as CNN input. We designed simple CNNs with a frequency unwrapping layer (SIMP-FU models) such that any output unit was connected to all spectrogram frequencies but only to a sub-region of time, the Receptive Field (RF). Our models allowed experimentation with different RF durations. Models either used the time-indexed labels that encode start and end-point of sounds or simpler segment-level labels. Models learning from time-indexed labels performed considerably better than their segment-level counterparts. Best classification performances was achieved for models with intermediate RF duration of 1.5 seconds. The best SIMP-FU models achieved AUCs over 0.95 in 18 of 20 classes on the test set. On compact low-cost hardware the best SIMP-FU models evaluated up to seven times faster than real-time data acquisition. RF duration was a major driver of classification performance. The optimum of 1.5 s was in the same range as the duration of the sounds. Our models achieved good classification performance while learning from moderate-sized training data. This is explained by the usage of time-indexed labels during training and adequately sized RF. Results confirm the feasibility of deploying small CNNs with good classification performance on compact low-cost devices. ",

In this paper, we present a circuit complexity analysis for relational neural networks (such as graph neural networks and transformers) representing policies for planning problems, by drawing connections with serialized goal regression search (S-GRS). We show that there are three general classes of planning problems, in terms of the growth of circuit width and depth as a function of the number of objects and planning horizon, providing constructive proofs.

We derive theoretical bounds on the number of triangles and other short-length cycles producible by each level of the hierarchy, contingent on the model overlap. We provide instances demonstrating the asymptotic optimality of our bounds. Furthermore, we introduce new generative models for each of the three hierarchical levels, leveraging dense subgraph discovery (Gionis & Tsourakakis, 2015). Our evaluation, conducted on real-world datasets, focuses on assessing the output quality and overlap of our proposed models in comparison to other popular models. Our results indicate that our simple, interpretable models provide competitive baselines to popular generative models.

    "abstract": "Networks in machine learning offer examples of complex high-dimensional dynamical systems reminiscent of biological systems. Here, we study the learning dynamics of Generalized Hopfield networks, which permit a visualization of internal memories. These networks have been shown to proceed through a 'feature-to-prototype' transition, as the strength of network nonlinearity is increased, wherein the learned, or terminal, states of internal memories transition from mixed to pure states. Focusing on the prototype learning dynamics of the internal memories we observe a strong resemblance to the canalized, or low-dimensional, dynamics of cells as they differentiate within a Waddingtonian landscape. Dynamically, we demonstrate that learning in a Generalized Hopfield Network proceeds through sequential 'splits' in memory space. Furthermore, order of splitting is interpretable and reproducible. The dynamics between the splits are canalized in the Waddington sense -- robust to variations in detailed aspects of the system. In attempting to make the analogy a rigorous equivalence, we study smaller subsystems that exhibit similar properties to the full system. We combine analytical calculations with numerical simulations to study the dynamical emergence of the feature-to-prototype transition, and the behaviour of splits in the landscape, saddles points, visited during learning. We exhibit regimes where saddles appear and disappear through saddle-node bifurcations, qualitatively changing the distribution of learned memories as the strength of the nonlinearity is varied -- allowing us to systematically investigate the mechanisms that underlie the emergence of Waddingtonian dynamics. Memories can thus differentiate in a predictive and controlled way, revealing new bridges between experimental biology, dynamical systems theory, and machine learning. ",

Most existing methods require experimentally determined protein holo-structures as input. However, such structures can be unavailable on novel or less-studied proteins. To tackle this limitation, we propose LaMPSite, which only takes protein sequences and ligand molecular graphs as input for ligand binding site predictions. The protein sequences are used to retrieve residue-level embeddings and contact maps from the pre-trained ESM-2 protein language model. The ligand molecular graphs are fed into a graph neural network to compute atom-level embeddings. Then we compute and update the protein-ligand interaction embedding based on the protein residue-level embeddings and ligand atom-level embeddings, and the geometric constraints in the inferred protein contact map and ligand distance map. A final pooling on protein-ligand interaction embedding would indicate which residues belong to the binding sites. Without any 3D coordinate information of proteins, our proposed model achieves competitive performance compared to baseline methods that require 3D protein structures when predicting binding sites. Given that less than 50% of proteins have reliable structure information in the current stage, LaMPSite will provide new opportunities for drug discovery. ",

    "abstract": "We study stochastic Nash equilibrium problems subject to heterogeneous uncertainty on the cost functions of the individual agents. In our setting, we assume no prior knowledge of the underlying probability distribution of the uncertain variables. Adopting a data-driven distributionally robust approach, based on the so-called Wasserstein metric, where each agent constructs their own ambiguity set, we provide, under mild assumptions, finite sample guarantees on the probability that the data-driven distributionally robust Nash equilibrium is also robust with respect to the true probability distributions with high confidence. Furthermore, by recasting the game as a distributionally robust variational inequality, under appropriate conditions, we establish almost sure asymptotic convergence of the set of data-driven distributionally robust equilibria to the solution set of the original game. Finally, we recast the distributionally robust Nash game as a finite-dimensional Nash equilibrium problem. We illustrate the proposed distributionally robust reformulation via numerical experiments of stochastic Nash-Cournot games. ",

    "abstract": "In causal models, a given mechanism is assumed to be invariant to changes of other mechanisms. While this principle has been utilized for inference in settings where the causal variables are observed, theoretical insights when the variables of interest are latent are largely missing. We assay the connection between invariance and causal representation learning by establishing impossibility results which show that invariance alone is insufficient to identify latent causal variables. Together with practical considerations, we use these theoretical findings to highlight the need for additional constraints in order to identify representations by exploiting invariance. ",

    "title": "Beyond discounted returns: Robust Markov decision processes with average  and Blackwell optimality",
    "abstract": "Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) are a widely used framework for sequential decision-making under parameter uncertainty. RMDPs have been extensively studied when the objective is to maximize the discounted return, but little is known for average optimality (optimizing the long-run average of the rewards obtained over time) and Blackwell optimality (remaining discount optimal for all discount factors sufficiently close to 1). In this paper, we prove several foundational results for RMDPs beyond the discounted return. We show that average optimal policies can be chosen stationary and deterministic for sa-rectangular RMDPs but, perhaps surprisingly, that history-dependent (Markovian) policies strictly outperform stationary policies for average optimality in s-rectangular RMDPs. We also study Blackwell optimality for sa-rectangular RMDPs, where we show that {\\em approximate} Blackwell optimal policies always exist, although Blackwell optimal policies may not exist. We also provide a sufficient condition for their existence, which encompasses virtually any examples from the literature. We then discuss the connection between average and Blackwell optimality, and we describe several algorithms to compute the optimal average return. Interestingly, our approach leverages the connections between RMDPs and stochastic games. ",

    "abstract": "The vast majority of standard image and video content available online is represented in display-encoded color spaces, in which pixel values are conveniently scaled to a limited range (0-1) and the color distribution is approximately perceptually uniform. In contrast, both camera RAW and high dynamic range (HDR) images are often represented in linear color spaces, in which color values are linearly related to colorimetric quantities of light. While training on commonly available display-encoded images is a well-established practice, there is no consensus on how neural networks should be trained for tasks on RAW and HDR images in linear color spaces. In this work, we test several approaches on three popular image restoration applications: denoising, deblurring, and single-image super-resolution. We examine whether HDR/RAW images need to be display-encoded using popular transfer functions (PQ, PU21, mu-law), or whether it is better to train in linear color spaces, but use loss functions that correct for perceptual non-uniformity. Our results indicate that neural networks train significantly better on HDR and RAW images represented in display-encoded color spaces, which offer better perceptual uniformity than linear spaces. This small change to the training strategy can bring a very substantial gain in performance, up to 10-15 dB. ",

    "abstract": "We present a novel machine-learning approach for detecting faint point sources in high-contrast adaptive optics imaging datasets. The most widely used algorithms for primary subtraction aim to decouple bright stellar speckle noise from planetary signatures by subtracting an approximation of the temporally evolving stellar noise from each frame in an imaging sequence. Our approach aims to improve the stellar noise approximation and increase the planet detection sensitivity by leveraging deep learning in a novel direct imaging post-processing algorithm. We show that a convolutional autoencoder neural network, trained on an extensive reference library of real imaging sequences, accurately reconstructs the stellar speckle noise at the location of a potential planet signal. This tool is used in a post-processing algorithm we call Direct Exoplanet Detection with Convolutional Image Reconstruction, or ConStruct. The reliability and sensitivity of ConStruct are assessed using real Keck/NIRC2 angular differential imaging datasets. Of the 30 unique point sources we examine, ConStruct yields a higher S/N than traditional PCA-based processing for 67$\\%$ of the cases and improves the relative contrast by up to a factor of 2.6. This work demonstrates the value and potential of deep learning to take advantage of a diverse reference library of point spread function realizations to improve direct imaging post-processing. ConStruct and its future improvements may be particularly useful as tools for post-processing high-contrast images from the James Webb Space Telescope and extreme adaptive optics instruments, both for the current generation and those being designed for the upcoming 30 meter-class telescopes.
