    "abstract": "Autonomous landing of UAVs in high sea states requires the UAV to land exclusively during the ship deck's \"rest period,\" coinciding with minimal movement. Given this scenario, determining the ship's \"rest period\" based on its movement patterns becomes a fundamental prerequisite for addressing this challenge. This study employs the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict the ship's motion across three dimensions: longi-tudinal, transverse, and vertical waves. In the absence of actual ship data under high sea states, this paper employs a composite sine wave model to simulate ship deck motion. Through this approach, a highly accurate model is established, exhibiting promising outcomes within various stochastic sine wave combination models. ",

    "abstract": "Currently, sample-specific backdoor attacks (SSBAs) are the most advanced and malicious methods since they can easily circumvent most of the current backdoor defenses. In this paper, we reveal that SSBAs are not sufficiently stealthy due to their poisoned-label nature, where users can discover anomalies if they check the image-label relationship. In particular, we demonstrate that it is ineffective to directly generalize existing SSBAs to their clean-label variants by poisoning samples solely from the target class. We reveal that it is primarily due to two reasons, including \\textbf{(1)} the `antagonistic effects' of ground-truth features and \\textbf{(2)} the learning difficulty of sample-specific features. Accordingly, trigger-related features of existing SSBAs cannot be effectively learned under the clean-label setting due to their mild trigger intensity required for ensuring stealthiness. We argue that the intensity constraint of existing SSBAs is mostly because their trigger patterns are `content-irrelevant' and therefore act as `noises' for both humans and DNNs. Motivated by this understanding, we propose to exploit content-relevant features, $a.k.a.$ (human-relied) attributes, as the trigger patterns to design clean-label SSBAs. This new attack paradigm is dubbed backdoor attack with attribute trigger (BAAT). Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, which verify the effectiveness of our BAAT and its resistance to existing defenses. ",

By utilizing data poisoning methods, such as backdoor or label-flipping attacks, or by sending manipulated information about their data back to the server, malicious clients are able to corrupt the global model and degrade performance across all clients within a federation. Our novel aggregation method, FedBayes, mitigates the effect of a malicious client by calculating the probabilities of a client's model weights given to the prior model's weights using Bayesian statistics. Our results show that this approach negates the effects of malicious clients and protects the overall federation. ",

    "abstract": "Massive MIMO systems are typically designed assuming linear power amplifiers (PAs). However, PAs are most energy efficient close to saturation, where non-linear distortion arises. For conventional precoders, this distortion can coherently combine at user locations, limiting performance. We propose a graph neural network (GNN) to learn a mapping between channel and precoding matrices, which maximizes the sum rate affected by non-linear distortion, using a high-order polynomial PA model. In the distortion-limited regime, this GNN-based precoder outperforms zero forcing (ZF), ZF plus digital pre-distortion (DPD) and the distortion-aware beamforming (DAB) precoder from the state-of-the-art. At an input back-off of -3 dB the proposed precoder compared to ZF increases the sum rate by 8.60 and 8.84 bits/channel use for two and four users respectively. Radiation patterns show that these gains are achieved by transmitting the non-linear distortion in non-user directions. In the four user-case, for a fixed sum rate, the total consumed power (PA and processing) of the GNN precoder is 3.24 and 1.44 times lower compared to ZF and ZF plus DPD respectively. A complexity analysis shows six orders of magnitude reduction compared to DAB precoding. This opens perspectives to operate PAs closer to saturation, which drastically increases their energy efficiency. ",

We present a novel approach to exploit such a network for covert communication purposes, where controlled clusters encode the symbols spatio-temporally. The cluster synchronization network is divided into two subnetworks as transmitter and receiver. First, we specifically design the network whose controlled parameters reside in the transmitter. Second, we ensure that the nodes of the links connecting the transmitter and receiver are not in the same clusters for all the control parameters. The former condition ensures that the control parameters changed at the transmitter change the whole clustering scheme. The second condition enforces the transmitted signals are always continuous and chaotic. Hence, the transmitted signals are not modulated by the information directly, but distributed over the links connecting the subnetworks. The information cannot be deciphered by eavesdropping on the channel links without knowing the network topology. The performance has been assessed by extensive simulations of bit error rates under noisy channel conditions. ",

    "abstract": "A User Next Location Prediction (UNLP) task, which predicts the next location that a user will move to given his/her trajectory, is an indispensable task for a wide range of applications. Previous studies using large-scale trajectory datasets in a single server have achieved remarkable performance in UNLP task. However, in real-world applications, legal and ethical issues have been raised regarding privacy concerns leading to restrictions against sharing human trajectory datasets to any other server. In response, Federated Learning (FL) has emerged to address the personal privacy issue by collaboratively training multiple clients (i.e., users) and then aggregating them. While previous studies employed FL for UNLP, they are still unable to achieve reliable performance because of the heterogeneity of clients' mobility. To tackle this problem, we propose the Federated Learning for Geographic Information (FedGeo), a FL framework specialized for UNLP, which alleviates the heterogeneity of clients' mobility and guarantees personal privacy protection. Firstly, we incorporate prior global geographic adjacency information to the local client model, since the spatial correlation between locations is trained partially in each client who has only a heterogeneous subset of the overall trajectories in FL. We also introduce a novel aggregation method that minimizes the gap between client models to solve the problem of client drift caused by differences between client models when learning with their heterogeneous data. Lastly, we probabilistically exclude clients with extremely heterogeneous data from the FL process by focusing on clients who visit relatively diverse locations. We show that FedGeo is superior to other FL methods for model performance in UNLP task. We also validated our model in a real-world application using our own customers' mobile phones and the FL agent system. ",

Collision detection is vital to ensure the safe and stable operation of cooperative robots in productive activities. As an advanced geometric language, conformal geometric algebra can simplify the construction of the robot collision model and the calculation of collision distance. Compared with the formal method based on conformal geometric algebra, the traditional method may have some defects which are difficult to find in the modelling and calculation. We use the formal method based on conformal geometric algebra to study the collision detection problem of cooperative robots. This paper builds formal models of geometric primitives and the robot body based on the conformal geometric algebra library in HOL Light. We analyse the shortest distance between geometric primitives and prove their collision determination conditions. Based on the above contents, we construct a formal verification framework for the robot collision detection method. By the end of this paper, we apply the proposed framework to collision detection between two single-arm industrial cooperative robots. The flexibility and reliability of the proposed framework are verified by constructing a general collision model and a special collision model for two single-arm industrial cooperative robots. ",

    "abstract": "An increasing number of related urban data sources have brought forth novel opportunities for learning urban region representations, i.e., embeddings. The embeddings describe latent features of urban regions and enable discovering similar regions for urban planning applications. Existing methods learn an embedding for a region using every different type of region feature data, and subsequently fuse all learned embeddings of a region to generate a unified region embedding. However, these studies often overlook the significance of the fusion process. The typical fusion methods rely on simple aggregation, such as summation and concatenation, thereby disregarding correlations within the fused region embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a novel model named HAFusion. Our model is powered by a dual-feature attentive fusion module named DAFusion, which fuses embeddings from different region features to learn higher-order correlations between the regions as well as between the different types of region features. DAFusion is generic - it can be integrated into existing models to enhance their fusion process. Further, motivated by the effective fusion capability of an attentive module, we propose a hybrid attentive feature learning module named HALearning to enhance the embedding learning from each individual type of region features. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model HAFusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods across three different prediction tasks. Using our learned region embedding leads to consistent and up to 31% improvements in the prediction accuracy. ",

    "abstract": "Detecting abnormal driving behavior is critical for road traffic safety and the evaluation of drivers' behavior. With the advancement of machine learning (ML) algorithms and the accumulation of naturalistic driving data, many ML models have been adopted for abnormal driving behavior detection. Most existing ML-based detectors rely on (fully) supervised ML methods, which require substantial labeled data. However, ground truth labels are not always available in the real world, and labeling large amounts of data is tedious. Thus, there is a need to explore unsupervised or semi-supervised methods to make the anomaly detection process more feasible and efficient. To fill this research gap, this study analyzes large-scale real-world data revealing several abnormal driving behaviors (e.g., sudden acceleration, rapid lane-changing) and develops a Hierarchical Extreme Learning Machines (HELM) based semi-supervised ML method using partly labeled data to accurately detect the identified abnormal driving behaviors. Moreover, previous ML-based approaches predominantly utilize basic vehicle motion features (such as velocity and acceleration) to label and detect abnormal driving behaviors, while this study seeks to introduce Surrogate Safety Measures (SSMs) as the input features for ML models to improve the detection performance. Results from extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised ML model with the introduced SSMs serving as important features. The proposed semi-supervised ML method outperforms other baseline semi-supervised or unsupervised methods regarding various metrics, e.g., delivering the best accuracy at 99.58% and the best F-1 measure at 0.9913. The ablation study further highlights the significance of SSMs for advancing detection performance. ",

    "abstract": "Much of the world's most valued data is stored in relational databases and data warehouses, where the data is organized into many tables connected by primary-foreign key relations. However, building machine learning models using this data is both challenging and time consuming. The core problem is that no machine learning method is capable of learning on multiple tables interconnected by primary-foreign key relations. Current methods can only learn from a single table, so the data must first be manually joined and aggregated into a single training table, the process known as feature engineering. Feature engineering is slow, error prone and leads to suboptimal models. Here we introduce an end-to-end deep representation learning approach to directly learn on data laid out across multiple tables. We name our approach Relational Deep Learning (RDL). The core idea is to view relational databases as a temporal, heterogeneous graph, with a node for each row in each table, and edges specified by primary-foreign key links. Message Passing Graph Neural Networks can then automatically learn across the graph to extract representations that leverage all input data, without any manual feature engineering. Relational Deep Learning leads to more accurate models that can be built much faster. To facilitate research in this area, we develop RelBench, a set of benchmark datasets and an implementation of Relational Deep Learning. The data covers a wide spectrum, from discussions on Stack Exchange to book reviews on the Amazon Product Catalog. Overall, we define a new research area that generalizes graph machine learning and broadens its applicability to a wide set of AI use cases. ",

Despite the appeal of this coverage guarantee, these sets may not be efficient: the size and contents of the prediction sets are not directly controlled, and instead depend on the underlying model and choice of score function. To remedy this, recent work has proposed learning model and score function parameters using data to directly optimize the efficiency of the ICP prediction sets. While appealing, the generalization theory for such an approach is lacking: direct optimization of empirical efficiency may yield prediction sets that are either no longer efficient on test data, or no longer obtain the required coverage on test data. In this work, we use PAC-Bayes theory to obtain generalization bounds on both the coverage and the efficiency of set-valued predictors which can be directly optimized to maximize efficiency while satisfying a desired test coverage. In contrast to prior work, our framework allows us to utilize the entire calibration dataset to learn the parameters of the model and score function, instead of requiring a separate hold-out set for obtaining test-time coverage guarantees. We leverage these theoretical results to provide a practical algorithm for using calibration data to simultaneously fine-tune the parameters of a model and score function while guaranteeing test-time coverage and efficiency of the resulting prediction sets. We evaluate the approach on regression and classification tasks, and outperform baselines calibrated using a Hoeffding bound-based PAC guarantee on ICP, especially in the low-data regime. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning models, while achieving remarkable performance across various tasks, are vulnerable to member inference attacks, wherein adversaries identify if a specific data point was part of a model's training set. This susceptibility raises substantial privacy concerns, especially when models are trained on sensitive datasets. Current defense methods often struggle to provide robust protection without hurting model utility, and they often require retraining the model or using extra data. In this work, we introduce a novel defense framework against membership attacks by leveraging generative models. The key intuition of our defense is to remove the differences between member and non-member inputs which can be used to perform membership attacks, by re-generating input samples before feeding them to the target model. Therefore, our defense works \\emph{pre-inference}, which is unlike prior defenses that are either training-time (modify the model) or post-inference time (modify the model's output). A unique feature of our defense is that it works on input samples only, without modifying the training or inference phase of the target model. Therefore, it can be cascaded with other defense mechanisms as we demonstrate through experiments. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our approach can serve as a robust plug-n-play defense mechanism, enhancing membership privacy without compromising model utility in both baseline and defended settings.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks' (GNNs) ability to generalize across complex distributions is crucial for real-world applications. However, prior research has primarily focused on specific types of distribution shifts, such as larger graph size, or inferred shifts from constructed data environments, which is highly limited when confronted with multiple and nuanced distribution shifts. For instance, in a social graph, a user node might experience increased interactions and content alterations, while other user nodes encounter distinct shifts. Neglecting such complexities significantly impedes generalization. To address it, we present GraphMETRO, a novel framework that enhances GNN generalization under complex distribution shifts in both node and graph-level tasks. Our approach employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with a gating model and expert models aligned in a shared representation space. The gating model identifies key mixture components governing distribution shifts, while each expert generates invariant representations w.r.t. a mixture component. Finally, GraphMETRO aggregates representations from multiple experts to generate the final invariant representation. Our experiments on synthetic and realworld datasets demonstrate GraphMETRO's superiority and interpretability. To highlight, GraphMETRO achieves state-of-the-art performances on four real-world datasets from GOOD benchmark, outperforming the best baselines on WebKB and Twitch datasets by 67% and 4.2%, respectively.

By assembling these switches into a network and manipulating charge transport dynamics through surrounding electrodes, the network can be reconfigurably functionalized to act as any Boolean logic gate. This work introduces a kinetic Monte Carlo-based simulation tool, applying established principles of single electronics to model charge transport dynamics in nanoparticle networks. We functionalize nanoparticle networks as Boolean logic gates and assess their quality using a fitness function. Based on the definition of fitness, we derive new metrics to quantify essential nonlinear properties of the network, including negative differential resistance and nonlinear separability. These nonlinear properties are crucial not only for functionalizing the network as Boolean logic gates but also when our networks are functionalized for brain-inspired computing applications in the future. We address fundamental questions about the dependence of fitness and nonlinear properties on system size, number of surrounding electrodes, and electrode positioning. We assert the overall benefit of having more electrodes, with proximity to the network's output being pivotal for functionality and nonlinearity. Additionally, we demonstrate a optimal system size and argue for breaking symmetry in electrode positioning to favor nonlinear properties. ",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), significant progress has been made in code generation, enabling LLMs to transform natural language into programming code. These Code LLMs have been widely accepted by massive users and organizations. However, a dangerous nature is hidden in the code, which is the existence of fatal vulnerabilities. While some LLM providers have attempted to address these issues by aligning with human guidance, these efforts fall short of making Code LLMs practical and robust. Without a deep understanding of the performance of the LLMs under the practical worst cases, it would be concerning to apply them to various real-world applications. In this paper, we answer the critical issue: Are existing Code LLMs immune to generating vulnerable code? If not, what is the possible maximum severity of this issue in practical deployment scenarios? In this paper, we introduce DeceptPrompt, a novel algorithm that can generate adversarial natural language instructions that drive the Code LLMs to generate functionality correct code with vulnerabilities. DeceptPrompt is achieved through a systematic evolution-based algorithm with a fine grain loss design. The unique advantage of DeceptPrompt enables us to find natural prefix/suffix with totally benign and non-directional semantic meaning, meanwhile, having great power in inducing the Code LLMs to generate vulnerable code. This feature can enable us to conduct the almost-worstcase red-teaming on these LLMs in a real scenario, where users are using natural language. Our extensive experiments and analyses on DeceptPrompt not only validate the effectiveness of our approach but also shed light on the huge weakness of LLMs in the code generation task. When applying the optimized prefix/suffix, the attack success rate (ASR) will improve by average 50% compared with no prefix/suffix applying. ",

In particular, recent efforts to release data streams, using the rigorous privacy notion of differential privacy (DP), have encountered issues with unbounded privacy leakage. This challenge limits their applicability to only a finite number of time slots (''finite data stream'') or relaxation to protecting the events (''event or $w$-event DP'') rather than all the records of users. A persistent challenge is managing the sensitivity of outputs to inputs in situations where users contribute many activities and data distributions evolve over time. In this paper, we present a novel technique for Differentially Private data streaming over Infinite disclosure (DPI) that effectively bounds the total privacy leakage of each user in infinite data streams while enabling accurate data collection and analysis. Furthermore, we also maximize the accuracy of DPI via a novel boosting mechanism. Finally, extensive experiments across various streaming applications and real datasets (e.g., COVID-19, Network Traffic, and USDA Production), show that DPI maintains high utility for infinite data streams in diverse settings.

To bridge this gap, we perform a comprehensive exploration of various poisoning techniques to assess their effectiveness across a range of generative tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a range of metrics designed to quantify the success and stealthiness of poisoning attacks specifically tailored to NLG tasks. Through extensive experiments on multiple NLG tasks, LLMs and datasets, we show that it is possible to successfully poison an LLM during the fine-tuning stage using as little as 1\\% of the total tuning data samples. Our paper presents the first systematic approach to comprehend poisoning attacks targeting NLG tasks considering a wide range of triggers and attack settings.

    "abstract": "Regularization is critical in solving the ill-posed geo-physical inversion problems. Explicit regularization is often used, but there are opportunities to explore the implicit regularization effect inherently from a Neural Network structure. Researchers in Computer Vision (CV) have discovered that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture inherently enforces a regularization that is advantageous for addressing diverse CV inverse problems, including de-noising and in-painting. In this study, we examine the applicability of this implicit regularization to geophysical inversions. The CNN maps an arbitrary vector to the model space (e.g. log-conductivity on the simulation mesh). The predicted subsurface model is then fed into a forward numerical simulation process to generate corresponding predicted measurements. Subsequently, the objective function value is computed by comparing these predicted measurements with the observed field measurements. The backpropagation algorithm is employed to update the trainable parameters of the CNN during the inversion. Note that the CNN in our proposed method does not require training before the inversion, rather, the CNN weights are estimated in the inversion algorithm, hence this is a test-time learning (TTL) approach. The results demonstrate that the implicit regularization provided by the CNN can be useful in DC resistivity inversions. We also provide a detailed discussion of the potential sources of this implicit regularization and some practical guides for applying the proposed method to other geophysical scenarios. The proposed approach for reparameterizing the inverse problem can be adapted to other Tikhonov-style geophysical inversions. ",

Furthermore, leveraging on the strong capability of foundation models (i.e., SAM and LLM), we propose to augment recipe and food image by extracting information related to the counterpart. SAM generates image segments corresponding to ingredients in the recipe, while LLM produces a visual imagination description from the recipe, aiming to capture the visual cues of a food image.

In this work, we propose MimicDiffusion, a new diffusion-based adversarial purification technique, that directly approximates the generative process of the diffusion model with the clean image as input. Concretely, we analyze the differences between the guided terms using the clean image and the adversarial sample. After that, we first implement MimicDiffusion based on Manhattan distance.

We utilize multiple types of knowledge as prefix-prompts of input for the encoder and decoder of NMT models to guide the translation process. The approach requires no changes to the model architecture and effectively adapts to domain-specific translation without retraining.

    "abstract": "The rapid development of graph neural networks (GNNs) encourages the rising of link prediction, achieving promising performance with various applications. Unfortunately, through a comprehensive analysis, we surprisingly find that current link predictors with dynamic negative samplers (DNSs) suffer from the migration phenomenon between \"easy\" and \"hard\" samples, which goes against the preference of DNS of choosing \"hard\" negatives, thus severely hindering capability. Towards this end, we propose the MeBNS framework, serving as a general plugin that can potentially improve current negative sampling based link predictors. In particular, we elaborately devise a Meta-learning Supported Teacher-student GNN (MST-GNN) that is not only built upon teacher-student architecture for alleviating the migration between \"easy\" and \"hard\" samples but also equipped with a meta learning based sample re-weighting module for helping the student GNN distinguish \"hard\" samples in a fine-grained manner. To effectively guide the learning of MST-GNN, we prepare a Structure enhanced Training Data Generator (STD-Generator) and an Uncertainty based Meta Data Collector (UMD-Collector) for supporting the teacher and student GNN, respectively. Extensive experiments show that the MeBNS achieves remarkable performance across six link prediction benchmark datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Identifying travelers' transportation modes is important in transportation science and location-based services. It's appealing for researchers to leverage GPS trajectory data to infer transportation modes with the popularity of GPS-enabled devices, e.g., smart phones. Existing studies frame this problem as classification task. The dominant two-stage studies divide the trip into single-one mode segments first and then categorize these segments. The over segmentation strategy and inevitable error propagation bring difficulties to classification stage and make optimizing the whole system hard. The recent one-stage works throw out trajectory segmentation entirely to avoid these by directly conducting point-wise classification for the trip, whereas leaving predictions dis-continuous. To solve above-mentioned problems, inspired by YOLO and SSD in object detection, we propose to reframe change point detection and segment classification as a unified regression task instead of the existing classification task. We directly regress coordinates of change points and classify associated segments. In this way, our method divides the trip into segments under a supervised manner and leverage more contextual information, obtaining predictions with high accuracy and continuity. Two frameworks, TrajYOLO and TrajSSD, are proposed to solve the regression task and various feature extraction backbones are exploited. Exhaustive experiments on GeoLife dataset show that the proposed method has competitive overall identification accuracy of 0.853 when distinguishing five modes: walk, bike, bus, car, train. As for change point detection, our method increases precision at the cost of drop in recall. All codes are available at https://github.com/RadetzkyLi/TrajYOLO-SSD. ",

To tackle this issue, we present Simultaneous Individual and Cooperative Perception (SiCP), a generic framework that supports a wide range of the state-of-the-art standalone perception backbones and enhances them with a novel Dual-Perception Network (DP-Net) designed to facilitate both individual and cooperative perception. In addition to its lightweight nature with only 0.13M parameters, DP-Net is robust and retains crucial gradient information during feature map fusion. As demonstrated in a comprehensive evaluation on the OPV2V dataset, thanks to DP-Net, SiCP surpasses state-of-the-art cooperative perception solutions while preserving the performance of standalone perception solutions.

    "abstract": "Entropy and mutual information in neural networks provide rich information on the learning process, but they have proven difficult to compute reliably in high dimensions. Indeed, in noisy and high-dimensional data, traditional estimates in ambient dimensions approach a fixed entropy and are prohibitively hard to compute. To address these issues, we leverage data geometry to access the underlying manifold and reliably compute these information-theoretic measures. Specifically, we define diffusion spectral entropy (DSE) in neural representations of a dataset as well as diffusion spectral mutual information (DSMI) between different variables representing data. First, we show that they form noise-resistant measures of intrinsic dimensionality and relationship strength in high-dimensional simulated data that outperform classic Shannon entropy, nonparametric estimation, and mutual information neural estimation (MINE). We then study the evolution of representations in classification networks with supervised learning, self-supervision, or overfitting. We observe that (1) DSE of neural representations increases during training; (2) DSMI with the class label increases during generalizable learning but stays stagnant during overfitting; (3) DSMI with the input signal shows differing trends: on MNIST it increases, while on CIFAR-10 and STL-10 it decreases. Finally, we show that DSE can be used to guide better network initialization and that DSMI can be used to predict downstream classification accuracy across 962 models on ImageNet.

First, we analyzed the dataset using three visualization techniques: t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

In this work, we propose a simple yet effective training framework called Structural Compression (StructComp) to address this issue. Inspired by a sparse low-rank approximation on the diffusion matrix, StructComp trains the encoder with the compressed nodes. This allows the encoder not to perform any message passing during the training stage, and significantly reduces the number of sample pairs in the contrastive loss. We theoretically prove that the original GCL loss can be approximated with the contrastive loss computed by StructComp. Moreover, StructComp can be regarded as an additional regularization term for GCL models, resulting in a more robust encoder. Empirical studies on seven benchmark datasets show that StructComp greatly reduces the time and memory consumption while improving model performance compared to the vanilla GCL models and scalable training methods.

Through this approach, we have achieved competitive or even better results while maintaining extremely low resource consumption across six change detection benchmarks. For example, training time on LEVIR-CD, a change detection benchmark, is only half an hour with 9 GB memory usage, which could be very convenient for most researchers. Additionally, the decoupled tuning framework can be extended to any pretrained model for semantic change detection and multi temporal change detection as well. We hope that our proposed approach will serve as a part of foundational model to inspire more unified training approaches on change detection in the future. ",

Adversarial training, which has been shown to be one of the most effective defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks in computer vision, holds great promise for enhancing the robustness of GNNs. There is limited research on defending against attacks by performing adversarial training on graphs, and it is crucial to delve deeper into this approach to optimize its effectiveness. Therefore, based on robust adversarial training on graphs, we propose a hierarchical constraint refinement framework (HC-Ref) that enhances the anti-perturbation capabilities of GNNs and downstream classifiers separately, ultimately leading to improved robustness. We propose corresponding adversarial regularization terms that are conducive to adaptively narrowing the domain gap between the normal part and the perturbation part according to the characteristics of different layers, promoting the smoothness of the predicted distribution of both parts. Moreover, existing research on graph robust adversarial training primarily concentrates on training from the standpoint of node feature perturbations and seldom takes into account alterations in the graph structure. This limitation makes it challenging to prevent attacks based on topological changes in the graph. This paper generates adversarial examples by utilizing graph structure perturbations, offering an effective approach to defend against attack methods that are based on topological changes. Extensive experiments on two real-world graph benchmarks show that HC-Ref successfully resists various attacks and has better node classification performance compared to several baseline methods. ",

Previously, deep feature re-weighting (DFR) has proposed retraining the last layer of a pre-trained network on balanced data concerning spurious attributes, making it robust to spurious correlation. However, spurious attribute annotations are not always available. In order to provide group robustness without such annotations, we propose a new method, called loss-based feature re-weighting (LFR), in which we infer a grouping of the data by evaluating an ERM-pre-trained model on a small left-out split of the training data. Then, a balanced number of samples is chosen by selecting high-loss samples from misclassified data points and low-loss samples from correctly-classified ones. Finally, we retrain the last layer on the selected balanced groups to make the model robust to spurious correlation. For a complete assessment, we evaluate LFR on various versions of Waterbirds and CelebA datasets with different spurious correlations, which is a novel technique for observing the model's performance in a wide range of spuriosity rates. While LFR is extremely fast and straightforward, it outperforms the previous methods that do not assume group label availability, as well as the DFR with group annotations provided, in cases of high spurious correlation in the training data.

Old-school backdoor attacks use strong trigger features that can easily be learned by victim models. Despite robustness against input variation, the robustness however increases the likelihood of unintentional trigger activations. This leaves traces to existing defenses, which find approximate replacements for the original triggers that can activate the backdoor without being identical to the original trigger via, e.g., reverse engineering and sample overlay. In this paper, we propose and investigate a new characteristic of backdoor attacks, namely, backdoor exclusivity, which measures the ability of backdoor triggers to remain effective in the presence of input variation. Building upon the concept of backdoor exclusivity, we propose Backdoor Exclusivity LifTing (BELT), a novel technique which suppresses the association between the backdoor and fuzzy triggers to enhance backdoor exclusivity for defense evasion. Extensive evaluation on three popular backdoor benchmarks validate, our approach substantially enhances the stealthiness of four old-school backdoor attacks, which, after backdoor exclusivity lifting, is able to evade six state-of-the-art backdoor countermeasures, at almost no cost of the attack success rate and normal utility. For example, one of the earliest backdoor attacks BadNet, enhanced by BELT, evades most of the state-of-the-art defenses including ABS and MOTH which would otherwise recognize the backdoored model.

    "abstract": "Structural pruning has become an integral part of neural network optimization, used to achieve architectural configurations which can be deployed and run more efficiently on embedded devices. Previous results showed that pruning is possible with minimum performance loss by utilizing a reinforcement learning agent which makes decisions about the sparsity level of each neural layer by maximizing as a reward the accuracy of the network. We introduce a novel information-theoretic reward function which minimizes the spatial entropy of convolutional activations. This minimization ultimately acts as a proxy for maintaining accuracy, although these two criteria are not related in any way. Our method shows that there is another possibility to preserve accuracy without the need to directly optimize it in the agent's reward function. In our experiments, we were able to reduce the total number of FLOPS of multiple popular neural network architectures by 5-10x, incurring minimal or no performance drop and being on par with the solution found by maximizing the accuracy.

    "abstract": "Any-to-any singing voice conversion is confronted with a significant challenge of ``timbre leakage'' issue caused by inadequate disentanglement between the content and the speaker timbre. To address this issue, this study introduces a novel neural concatenative singing voice conversion (NeuCoSVC) framework. The NeuCoSVC framework comprises a self-supervised learning (SSL) representation extractor, a neural harmonic signal generator, and a waveform synthesizer. Specifically, the SSL extractor condenses the audio into a sequence of fixed-dimensional SSL features. The harmonic signal generator produces both raw and filtered harmonic signals as the pitch information by leveraging a linear time-varying (LTV) filter. Finally, the audio generator reconstructs the audio waveform based on the SSL features, as well as the harmonic signals and the loudness information. During inference, the system performs voice conversion by substituting source SSL features with their nearest counterparts from a matching pool, which comprises SSL representations extracted from the target audio, while the raw harmonic signals and the loudness are extracted from the source audio and are kept unchanged. Since the utilized SSL features in the conversion stage are directly from the target audio, the proposed framework has great potential to address the ``timbre leakage'' issue caused by previous disentanglement-based approaches. Experimental results confirm that the proposed system delivers much better performance than the speaker embedding approach (disentanglement-based) in the context of one-shot SVC across intra-language, cross-language, and cross-domain evaluations.

Mutual Information (MI) has been widely used as a criterion for identifying unimportant filters to prune. However, existing methods for MI computation suffer from high computational cost and sensitivity to noise, leading to suboptimal pruning performance. We propose a novel method to improve MI computation for CNN pruning, using the spatial aura entropy. The spatial aura entropy is useful for evaluating the heterogeneity in the distribution of the neural activations over a neighborhood, providing information about local features. Our method effectively improves the MI computation for CNN pruning, leading to more robust and efficient pruning.

    "abstract": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve superior performance on various tasks compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but ViTs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is one of the most successful methods to build robust CNN models. Thus, recent works explored new methodologies for adversarial training of ViTs based on the differences between ViTs and CNNs, such as better training strategies, preventing attention from focusing on a single block, or discarding low-attention embeddings. However, these methods still follow the design of traditional supervised adversarial training, limiting the potential of adversarial training on ViTs. This paper proposes a novel defense method, MIMIR, which aims to build a different adversarial training methodology by utilizing Masked Image Modeling at pre-training. We create an autoencoder that accepts adversarial examples as input but takes the clean examples as the modeling target. Then, we create a mutual information (MI) penalty following the idea of the Information Bottleneck. Among the two information source inputs and corresponding adversarial perturbation, the perturbation information is eliminated due to the constraint of the modeling target. Next, we provide a theoretical analysis of MIMIR using the bounds of the MI penalty. We also design two adaptive attacks when the adversary is aware of the MIMIR defense and show that MIMIR still performs well. The experimental results show that MIMIR improves (natural and adversarial) accuracy on average by 4.19\\% on CIFAR-10 and 5.52\\% on ImageNet-1K, compared to baselines. On Tiny-ImageNet, we obtained improved natural accuracy of 2.99\\% on average and comparable adversarial accuracy.

Despite promising progress in recent years, Deepfake detection remains a challenging problem due to the complexity and variability of face forgery techniques. Existing Deepfake detection methods are often devoted to extracting features by designing sophisticated networks but ignore the influence of perceptual quality of faces. Considering the complexity of the quality distribution of both real and fake faces, we propose a novel Deepfake detection framework named DeepFidelity to adaptively distinguish real and fake faces with varying image quality by mining the perceptual forgery fidelity of face images. Specifically, we improve the model's ability to identify complex samples by mapping real and fake face data of different qualities to different scores to distinguish them in a more detailed way. In addition, we propose a network structure called Symmetric Spatial Attention Augmentation based vision Transformer (SSAAFormer), which uses the symmetry of face images to promote the network to model the geographic long-distance relationship at the shallow level and augment local features. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods. ",

One of the standing issues is the small input window of current models which often cannot fully fit the context code required for a bug fix (e.g., method or class declarations of a project). Instead, input is often restricted to the local context, that is, the lines below and above the bug location. In this work we study the importance of this local context on repair success: how much local context is needed?; is context before or after the bug location more important? how is local context tied to the bug type? To answer these questions we train and evaluate Transformer models in many different local context configurations on three datasets and two programming languages. Our results indicate that overall repair success increases with the size of the local context (albeit not for all bug types) and confirm the common practice that roughly 50-60% of the input window should be used for context leading the bug. Our results are not only relevant for researchers working on Transformer-based APR tools but also for benchmark and dataset creators who must decide what and how much context to include in their datasets.

However, they inherently suffer from incompleteness, i.e. entities or facts about entities are missing. Consequently, a larger body of works focuses on the completion of missing information in KGs, which is commonly referred to as link prediction (LP). This task has traditionally and extensively been studied in the transductive setting, where all entities and relations in the testing set are observed during training. Recently, several works have tackled the LP task under more challenging settings, where entities and relations in the test set may be unobserved during training, or appear in only a few facts. These works are known as inductive, few-shot, and zero-shot link prediction. In this work, we conduct a systematic review of existing works in this area. A thorough analysis leads us to point out the undesirable existence of diverging terminologies and task definitions for the aforementioned settings, which further limits the possibility of comparison between recent works. We consequently aim at dissecting each setting thoroughly, attempting to reveal its intrinsic characteristics. A unifying nomenclature is ultimately proposed to refer to each of them in a simple and consistent manner. ",

However, these systems often struggle to transfer simulated experiences to real-world scenarios.

We propose a novel image generation approach, integrating a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to facilitate the creation of realistic urban traffic images. We harness GNNs' ability to process information at different levels of abstraction alongside segmented images for preserving locality data. The presented architecture leverages the power of SPADE and Graph ATtention (GAT) network models to create images based on simulated traffic scenarios. These images are conditioned by factors such as entity positions, colors, and time of day. The uniqueness of our approach lies in its ability to effectively translate structured and human-readable conditions, encoded as graphs, into realistic images. This advancement contributes to applications requiring rich traffic image datasets, from data augmentation to urban traffic solutions. We further provide an application to test the model's capabilities, including generating images with manually defined positions for various entities. ",

However, data heterogeneity in wireless signals and data privacy regulation of distributed sensing have been considered as the major challenges that hinder the wide applications of wireless sensing in large area networking systems. Motivated by the observation that signals recorded by wireless receivers are closely related to a set of physical-layer semantic features, in this paper we propose a novel zero-shot wireless sensing solution that allows models constructed in one or a limited number of locations to be directly transferred to other locations without any labeled data. We develop a novel physical-layer semantic-aware network (pSAN) framework to characterize the correlation between physical-layer semantic features and the sensing data distributions across different receivers. We then propose a pSAN-based zero-shot learning solution in which each receiver can obtain a location-specific gesture recognition model by directly aggregating the already constructed models of other receivers. We theoretically prove that models obtained by our proposed solution can approach the optimal model without requiring any local model training. Experimental results once again verify that the accuracy of models derived by our proposed solution matches that of the models trained by the real labeled data based on supervised learning approach.

    "abstract": "Yahoo's native advertising (also known as Gemini native) serves billions of ad impressions daily, reaching a yearly run-rate of many hundred of millions USD. Driving the Gemini native models that are used to predict both click probability (pCTR) and conversion probability (pCONV) is OFFSET - a feature enhanced collaborative-filtering (CF) based event prediction algorithm. \\offset is a one-pass algorithm that updates its model for every new batch of logged data using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based approach. Since OFFSET represents its users by their features (i.e., user-less model) due to sparsity issues, rule based hard frequency capping (HFC) is used to control the number of times a certain user views a certain ad. Moreover, related statistics reveal that user ad fatigue results in a dramatic drop in click through rate (CTR). Therefore, to improve click prediction accuracy, we propose a soft frequency capping (SFC) approach, where the frequency feature is incorporated into the OFFSET model as a user-ad feature and its weight vector is learned via logistic regression as part of OFFSET training. Online evaluation of the soft frequency capping algorithm via bucket testing showed a significant 7.3% revenue lift. Since then, the frequency feature enhanced model has been pushed to production serving all traffic, and is generating a hefty revenue lift for Yahoo Gemini native. We also report related statistics that reveal, among other things, that while users' gender does not affect ad fatigue, the latter seems to increase with users' age. ",

We use an extensible framework to define 15 probing tasks that exercise surface, syntactic, structural and semantic characteristics of source code. We probe 8 pre-trained source code models, as well as a natural language model (BERT) as our baseline. We find that models that incorporate some structural information (such as GraphCodeBERT) have a better representation of source code characteristics. Surprisingly, we find that for some probing tasks, BERT is competitive with the source code models, indicating that there are ample opportunities to improve source-code specific pre-training on the respective code characteristics. We encourage other researchers to evaluate their models with our probing task suite, so that they may peer into the hidden layers of the models and identify what intrinsic code characteristics are encoded.

In line with these principles, O-RAN presents an avenue to bypass vendor lock-in, circumvent vertical configurations, enable network programmability, and facilitate integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI) support. Moreover, modern container orchestration frameworks (e.g., Kubernetes, Red Hat OpenShift) simplify the way cellular base stations, as well as the newly introduced RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs), are deployed, managed, and orchestrated. While this enables cost reduction via infrastructure sharing, it also makes it more challenging to meet O-RAN control latency requirements, especially during peak resource utilization. To address this problem, we propose ScalO-RAN, a control framework rooted in optimization and designed as an O-RAN rApp that allocates and scales AI-based O-RAN applications (xApps, rApps, dApps) to: (i) abide by application-specific latency requirements, and (ii) monetize the shared infrastructure while reducing energy consumption. We prototype ScalO-RAN on an OpenShift cluster with base stations, RIC, and a set of AI-based xApps deployed as micro-services. We evaluate ScalO-RAN both numerically and experimentally. Our results show that ScalO-RAN can optimally allocate and distribute O-RAN applications within available computing nodes to accommodate even stringent latency requirements. More importantly, we show that scaling O-RAN applications is primarily a time-constrained problem rather than a resource-constrained one, where scaling policies must account for stringent inference time of AI applications, and not only how many resources they consume.

Most of the existing research follows a single-step price- or incentive-based scheme for unlocking the flexibility potential of buildings. In contrast, this paper proposes a novel two-step design approach for better harnessing buildings' energy flexibility. In a first step, a robust optimization model is formulated for assessing the energy flexibility of buildings in the presence of uncertain predictions of external conditions, such as ambient temperature, solar irradiation, etc. In a second step, energy flexibility is activated in response to a feasible demand response (DR) request from grid operators without violating indoor temperature constraints, even in the presence of uncertain external conditions. The proposed approach is tested on a high-fidelity Modelica simulator to evaluate its effectiveness. Simulation results show that, compared with price-based demand-side management, the proposed approach achieves greater energy reduction during peak hours. ",

However, we get robust guarantees only when models are trained to satisfy Differential Privacy (DP). Alas, this is not the standard in industry as many companies use ad-hoc strategies to empirically evaluate privacy based on the statistical similarity between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we review the privacy metrics offered by leading companies in this space and shed light on a few critical flaws in reasoning about privacy entirely via empirical evaluations. We analyze the undesirable properties of the most popular metrics and filters and demonstrate their unreliability and inconsistency through counter-examples. We then present a reconstruction attack, ReconSyn, which successfully recovers (i.e., leaks all attributes of) at least 78% of the low-density train records (or outliers) with only black-box access to a single fitted generative model and the privacy metrics. Finally, we show that applying DP only to the model or using low-utility generators does not mitigate ReconSyn as the privacy leakage predominantly comes from the metrics. Overall, our work serves as a warning to practitioners not to deviate from established privacy-preserving mechanisms. ",

    "abstract": "Overactuated tilt-rotor platforms offer many advantages over traditional fixed-arm drones, allowing the decoupling of the applied force from the attitude of the robot. This expands their application areas to aerial interaction and manipulation, and allows them to overcome disturbances such as from ground or wall effects by exploiting the additional degrees of freedom available to their controllers. However, the overactuation also complicates the control problem, especially if the motors that tilt the arms have slower dynamics than those spinning the propellers. Instead of building a complex model-based controller that takes all of these subtleties into account, we attempt to learn an end-to-end pose controller using reinforcement learning, and show its superior behavior in the presence of inertial and force disturbances compared to a state-of-the-art traditional controller.

    "abstract": "Financial networks raise a significant computational challenge in identifying insolvent firms and evaluating their exposure to systemic risk. This task, known as the clearing problem, is computationally tractable when dealing with simple debt contracts. However under the presence of certain derivatives called credit default swaps (CDSes) the clearing problem is $\\textsf{FIXP}$-complete. Existing techniques only show $\\textsf{PPAD}$-hardness for finding an $\\epsilon$-solution for the clearing problem with CDSes within an unspecified small range for $\\epsilon$. We present significant progress in both facets of the clearing problem: (i) intractability of approximate solutions; (ii) algorithms and heuristics for computable solutions. Leveraging $\\textsf{Pure-Circuit}$ (FOCS'22), we provide the first explicit inapproximability bound for the clearing problem involving CDSes. Our primal contribution is a reduction from $\\textsf{Pure-Circuit}$ which establishes that finding approximate solutions is $\\textsf{PPAD}$-hard within a range of roughly 5%. To alleviate the complexity of the clearing problem, we identify two meaningful restrictions of the class of financial networks motivated by regulations: (i) the presence of a central clearing authority; and (ii) the restriction to covered CDSes. We provide the following results: (i.) The $\\textsf{PPAD}$-hardness of approximation persists when central clearing authorities are introduced; (ii.) An optimisation-based method for solving the clearing problem with central clearing authorities; (iii.) A polynomial-time algorithm when the two restrictions hold simultaneously. ",

However, like other large-scale models, they may leak private information about their training data. Here, we demonstrate a privacy vulnerability of diffusion models through a \\emph{membership inference (MI) attack}, which aims to identify whether a target example belongs to the training set when given the trained diffusion model. Our proposed MI attack learns quantile regression models that predict (a quantile of) the distribution of reconstruction loss on examples not used in training. This allows us to define a granular hypothesis test for determining the membership of a point in the training set, based on thresholding the reconstruction loss of that point using a custom threshold tailored to the example. We also provide a simple bootstrap technique that takes a majority membership prediction over ``a bag of weak attackers'' which improves the accuracy over individual quantile regression models. We show that our attack outperforms the prior state-of-the-art attack while being substantially less computationally expensive -- prior attacks required training multiple ``shadow models'' with the same architecture as the model under attack, whereas our attack requires training only much smaller models.

    "abstract": "Open Domain Generalization (ODG) is a challenging task as it not only deals with distribution shifts but also category shifts between the source and target datasets. To handle this task, the model has to learn a generalizable representation that can be applied to unseen domains while also identify unknown classes that were not present during training. Previous work has used multiple source-specific networks, which involve a high computation cost. Therefore, this paper proposes a method that can handle ODG using only a single network. The proposed method utilizes a head that is pre-trained by linear-probing and employs two regularization terms, each targeting the regularization of feature extractor and the classification head, respectively. The two regularization terms fully utilize the pre-trained features and collaborate to modify the head of the model without excessively altering the feature extractor. This ensures a smoother softmax output and prevents the model from being biased towards the source domains. The proposed method shows improved adaptability to unseen domains and increased capability to detect unseen classes as well. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves competitive performance in several benchmarks. We also justify our method with careful analysis of the effect on the logits, features, and the head. ",

The most prominent motion prediction approaches are based on modeling the distribution of possible future trajectories of each actor in autonomous system's vicinity. These \"independent\" marginal predictions might be accurate enough to properly describe casual driving situations where the prediction target is not likely to interact with other actors. They are, however, inadequate for modeling interactive situations where the actors' future trajectories are likely to intersect. To mitigate this issue we propose Kraken -- a real-time trajectory prediction model capable of approximating pairwise interactions between the actors as well as producing accurate marginal predictions. Kraken relies on a simple Greedy Mode Processing technique allowing it to convert a factorized prediction for a pair of agents into a physically-plausible joint prediction. It also utilizes the Mode Transformer module to increase the diversity of predicted trajectories and make the joint prediction more informative. We evaluate Kraken on Waymo Motion Prediction challenge where it held the first place in the Interaction leaderboard and the second place in the Motion leaderboard in October 2021. ",

Recent methods attach a neural radiance field (NeRF) to an articulated structure, e.g., a body model or a skeleton, to map points into a pose canonical space while conditioning the NeRF on the skeletal pose. These approaches typically parameterize the neural field with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) leading to a slow runtime. To address this drawback, we propose TriHuman a novel human-tailored, deformable, and efficient tri-plane representation, which achieves real-time performance, state-of-the-art pose-controllable geometry synthesis as well as photorealistic rendering quality. At the core, we non-rigidly warp global ray samples into our undeformed tri-plane texture space, which effectively addresses the problem of global points being mapped to the same tri-plane locations. We then show how such a tri-plane feature representation can be conditioned on the skeletal motion to account for dynamic appearance and geometry changes. Our results demonstrate a clear step towards higher quality in terms of geometry and appearance modeling of humans as well as runtime performance. ",

We systematically characterize DARLEI's performance under various conditions, revealing factors impacting diversity of evolved morphologies. For example, by enabling inter-agent collisions within the simulator, we find that we can simulate some multi-agent interactions between the same morphology, and see how it influences individual agent capabilities and long-term evolutionary adaptation. While current results demonstrate limited diversity across generations, we hope to extend DARLEI in future work to include interactions between diverse morphologies in richer environments, and create a platform that allows for coevolving populations and investigating emergent behaviours in them.

    "abstract": "Typically, machine learning models are trained and evaluated without making any distinction between users (e.g, using traditional hold-out and cross-validation). However, this produces inaccurate performance metrics estimates in multi-user settings. That is, situations where the data were collected by multiple users with different characteristics (e.g., age, gender, height, etc.) which is very common in user computer interaction and medical applications. For these types of scenarios model evaluation strategies that provide better performance estimates have been proposed such as mixed, user-independent, user-dependent, and user-adaptive models. Although those strategies are better suited for multi-user systems, they are typically assessed with respect to performance metrics that capture the overall behavior of the models and do not provide any performance guarantees for individual predictions nor they provide any feedback about the predictions' uncertainty. In order to overcome those limitations, in this work we evaluated the conformal prediction framework in several multi-user settings. Conformal prediction is a model agnostic method that provides confidence guarantees on the predictions, thus, increasing the trustworthiness and robustness of the models. We conducted extensive experiments using different evaluation strategies and found significant differences in terms of conformal performance measures. We also proposed several visualizations based on matrices, graphs, and charts that capture different aspects of the resulting prediction sets. ",

In this regard, a morphology-based bone enhancement and detection followed by a Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm and Hough transform is proposed. The proposed algorithm is tested on synthetic and real ultrasound images of laminar bone, and the results are compared with the template matching based Ligamentum Flavum (LF) detection method. Results indicate that the proposed method can faster detect the diagonal shape of the laminar bone and its corresponding epidural depth. Furthermore, the proposed method is reliable enough providing anesthesiologists with real-time information while an epidural needle insertion is performed. It has to be noted that using the ultrasound images is to help anesthesiologists to perform the blind injection, and due to quite a lot of errors occurred in ultrasound-imaging-based methods, these methods can not completely replace the tissue pressure-based method. And in the end, when the needle is injected into the area (dura space) measurements can only be trusted to the extent of tissue resistance. Despite the fairly limited amount of training data available in this study, a significant improvement of the segmentation speed of lumbar bones and epidural depth in ultrasound scans with a rational accuracy compared to the LF-based detection method was found.

However, evaluating the index from preoperative MRI images requires high radiologists' skill and experience. Therefore, the aim of this study is to segment the mesorectum, rectum, and rectal cancer region so that the system can predict T-stage from segmentation results. Generally, shortage of large and diverse dataset and high quality annotation are known to be the bottlenecks in computer aided diagnostics development. Regarding rectal cancer, advanced cancer images are very rare, and per-pixel annotation requires high radiologists' skill and time. Therefore, it is not feasible to collect comprehensive disease patterns in a training dataset. To tackle this, we propose two kinds of approaches of image synthesis-based late stage cancer augmentation and semi-supervised learning which is designed for T-stage prediction. In the image synthesis data augmentation approach, we generated advanced cancer images from labels. The real cancer labels were deformed to resemble advanced cancer labels by artificial cancer progress simulation. Next, we introduce a T-staging loss which enables us to train segmentation models from per-image T-stage labels. The loss works to keep inclusion/invasion relationships between rectum and cancer region consistent to the ground truth T-stage. The verification tests show that the proposed method obtains the best sensitivity (0.76) and specificity (0.80) in distinguishing between over T3 stage and underT2. In the ablation studies, our semi-supervised learning approach with the T-staging loss improved specificity by 0.13. Adding the image synthesis-based data augmentation improved the DICE score of invasion cancer area by 0.08 from baseline. ",

    "abstract": "Many renal cancers are incidentally found on non-contrast CT (NCCT) images. On contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) images, most kidney tumors, especially renal cancers, have different intensity values compared to normal tissues. However, on NCCT images, some tumors called isodensity tumors, have similar intensity values to the surrounding normal tissues, and can only be detected through a change in organ shape. Several deep learning methods which segment kidney tumors from CECT images have been proposed and showed promising results. However, these methods fail to capture such changes in organ shape on NCCT images. In this paper, we present a novel framework, which can explicitly capture protruded regions in kidneys to enable a better segmentation of kidney tumors. We created a synthetic mask dataset that simulates a protuberance, and trained a segmentation network to separate the protruded regions from the normal kidney regions. To achieve the segmentation of whole tumors, our framework consists of three networks. The first network is a conventional semantic segmentation network which extracts a kidney region mask and an initial tumor region mask. The second network, which we name protuberance detection network, identifies the protruded regions from the kidney region mask. Given the initial tumor region mask and the protruded region mask, the last network fuses them and predicts the final kidney tumor mask accurately. The proposed method was evaluated on a publicly available KiTS19 dataset, which contains 108 NCCT images, and showed that our method achieved a higher dice score of 0.615 (+0.097) and sensitivity of 0.721 (+0.103) compared to 3D-UNet. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning method that is specifically designed for kidney tumor segmentation on NCCT images. ",

    "title": "Quantifying white matter hyperintensity and brain volumes in  heterogeneous clinical and low-field portable MRI",
    "abstract": "Brain atrophy and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) are critical neuroimaging features for ascertaining brain injury in cerebrovascular disease and multiple sclerosis. Automated segmentation and quantification is desirable but existing methods require high-resolution MRI with good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This precludes application to clinical and low-field portable MRI (pMRI) scans, thus hampering large-scale tracking of atrophy and WMH progression, especially in underserved areas where pMRI has huge potential. Here we present a method that segments white matter hyperintensity and 36 brain regions from scans of any resolution and contrast (including pMRI) without retraining. We show results on six public datasets and on a private dataset with paired high- and low-field scans (3T and 64mT), where we attain strong correlation between the WMH ($\\rho$=.85) and hippocampal volumes (r=.89) estimated at both fields. Our method is publicly available as part of FreeSurfer, at: this http URL ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a causal low-latency low-complexity approach for binaural multichannel blind speaker separation in noisy reverberant conditions. The model, referred to as Group Communication Binaural Filter and Sum Network (GCBFSnet) predicts complex filters for filter-and-sum beamforming in the time-frequency domain. We apply Group Communication (GC), i.e., latent model variables are split into groups and processed with a shared sequence model with the aim of reducing the complexity of a simple model only containing one convolutional and one recurrent module. With GC we are able to reduce the size of the model by up to 83 % and the complexity up to 73 % compared to the model without GC, while mostly retaining performance. Even for the smallest model configuration, GCBFSnet matches the performance of a low-complexity TasNet baseline in most metrics despite the larger size and higher number of required operations of the baseline.
