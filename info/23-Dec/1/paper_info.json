    "abstract": "This research examines the polycentric governance of digital assets in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). It offers a theoretical framework and addresses a critical challenge facing decentralized governance by developing a method to identify sybils, or spurious identities. The method uses graph deep learning techniques to identify sybil activity in a DAO governance dataset (snapshot.org). Specifically, a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) learned voting behaviours and a fast k-means vector clustering algorithm (FAISS) used the high dimensional embeddings to identify similar nodes in a graph. The results reveal that deep learning can effectively identify sybils, reducing the voting graph by 2-5%. This research underscores the importance of sybil resistance in DAOs and offers a novel perspective on decentralized governance, informing future policy, regulation, and governance practices. ",

    "abstract": "A Python interface is developed for the GPWR Simulator to automatically simulate cyber-spoofing of different steam generator parameters and plant operation. Specifically, steam generator water level, feedwater flowrate, steam flowrate, valve position, and steam generator controller parameters, including controller gain and time constant, can be directly attacked using command inject, denial of service, and man-in-the-middle type attacks. Plant operation can be initialized to any of the initial conditions provided by the GPWR simulator. Several different diagnostics algorithms have been implemented for anomaly detection, including physics-based diagnostics with Kalman filtering, data-driven diagnostics, noise profiling, and online sensor validation. Industry-standard safety analysis code RELAP5 is also available as a part of the toolkit. Diagnostics algorithms are analyzed based on accuracy and efficiency. Our observations indicate that physics-based diagnostics with Kalman filtering are the most robust. An experimental quantum kernel has been added to the framework for preliminary testing. Our first impressions suggest that while quantum kernels can be accurate, just like any other kernels, their applicability is problem/data dependent, and can be prone to overfitting. ",

Although great strides have been made in optimizing model compression techniques such as model architecture search and knowledge distillation, the availability of data and computational resources remains a considerable hurdle for these optimizations. This paper introduces LayerCollapse, a novel alternative adaptive model compression methodology. LayerCollapse works by eliminating non-linearities within the network and collapsing two consecutive fully connected layers into a single linear transformation. This approach simultaneously reduces both the number of layers and the parameter count, thereby enhancing model efficiency. We also introduce a compression aware regularizer, which compresses the model in alignment with the dataset quality and model expressiveness, consequently reducing overfitting across tasks. Our results demonstrate LayerCollapse's effective compression and regularization capabilities in multiple fine-grained classification benchmarks, achieving up to 74% post training compression with minimal accuracy loss. We compare this method with knowledge distillation on the same target network, showcasing a five-fold increase in computational efficiency and 8% improvement in overall accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.

This evolution render the image manipulation more accessible, thereby intensifying the risk of altering the conveyed information within original images and even propagating misinformation. Consequently, there exists a critical demand for robust capable of detecting the edited images. However, the lack of comprehensive dataset containing images edited with abundant and advanced generative regional editing methods poses a substantial obstacle to the advancement of corresponding detection methods. We endeavor to fill the vacancy by constructing the GRE dataset, a large-scale generative regional editing dataset with the following advantages: 1) Collection of real-world original images, focusing on two frequently edited scenarios. 2) Integration of a logical and simulated editing pipeline, leveraging multiple large models in various modalities. 3) Inclusion of various editing approaches with distinct architectures. 4) Provision of comprehensive analysis tasks. We perform comprehensive experiments with proposed three tasks: edited image classification, edited method attribution and edited region localization, providing analysis of distinct editing methods and evaluation of detection methods in related fields. We expect that the GRE dataset can promote further research and exploration in the field of generative region editing detection. ",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, significant advances have been made in the field of image search for e-commerce applications. Traditional image-to-image retrieval models, which focus solely on image details such as texture, tend to overlook useful semantic information contained within the images. As a result, the retrieved products might possess similar image details, but fail to fulfil the user's search goals. Moreover, the use of image-to-image retrieval models for products containing multiple images results in significant online product feature storage overhead and complex mapping implementations. In this paper, we report the design and deployment of the proposed Multi-modal Item Embedding Model (MIEM) to address these limitations. It is capable of utilizing both textual information and multiple images about a product to construct meaningful product features. By leveraging semantic information from images, MIEM effectively supplements the image search process, improving the overall accuracy of retrieval results. MIEM has become an integral part of the Shopee image search platform. Since its deployment in March 2023, it has achieved a remarkable 9.90% increase in terms of clicks per user and a 4.23% boost in terms of orders per user for the image search feature on the Shopee e-commerce platform.

    "abstract": "Scene text image super-resolution (STISR) aims at simultaneously increasing the resolution and readability of low-resolution scene text images, thus boosting the performance of the downstream recognition task. Two factors in scene text images, semantic information and visual structure, affect the recognition performance significantly. To mitigate the effects from these factors, this paper proposes a Prior-Enhanced Attention Network (PEAN). Specifically, a diffusion-based module is developed to enhance the text prior, hence offering better guidance for the SR network to generate SR images with higher semantic accuracy. Meanwhile, the proposed PEAN leverages an attention-based modulation module to understand scene text images by neatly perceiving the local and global dependence of images, despite the shape of the text. A multi-task learning paradigm is employed to optimize the network, enabling the model to generate legible SR images. As a result, PEAN establishes new SOTA results on the TextZoom benchmark. Experiments are also conducted to analyze the importance of the enhanced text prior as a means of improving the performance of the SR network.

    "abstract": "Recent progress in computer vision-oriented neural network designs is mostly driven by capturing high-order neural interactions among inputs and features. And there emerged a variety of approaches to accomplish this, such as Transformers and its variants. However, these interactions generate a large amount of intermediate state and/or strong data dependency, leading to considerable memory consumption and computing cost, and therefore compromising the overall runtime performance. To address this challenge, we rethink the high-order interactive neural network design with a quadratic computing approach. Specifically, we propose QuadraNet -- a comprehensive model design methodology from neuron reconstruction to structural block and eventually to the overall neural network implementation. Leveraging quadratic neurons' intrinsic high-order advantages and dedicated computation optimization schemes, QuadraNet could effectively achieve optimal cognition and computation performance. Incorporating state-of-the-art hardware-aware neural architecture search and system integration techniques, QuadraNet could also be well generalized in different hardware constraint settings and deployment scenarios. The experiment shows thatQuadraNet achieves up to 1.5$\\times$ throughput, 30% less memory footprint, and similar cognition performance, compared with the state-of-the-art high-order approaches. ",

Our approach capitalizes on the observation that recent code language models with infilling capabilities can perform \\emph{self-infilling}: whereas infilling operations aim to fill in the middle based on a predefined prefix and suffix, self-infilling sequentially generates both such surrounding context and the infilled content. We utilize this feature to develop an infilling-augmented decoding process that facilitates non-monotonic generation. This approach allows for postponing the generation of uncertain code snippets until a definitive suffix is established, leading to improved control over the generation sequence. In addition, it facilitates a looping mechanism, which can iteratively update and synchronize each piece of generation in a cyclic manner. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our proposed decoding process is effective in enhancing regularity and quality across several code generation benchmarks. ",

For the data to be useful, it must be of comparable quality and adhere to the same recording standards, which is hardly ever the case in archaeology. Here, we present a new data collection method exploiting recent advances in Artificial Intelligence. Our software uses an object detection neural network combined with further classification networks to speed up, automate, and standardise data collection from legacy resources, such as archaeological drawings and photographs in large unsorted PDF files. The AI-assisted workflow detects common objects found in archaeological catalogues, such as graves, skeletons, ceramics, ornaments, stone tools and maps, and spatially relates and analyses these objects on the page to extract real-life attributes, such as the size and orientation of a grave based on the north arrow and the scale. A graphical interface allows for and assists with manual validation. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach by collecting a range of shapes and numerical attributes from richly-illustrated archaeological catalogues, and benchmark it in a real-world experiment with ten users. Moreover, we record geometric whole-outlines through contour detection, an alternative to landmark-based geometric morphometrics not achievable by hand. ",

We extend this block to represent a greater range of convex one-dimensional functions. We derive a manifold of weights such that the output of these new networks utilizes exponentially many piecewise-linear segments. This manifold guides their training process to overcome drawbacks associated with random initialization and unassisted gradient descent. We train these networks to approximate functions which do not necessarily lie on the manifold, showing a significant reduction of error values over conventional approaches. ",

Electric vehicles with vertical take-off and landing capabilities are being developed by numerous market companies as a result of the push toward environmentally sustainable aviation. The next stage in the eVTOL development process would be to define the concept of operation of these conceptual aircraft and then to integrate them with the existing airspace once they are airborne. In addition to coordinating with conventional air traffic and other Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles, collision avoidance with uncooperative airspace users has to be addressed. Birds and drones of all sizes could be dangerous for these low-flying aircraft. Innovative collision detection and avoidance techniques need to be employed due to the uncooperative nature of these airspace users and different performance characteristics of urban air mobility vehicles compared to classical fixed-wing aircraft. The aim of this study is to validate one such system by means of fast-time solutions. This system uses a decision tree and safety envelopes to prevent collisions with non-cooperative airspace members. The system is designed to work with different aircraft configurations used for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations. Various scenarios are modelled by varying intruder type, location, flight path among others. Changes in flight time and closest point of approach are assessed to evaluate the system with regard to safety and efficiency. ",

Indeed, PDL-SCOPF remedies the limitations of supervised counterparts that rely on training instances with their optimal solutions, which becomes impractical for large-scale SCOPF problems. PDL-SCOPF mimics an Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) for training primal and dual networks that learn the primal solutions and the Lagrangian multipliers, respectively, to the unconstrained optimizations. In addition, PDL-SCOPF incorporates a repair layer to ensure the feasibility of the power balance in the nominal case, and a binary search layer to compute, using the Automatic Primary Response (APR), the generator dispatches in the contingencies. The resulting differentiable program can then be trained end-to-end using the objective function of the SCOPF and the power balance constraints of the contingencies. Experimental results demonstrate that the PDL-SCOPF delivers accurate feasible solutions with minimal optimality gaps. The framework underlying PDL-SCOPF aims at bridging the gap between traditional optimization methods and machine learning, highlighting the potential of self-supervised end-to-end primal-dual learning for large-scale optimization tasks.

However, challenges including game complexity and incomplete information still remain to be addressed before they can be sufficiently practical for real-world use. Game complexity refers to the difficulties of solving a multi-player game, which include solution existence, algorithm convergence, and scalability. To address these difficulties, a potential game based framework was developed in our recent work. However, conditions on cost function design need to be enforced to make the game a potential game. This paper relaxes the conditions and makes the potential game approach applicable to more general scenarios, even including the ones that cannot be molded as a potential game. Incomplete information refers to the ego vehicle's lack of knowledge of other traffic agents' cost functions. Cost function deviations between the ego vehicle estimated/learned other agents' cost functions and their actual ones are often inevitable. This motivates us to study the robustness of a game-theoretic solution. This paper defines the robustness margin of a game solution as the maximum magnitude of cost function deviations that can be accommodated in a game without changing the optimality of the game solution. With this definition, closed-form robustness margins are derived. Numerical studies using highway lane-changing scenarios are reported. ",

Consequently, several studies have proposed self-diagnostic facial image-based BMI prediction methods for healthy weight monitoring. These methods have mostly used convolutional neural network (CNN) based regression baselines, such as VGG19, ResNet50, and Efficient-NetB0, for BMI prediction from facial images. However, the high computational requirement of these heavy-weight CNN models limits their deployment to resource-constrained mobile devices, thus deterring weight monitoring using smartphones. This paper aims to develop a lightweight facial patch-based ensemble (PatchBMI-Net) for BMI prediction to facilitate the deployment and weight monitoring using smartphones. Extensive experiments on BMI-annotated facial image datasets suggest that our proposed PatchBMI-Net model can obtain Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in the range [3.58, 6.51] with a size of about 3.3 million parameters. On cross-comparison with heavyweight models, such as ResNet-50 and Xception, trained for BMI prediction from facial images, our proposed PatchBMI-Net obtains equivalent MAE along with the model size reduction of about 5.4x and the average inference time reduction of about 3x when deployed on Apple-14 smartphone. Thus, demonstrating performance efficiency as well as low latency for on-device deployment and weight monitoring using smartphone applications. ",

    "abstract": "With the immense growth of dataset sizes and computing resources in recent years, so-called foundation models have become popular in NLP and vision tasks. In this work, we propose to explore foundation models for the task of keypoint detection on 3D shapes. A unique characteristic of keypoint detection is that it requires semantic and geometric awareness while demanding high localization accuracy. To address this problem, we propose, first, to back-project features from large pre-trained 2D vision models onto 3D shapes and employ them for this task. We show that we obtain robust 3D features that contain rich semantic information and analyze multiple candidate features stemming from different 2D foundation models. Second, we employ a keypoint candidate optimization module which aims to match the average observed distribution of keypoints on the shape and is guided by the back-projected features. The resulting approach achieves a new state of the art for few-shot keypoint detection on the KeyPointNet dataset, almost doubling the performance of the previous best methods. ",

    "abstract": "Introductory programming courses aim to teach students to write code independently. However, transitioning from studying worked examples to generating their own code is often difficult and frustrating for students, especially those with lower CS self-efficacy in general. Therefore, we investigated the impact of using Parsons problems as a code-writing scaffold for students with varying levels of CS self-efficacy. Parsons problems are programming tasks where students arrange mixed-up code blocks in the correct order. We conducted a between-subjects study with undergraduate students (N=89) on a topic where students have limited code-writing expertise. Students were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. Students in one condition practiced writing code without any scaffolding, while students in the other condition were provided with scaffolding in the form of an equivalent Parsons problem. We found that, for students with low CS self-efficacy levels, those who received scaffolding achieved significantly higher practice performance and in-practice problem-solving efficiency compared to those without any scaffolding. Furthermore, when given Parsons problems as scaffolding during practice, students with lower CS self-efficacy were more likely to solve them. In addition, students with higher pre-practice knowledge on the topic were more likely to effectively use the Parsons scaffolding. This study provides evidence for the benefits of using Parsons problems to scaffold students' write-code activities. It also has implications for optimizing the Parsons scaffolding experience for students, including providing personalized and adaptive Parsons problems based on the student's current problem-solving status.

Meanwhile, the concept of mixed-precision quantization (MPQ), where different layers of a deep learning model are assigned varying bit-width, remains unexplored in the FL settings. We present a novel FL algorithm, FedMPQ, which introduces mixed-precision quantization to resource-heterogeneous FL systems. Specifically, local models, quantized so as to satisfy bit-width constraint, are trained by optimizing an objective function that includes a regularization term which promotes reduction of precision in some of the layers without significant performance degradation. The server collects local model updates, de-quantizes them into full-precision models, and then aggregates them into a global model. To initialize the next round of local training, the server relies on the information learned in the previous training round to customize bit-width assignments of the models delivered to different clients. In extensive benchmarking experiments on several model architectures and different datasets in both iid and non-iid settings, FedMPQ outperformed the baseline FL schemes that utilize fixed-precision quantization while incurring only a minor computational overhead on the participating devices.

    "abstract": "Modern machine learning models are able to outperform humans on a variety of non-trivial tasks. However, as the complexity of the models increases, they consume significant amounts of power and still struggle to generalize effectively to unseen data. Local learning, which focuses on updating subsets of a model's parameters at a time, has emerged as a promising technique to address these issues. Recently, a novel local learning algorithm, called Forward-Forward, has received widespread attention due to its innovative approach to learning. Unfortunately, its application has been limited to smaller datasets due to scalability issues. To this end, we propose The Trifecta, a collection of three simple techniques that synergize exceptionally well and drastically improve the Forward-Forward algorithm on deeper networks. Our experiments demonstrate that our models are on par with similarly structured, backpropagation-based models in both training speed and test accuracy on simple datasets. This is achieved by the ability to learn representations that are informative locally, on a layer-by-layer basis, and retain their informativeness when propagated to deeper layers in the architecture. This leads to around 84\\% accuracy on CIFAR-10, a notable improvement (25\\%) over the original FF algorithm. These results highlight the potential of Forward-Forward as a genuine competitor to backpropagation and as a promising research avenue. ",

Different prompt-based datasets can be used to measure social bias across multiple text domains and demographic axes, meaning that testing LLMs on more datasets can potentially help us characterize their biases more fully, and better ensure equal and equitable treatment of marginalized demographic groups. In this work, our focus is two-fold: (1) Benchmarking: a comparison of 6 different prompt-based bias and toxicity metrics across 12 demographic axes and 5 families of generative LLMs. Out of those 6 metrics, AdvPromptSet and HolisticBiasR are novel datasets proposed in the paper. The comparison of those benchmarks gives us insights about the bias and toxicity of the compared models. Therefore, we explore the frequency of demographic terms in common LLM pre-training corpora and how this may relate to model biases. (2) Mitigation: we conduct a comprehensive study of how well 3 bias/toxicity mitigation techniques perform across our suite of measurements. ROBBIE aims to provide insights for practitioners while deploying a model, emphasizing the need to not only measure potential harms, but also understand how they arise by characterizing the data, mitigate harms once found, and balance any trade-offs.

The main reason is that the trajectory is a kind of complex data, including spatial and temporal information, which is crucial for accurate prediction. Intuitively, the more information the model can capture, the more precise the future trajectory can be predicted. However, previous works based on deep learning methods processed spatial and temporal information separately, leading to inadequate spatial information capture, which means they failed to capture the complete spatial information. Therefore, it is of significance to capture information more fully and effectively on vehicle interactions. In this study, we introduced an integrated 3D graph that incorporates both spatial and temporal edges. Based on this, we proposed the integrated 3D graph, which considers the cross-time interaction information. In specific, we design a Spatial-Temporal Fusion (STF) model including Multi-layer perceptions (MLP) and Graph Attention (GAT) to capture the spatial and temporal information historical trajectories simultaneously on the 3D graph. Our experiment on the ApolloScape Trajectory Datasets shows that the proposed STF outperforms several baseline methods, especially on the long-time-horizon trajectory prediction. ",

However, polynomials in the majority of polynomial filters are predefined and remain fixed across all graphs, failing to accommodate the diverse heterophily degrees across different graphs. To tackle this issue, we first investigate the correlation between polynomial bases of desired graph filters and the degrees of graph heterophily via a thorough theoretical analysis. Afterward, we develop an adaptive heterophily basis by incorporating graph heterophily degrees. Subsequently, we integrate this heterophily basis with the homophily basis, creating a universal polynomial basis UniBasis. In consequence, we devise a general polynomial filter UniFilter. Comprehensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets with varying heterophily degrees significantly support the superiority of UniFilter, demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of UniBasis, as well as its promising capability as a new method for graph analysis.

Its ability to learn without heavy reliance on labeled data is a natural antidote to the data sparsity issue. Previous research has found that CL can not only enhance recommendation accuracy but also inadvertently exhibit remarkable robustness against noise. However, this paper identifies a vulnerability of CL-based recommender systems: Compared with their non-CL counterparts, they are even more susceptible to poisoning attacks that aim to promote target items. Our analysis points to the uniform dispersion of representations led by the CL loss as the very factor that accounts for this vulnerability. We further theoretically and empirically demonstrate that the optimization of CL loss can lead to smooth spectral values of representations. Based on these insights, we attempt to reveal the potential poisoning attacks against CL-based recommender systems. The proposed attack encompasses a dual-objective framework: One that induces a smoother spectral value distribution to amplify the CL loss's inherent dispersion effect, named dispersion promotion; and the other that directly elevates the visibility of target items, named rank promotion. We validate the destructiveness of our attack model through extensive experimentation on four datasets. By shedding light on these vulnerabilities, we aim to facilitate the development of more robust CL-based recommender systems. ",

In this paper, we propose an anisotropic neural representation learning method that utilizes learnable view-dependent features to improve scene representation and reconstruction. We model the volumetric function as spherical harmonic (SH)-guided anisotropic features, parameterized by multilayer perceptrons, facilitating ambiguity elimination while preserving the rendering efficiency. To achieve robust scene reconstruction without anisotropy overfitting, we regularize the energy of the anisotropic features during training. Our method is flexiable and can be plugged into NeRF-based frameworks.

Conventional methods generally address AD by preparing augmented negative samples to enforce self-supervised learning. However, these techniques typically do not consider semantics during augmentation, leading to the generation of unrealistic or invalid negative samples. Consequently, the feature extraction network can be hindered from embedding critical features. In this study, inspired by visual attention learning approaches, we propose CutSwap, which leverages saliency guidance to incorporate semantic cues for augmentation. Specifically, we first employ LayerCAM to extract multilevel image features as saliency maps and then perform clustering to obtain multiple centroids. To fully exploit saliency guidance, on each map, we select a pixel pair from the cluster with the highest centroid saliency to form a patch pair. Such a patch pair includes highly similar context information with dense semantic correlations. The resulting negative sample is created by swapping the locations of the patch pair. Compared to prior augmentation methods, CutSwap generates more subtle yet realistic negative samples to facilitate quality feature learning. Extensive experimental and ablative evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art AD performance on two mainstream AD benchmark datasets. ",

    "abstract": "The race to develop image generation models is intensifying, with a rapid increase in the number of text-to-image models available. This is coupled with growing public awareness of these technologies. Though other generative AI models--notably, large language models--have received recent critical attention for the social and other non-technical issues they raise, there has been relatively little comparable examination of image generation models. This paper reports on a novel, comprehensive categorization of the social issues associated with image generation models. At the intersection of machine learning and the social sciences, we report the results of a survey of the literature, identifying seven issue clusters arising from image generation models: data issues, intellectual property, bias, privacy, and the impacts on the informational, cultural, and natural environments. We situate these social issues in the model life cycle, to aid in considering where potential issues arise, and mitigation may be needed. We then compare these issue clusters with what has been reported for large language models. Ultimately, we argue that the risks posed by image generation models are comparable in severity to the risks posed by large language models, and that the social impact of image generation models must be urgently considered.

    "abstract": "The foundation models (FMs) have been used to generate synthetic public datasets for the heterogeneous federated learning (HFL) problem where each client uses a unique model architecture. However, the vulnerabilities of integrating FMs, especially against backdoor attacks, are not well-explored in the HFL contexts. In this paper, we introduce a novel backdoor attack mechanism for HFL that circumvents the need for client compromise or ongoing participation in the FL process. This method plants and transfers the backdoor through a generated synthetic public dataset, which could help evade existing backdoor defenses in FL by presenting normal client behaviors. Empirical experiments across different HFL configurations and benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack compared to traditional client-based attacks. Our findings reveal significant security risks in developing robust FM-assisted HFL systems. This research contributes to enhancing the safety and integrity of FL systems, highlighting the need for advanced security measures in the era of FMs. ",

    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to extract semantic knowledge from limited object instances of novel categories within a target domain. Recent advances in FSOD focus on fine-tuning the base model based on a few objects via meta-learning or data augmentation. Despite their success, the majority of them are grounded with parametric readjustment to generalize on novel objects, which face considerable challenges in Industry 5.0, such as (i) a certain amount of fine-tuning time is required, and (ii) the parameters of the constructed model being unavailable due to the privilege protection, making the fine-tuning fail. Such constraints naturally limit its application in scenarios with real-time configuration requirements or within black-box settings. To tackle the challenges mentioned above, we formalize a novel FSOD task, referred to as Test TIme Few Shot DEtection (TIDE), where the model is un-tuned in the configuration procedure. To that end, we introduce an asymmetric architecture for learning a support-instance-guided dynamic category classifier. Further, a cross-attention module and a multi-scale resizer are provided to enhance the model performance. Experimental results on multiple few-shot object detection platforms reveal that the proposed TIDE significantly outperforms existing contemporary methods.

    "abstract": "Event cameras have emerged as a promising vision sensor in recent years due to their unparalleled temporal resolution and dynamic range. While registration of 2D RGB images to 3D point clouds is a long-standing problem in computer vision, no prior work studies 2D-3D registration for event cameras. To this end, we propose E2PNet, the first learning-based method for event-to-point cloud registration. The core of E2PNet is a novel feature representation network called Event-Points-to-Tensor (EP2T), which encodes event data into a 2D grid-shaped feature tensor. This grid-shaped feature enables matured RGB-based frameworks to be easily used for event-to-point cloud registration, without changing hyper-parameters and the training procedure. EP2T treats the event input as spatio-temporal point clouds. Unlike standard 3D learning architectures that treat all dimensions of point clouds equally, the novel sampling and information aggregation modules in EP2T are designed to handle the inhomogeneity of the spatial and temporal dimensions. Experiments on the MVSEC and VECtor datasets demonstrate the superiority of E2PNet over hand-crafted and other learning-based methods. Compared to RGB-based registration, E2PNet is more robust to extreme illumination or fast motion due to the use of event data. Beyond 2D-3D registration, we also show the potential of EP2T for other vision tasks such as flow estimation, event-to-image reconstruction and object recognition.

This paper focuses on the pivotal effect of the inverse temperature hyperparameter $\\beta$ on the distribution of energy minima of the MHN. To achieve this, the distribution of energy minima is tracked in a simplified MHN in which equidistant normalised patterns are stored. This network demonstrates a phase transition at a critical temperature $\\beta_{\\text{c}}$, from a single global attractor towards highly pattern specific minima as $\\beta$ is increased. Importantly, the dynamics are not solely governed by the hyperparameter $\\beta$ but are instead determined by an effective inverse temperature $\\beta_{\\text{eff}}$ which also depends on the distribution and size of the stored patterns. Recognizing the role of hyperparameters in the MHN could, in the future, aid researchers in the domain of Transformers to optimise their initial choices, potentially reducing the necessity for time and energy expensive hyperparameter fine-tuning.

Existing work typically focuses on settings without unobserved confounding, even though unobserved confounding can lead to severe violations of causal fairness and, thus, unfair predictions. In this work, we analyze the sensitivity of causal fairness to unobserved confounding. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we derive bounds for causal fairness metrics under different sources of unobserved confounding. This enables practitioners to examine the sensitivity of their machine learning models to unobserved confounding in fairness-critical applications. Second, we propose a novel neural framework for learning fair predictions, which allows us to offer worst-case guarantees of the extent to which causal fairness can be violated due to unobserved confounding. Third, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in a series of experiments, including a real-world case study about predicting prison sentences. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work to study causal fairness under unobserved confounding. To this end, our work is of direct practical value as a refutation strategy to ensure the fairness of predictions in high-stakes applications. ",

Our vision is for robots to autonomously learn navigation skills and adapt their behaviors to environmental changes without any human intervention. In this work, we discuss the self-supervised navigation problem and present Dynamic Graph Memory (DGMem), which facilitates training only with on-board observations. With the help of DGMem, agents can actively explore their surroundings, autonomously acquiring a comprehensive navigation policy in a data-efficient manner without external feedback.

Some benchmark data exists, and performance evaluations commonly rely on comparing the scores of observed network events (positives) with those of randomly generated ones (negatives). These evaluation measures depend on both the predictive ability of the model and, crucially, the type of negative samples used. Besides, as generally the case with temporal data, prediction quality may vary over time. This creates a complex evaluation space. In this work, we catalog the possibilities for negative sampling and introduce novel visualization methods that can yield insight into prediction performance and the dynamics of temporal networks. We leverage these visualization tools to investigate the effect of negative sampling on the predictive performance, at the node and edge level. We validate empirically, on datasets extracted from recent benchmarks that the error is typically not evenly distributed across different data segments. Finally, we argue that such visualization tools can serve as powerful guides to evaluate dynamic link prediction methods at different levels. ",

This loss measures the divergence in the predictions between the source model and another, independently trained model, referred to as the witness model. To understand the effect of model alignment, we conduct a geometric anlaysis of the resulting changes in the loss landscape. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset, using a variety of model architectures, demonstrate that perturbations generated from aligned source models exhibit significantly higher transferability than those from the original source model.

The attack requires no knowledge of FL training data and achieves both effectiveness and undetectability. By listening to the benign local models and the global model, the attacker extracts the graph structural correlations among the benign local models and the training data features substantiating the models. The attacker then adversarially regenerates the graph structural correlations while maximizing the FL training loss, and subsequently generates malicious local models using the adversarial graph structure and the training data features of the benign ones. A new algorithm is designed to iteratively train the malicious local models using GAE and sub-gradient descent. The convergence of FL under attack is rigorously proved, with a considerably large optimality gap. Experiments show that the FL accuracy drops gradually under the proposed attack and existing defense mechanisms fail to detect it. The attack can give rise to an infection across all benign devices, making it a serious threat to FL. ",

For any object detector, the obtained box proposals or queries need to be classified and regressed towards ground truth boxes. The common solution for the final predictions is to directly maximize the overlap between each proposal and the ground truth box, followed by a winner-takes-all ranking or non-maximum suppression. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective alternative. For proposal regression, we solve a simpler problem where we regress to the area of intersection between proposal and ground truth. In this way, each proposal only specifies which part contains the object, avoiding a blind inpainting problem where proposals need to be regressed beyond their visual scope. In turn, we replace the winner-takes-all strategy and obtain the final prediction by taking the union over the regressed intersections of a proposal group surrounding an object. Our revisited approach comes with minimal changes to the detection pipeline and can be plugged into any existing method. We show that our approach directly improves canonical object detection and instance segmentation architectures, highlighting the utility of intersection-based regression and grouping. ",

A fundamental workload in this setting is dynamic link prediction: using a history of graph updates to predict whether a given pair of vertices will become connected. Recent schemes for link prediction in such dynamic settings employ Transformers, modeling individual graph updates as single tokens. In this work, we propose HOT: a model that enhances this line of works by harnessing higher-order (HO) graph structures; specifically, k-hop neighbors and more general subgraphs containing a given pair of vertices. Harnessing such HO structures by encoding them into the attention matrix of the underlying Transformer results in higher accuracy of link prediction outcomes, but at the expense of increased memory pressure. To alleviate this, we resort to a recent class of schemes that impose hierarchy on the attention matrix, significantly reducing memory footprint. The final design offers a sweetspot between high accuracy and low memory utilization. HOT outperforms other dynamic GRL schemes, for example achieving 9%, 7%, and 15% higher accuracy than - respectively - DyGFormer, TGN, and GraphMixer, for the MOOC dataset. Our design can be seamlessly extended towards other dynamic GRL workloads. ",

Furthermore, they represent lanes only by sequences of vectors representing center lines and ignore context information like lane dividers and other road elements. We present a novel approach for vector-based trajectory prediction that addresses these shortcomings by leveraging three crucial sources of information: First, we model interactions between traffic agents by a semantic scene graph, that accounts for the nature and important features of their relation. Second, we extract agent-centric image-based map features to model the local map context.

We can view current approaches as aiming to determine where gender assignment falls on a spectrum, from being fully arbitrarily determined to being largely semantically determined. For the latter case, there is a formulation of the neo-Whorfian hypothesis, which claims that even inanimate noun gender influences how people conceive of and talk about objects (using the choice of adjective used to modify inanimate nouns as a proxy for meaning). We offer a novel, causal graphical model that jointly represents the interactions between a noun's grammatical gender, its meaning, and adjective choice. In accordance with past results, we find a relationship between the gender of nouns and the adjectives which modify them. However, when we control for the meaning of the noun, we find that grammatical gender has a near-zero effect on adjective choice, thereby calling the neo-Whorfian hypothesis into question. ",

    "abstract": "Distribution shifts between training and deployment data often affect the performance of machine learning models. In this paper, we explore a setting where a hidden variable induces a shift in the distribution of classes. These distribution shifts are particularly challenging for zero-shot classifiers, as they rely on representations learned from training classes, but are deployed on new, unseen ones. We introduce an algorithm to learn data representations that are robust to such class distribution shifts in zero-shot verification tasks. We show that our approach, which combines hierarchical data sampling with out-of-distribution generalization techniques, improves generalization to diverse class distributions in both simulations and real-world datasets.

    "title": "Fingerprint Matching with Localized Deep Representation",
    "abstract": "Compared to minutia-based fingerprint representations, fixed-length representations are attractive due to simple and efficient matching. However, fixed-length fingerprint representations are limited in accuracy when matching fingerprints with different visible areas, which can occur due to different finger poses or acquisition methods. To address this issue, we propose a localized deep representation of fingerprint, named LDRF. By focusing on the discriminative characteristics within local regions, LDRF provides a more robust and accurate fixed-length representation for fingerprints with variable visible areas. LDRF can be adapted to retain information within any valid area, making it highly flexible. The matching scores produced by LDRF also exhibit intuitive statistical characteristics, which led us to propose a matching score normalization technique to mitigate the uncertainty in the cases of very small overlapping area. With this new technique, we can maintain a high level of accuracy and reliability in our fingerprint matching, even as the size of the database grows rapidly. Our experimental results on 21 datasets containing over 140K fingerprints of various finger poses and impression types show that LDRF outperforms other fixed-length representations and is robust to sensing technologies and impression types. Besides, the proposed matching score normalization effectively reduces the false match rate (FMR) in large-scale identification experiments comprising over 5.11 million fingerprints. Specifically, this technique results in a reduction of two orders of magnitude compared to matching without matching score normalization and five orders of magnitude compared to prior works. ",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is the state-of-the-art approach for learning from decentralized data in privacy-constrained scenarios. As the current literature reports, the main problems associated with FL refer to system and statistical challenges: the former ones demand for efficient learning from edge devices, including lowering communication bandwidth and frequency, while the latter require algorithms robust to non-iidness. State-of-art approaches either guarantee convergence at increased communication cost or are not sufficiently robust to handle extreme heterogeneous local distributions. In this work we propose a novel generalization of the heavy-ball momentum, and present FedHBM to effectively address statistical heterogeneity in FL without introducing any communication overhead. We conduct extensive experimentation on common FL vision and NLP datasets, showing that our FedHBM algorithm empirically yields better model quality and higher convergence speed w.r.t. the state-of-art, especially in pathological non-iid scenarios. While being designed for cross-silo settings, we show how FedHBM is applicable in moderate-to-high cross-device scenarios, and how good model initializations (e.g. pre-training) can be exploited for prompt acceleration. Extended experimentation on large-scale real-world federated datasets further corroborates the effectiveness of our approach for real-world FL applications. ",

However, the continuous evolution of these models often demands further training, which can be resource-intensive. This study introduces a novel approach where we continue the training of these pre-existing 32-bit models using 16-bit precision. This technique not only caters to the need for efficiency in computational resources but also significantly improves the speed of additional training phases. By adopting 16-bit precision for ongoing training, we are able to substantially decrease memory requirements and computational burden, thereby accelerating the training process in a resource-limited setting. Our experiments show that this method maintains the high standards of accuracy set by the original 32-bit training while providing a much-needed boost in training speed. This approach is especially pertinent in today's context, where most models are initially trained in 32-bit and require periodic updates and refinements. The findings from our research suggest that this strategy of 16-bit continuation training can be a key solution for sustainable and efficient deep learning, offering a practical way to enhance pre-trained models rapidly and in a resource-conscious manner.

By integrating NFV and SDN technologies, it is feasible to dynamically reroute traffic to new network function (NF) instances in the event of an NF failure or overload scenario. The fact that the majority of network functions are stateful makes the task more challenging. State migration and state replication are common approaches in achieving elasticity and fault tolerance. The majority of the studies in the literature either emphasize fault tolerance or elastic scalability while designing a state management system for network functions. In this paper, we have designed a complete state management system, called DEFT, that meets both elasticity and fault-tolerance goals. Our system also supports strong consistency on global state updates. While existing designs rely on a central controller or remote central storage to achieve strong consistency on state updates, DEFT utilizes distributed consensus mechanism to achieve the same. We have done a proof of concept implementation of DEFT and extensively tested DEFT under several model conditions to evaluate its scalability and performance. Our experimental results show that DEFT is scalable and maintains a considerably high throughput throughout. It incurs minimal performance overhead while achieving strong consistency on state updates. ",

To address this difficulty, we propose the framework of Generalisable Agents for Neural Network Optimisation (GANNO) -- a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that learns to improve neural network optimisation by dynamically and responsively scheduling hyperparameters during training. GANNO utilises an agent per layer that observes localised network dynamics and accordingly takes actions to adjust these dynamics at a layerwise level to collectively improve global performance. In this paper, we use GANNO to control the layerwise learning rate and show that the framework can yield useful and responsive schedules that are competitive with handcrafted heuristics. Furthermore, GANNO is shown to perform robustly across a wide variety of unseen initial conditions, and can successfully generalise to harder problems than it was trained on. Our work presents an overview of the opportunities that this paradigm offers for training neural networks, along with key challenges that remain to be overcome. ",

    "abstract": "Class Incremental Learning (CIL) is inspired by the human ability to learn new classes without forgetting previous ones. CIL becomes more challenging in real-world scenarios when the samples in each incremental step are imbalanced. This creates another branch of problem, called Generalized Class Incremental Learning (GCIL) where each incremental step is structured more realistically. Grow When Required (GWR) network, a type of Self-Organizing Map (SOM), dynamically create and remove nodes and edges for adaptive learning. GWR performs incremental learning from feature vectors extracted by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which acts as a feature extractor. The inherent ability of GWR to form distinct clusters, each corresponding to a class in the feature vector space, regardless of the order of samples or class imbalances, is well suited to achieving GCIL. To enhance GWR's classification performance, a high-quality feature extractor is required. However, when the convolutional layers are adapted at each incremental step, the GWR nodes corresponding to prior knowledge are subject to near-invalidation. This work introduces the Self Augmenting Task Hallucinal Unified Representation (SATHUR), which re-initializes the GWR network at each incremental step, aligning it with the current feature extractor. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art GCIL methods on CIFAR-100 and CORe50 datasets. ",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present CrimeGAT, a novel application of Graph Attention Networks (GATs) for predictive policing in criminal networks. Criminal networks pose unique challenges for predictive analytics due to their complex structure, multi-relational links, and dynamic behavior. Traditional methods often fail to capture these complexities, leading to suboptimal predictions. To address these challenges, we propose the use of GATs, which can effectively leverage both node features and graph structure to make predictions. Our proposed CrimeGAT model integrates attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of a node's neighbors, thereby capturing the local and global structures of criminal networks. We formulate the problem as learning a function that maps node features and graph structure to a prediction of future criminal activity. The experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that CrimeGAT out-performs conventional methods in predicting criminal activities, thereby providing a powerful tool for law enforcement agencies to proactively deploy resources. Furthermore, the interpretable nature of the attentionmechanism inGATs offers insights into the key players and relationships in criminal networks. This research opens new avenues for applying deep learning techniques in the Aeld of predictive policing and criminal network analysis. ",

From this deliberately simple robot-terrain model, we derive a hop-to-hop energy return map, and we use physical experiments and simulations to validate the hop-to-hop energy map for a real robot hopping on a real deformable substrate. The dynamical properties (fixed points, eigenvalues, basins of attraction) of this map provide insights into efficient, responsive, and robust locomotion on deformable terrain. Specifically, we identify constant-fixed-point surfaces in a controller parameter space that suggest it is possible to tune control parameters for efficiency or responsiveness while targeting a desired gait energy level. We also identify conditions under which fixed points of the energy map are globally stable, and we further characterize the basins of attraction of fixed points when these conditions are not satisfied. We conclude by discussing the implications of this hop-to-hop energy map for planning, control, and estimation for efficient, agile, and robust legged locomotion on deformable terrain. ",

In this work, we study group-wise sparse, non-linear, multi-layered and learnable mixing schemes of inputs and find that they are complementary to many standard neural architectures. Following our observations and drawing inspiration from the Fast Fourier Transform, we generalize Butterfly Structure to use non-linear mixer function allowing for MLP as mixing function called Butterfly MLP. We were also able to mix along sequence dimension for Transformer-based architectures called Butterfly Attention. Experiments on CIFAR and LRA datasets demonstrate that the proposed Non-Linear Butterfly Mixers are efficient and scale well when the host architectures are used as mixing function.

We prove that the model checking problem for first-order logic is fixed-parameter tractable on every monadically stable graph class. This extends the results of [Grohe, Kreutzer, and Siebertz; J. ACM '17] for nowhere dense classes and of [Dreier, M\\\"ahlmann, and Siebertz; STOC '23] for structurally nowhere dense classes to all monadically stable classes. As a complementary hardness result, we prove that for every hereditary graph class $\\mathscr{C}$ that is edge-stable (excludes some half-graph as a semi-induced subgraph) but not monadically stable, first-order model checking is $\\mathrm{AW}[*]$-hard on $\\mathscr{C}$, and $\\mathrm{W}[1]$-hard when restricted to existential sentences. This confirms, in the special case of edge-stable classes, an on-going conjecture that the notion of monadic NIP delimits the tractability of first-order model checking on hereditary classes of graphs. For our tractability result, we first prove that monadically stable graph classes have almost linear neighborhood complexity. Using this, we construct sparse neighborhood covers for monadically stable classes, which provides the missing ingredient for the algorithm of [Dreier, M\\\"ahlmann, and Siebertz; STOC '23]. The key component of this construction is the usage of orders with low crossing number [Welzl; SoCG '88], a tool from the area of range queries. For our hardness result, we prove a new characterization of monadically stable graph classes in terms of forbidden induced subgraphs. We then use this characterization to show that in hereditary classes that are edge-stable but not monadically stable, one can effectively interpret the class of all graphs using only existential formulas.

Thanks to the domain adaptation capability of the proposed model, the domain shift between the source and target domain is minimized.

While some work has found that the surprisal estimates from these models can be used to predict a wide range of human neural and behavioral responses, other work studying more complex syntactic phenomena has found that these surprisal estimates generate incorrect behavioral predictions. This paper explores the extent to which the misalignment between empirical and model-predicted behavior can be minimized by training models on more developmentally plausible data, such as in the BabyLM Challenge. We trained teacher language models on the BabyLM \"strict-small\" dataset and used sentence level surprisal estimates from these teacher models to create a curriculum. We found tentative evidence that our curriculum made it easier for models to acquire linguistic knowledge from the training data: on the subset of tasks in the BabyLM challenge suite evaluating models' grammatical knowledge of English, models first trained on the BabyLM data curriculum and then on a few randomly ordered training epochs performed slightly better than models trained on randomly ordered epochs alone. This improved linguistic knowledge acquisition did not result in better alignment with human reading behavior, however: models trained on the BabyLM dataset (with or without a curriculum) generated predictions that were as misaligned with human behavior as models trained on larger less curated datasets. This suggests that training on developmentally plausible datasets alone is likely insufficient to generate language models capable of accurately predicting human language processing. ",

In image-text retrieval, our method consistently obtains 5.6 ~ 35.0% and 16.8 ~ 46.1% improvement on R@1 under the fine-tuning and zero-shot settings, respectively. Notably, our zero-shot results are comparable to fine-tuning on target datasets, which encourages more exploration on the versatile use of MLLMs. ",

    "abstract": "The problem of online change point detection is to detect abrupt changes in properties of time series, ideally as soon as possible after those changes occur. Existing work on online change point detection either assumes i.i.d data, focuses on asymptotic analysis, does not present theoretical guarantees on the trade-off between detection accuracy and detection delay, or is only suitable for detecting single change points. In this work, we study the online change point detection problem for linear dynamical systems with unknown dynamics, where the data exhibits temporal correlations and the system could have multiple change points. We develop a data-dependent threshold that can be used in our test that allows one to achieve a pre-specified upper bound on the probability of making a false alarm. We further provide a finite-sample-based bound for the probability of detecting a change point. Our bound demonstrates how parameters used in our algorithm affect the detection probability and delay, and provides guidance on the minimum required time between changes to guarantee detection. ",

We design adaptive coarse spaces that complement a near-kernel space made from the gradient of scalar functions.

While gossip communication -- where agents can exchange information with their connected neighbors -- is more cost-effective than communicating with the remote server, it often requires a greater number of communication rounds, especially for large and sparse networks. To tackle the trade-off, we examine the communication efficiency under a semi-decentralized communication protocol, in which agents can perform both agent-to-agent and agent-to-server communication in a probabilistic manner. We design a tailored communication-efficient algorithm over semi-decentralized networks, referred to as PISCO, which inherits the robustness to data heterogeneity thanks to gradient tracking and allows multiple local updates for saving communication. We establish the convergence rate of PISCO for nonconvex problems and show that PISCO enjoys a linear speedup in terms of the number of agents and local updates. Our numerical results highlight the superior communication efficiency of PISCO and its resilience to data heterogeneity and various network topologies. ",

The presented automaton learns to recognize arbitrary symbols (e.g., letters of an alphabet) when they are presented repeatedly, as they are when children learn to read. On a second hierarchical level, the model creates abstract categories representing the learnt symbols. The fundamental computational unit are simple McCulloch-Pitts neurons arranged into fully-connected groups (Hopfield networks with randomly initialized weights), which are \"selected\", in an evolutionary sense, through symbol presentation. The learning process is fully tractable and easily interpretable for humans, in contrast to most neural network architectures. Computational properties of Hopfield networks enabling pattern recognition are discussed. In simulations, the model achieves high accuracy in learning the letters of the Latin alphabet, presented as binary patterns on a grid. This paper is a proof of concept with no claims to state-of-the-art performance in letter recognition, but hopefully inspires new thinking in bio-inspired machine learning. ",

Its discriminators play a dual role: one enforces that the perturbations follow a Gaussian distribution, making them indistinguishable from Gaussian noise, while the other ensures these perturbations account for realistic channel effects and resemble no-channel perturbations. Our proposed CDI-aware GAN can be used as an attacker and a defender. In attack scenarios, the CDI-aware GAN demonstrates its prowess by generating robust adversarial perturbations that effectively deceive the target classifier, outperforming known methods.

While this paper focuses on network traffic prediction using our adaptive forecasting framework, this framework can also be applied to other machine learning applications in uncertain environments. The framework begins with unsupervised clustering of time-series data to identify unique trends and seasonal patterns. Subsequently, we apply supervised learning for traffic volume prediction within each cluster. This specialization towards specific traffic behaviors occurs without penalties from spatial and temporal variations. Finally, the framework adaptively assigns trained models to new, previously unseen cells.

This proposed methodology serves to optimize the semiparametric efficiency bound in causal inference by orchestrating CNFs to align with Wasserstein gradient flows. Our approach not only endeavors to minimize the mean squared error in the estimation but also imbues the estimators with geometric sophistication, thereby enhancing robustness against misspecification. This robustness is crucial, as it alleviates the dependence on the standard $n^{\\frac{1}{4}}$ rate for a doubly-robust perturbation direction in TMLE. By incorporating robust optimization principles and differential geometry into the estimators, the developed geometry-aware CNFs represent a significant advancement in the pursuit of doubly robust causal inference.

In this work, we show that the late-time training dynamics of quantum neural networks can be described by the generalized Lotka-Volterra equations, which lead to a dynamical phase transition. When the targeted value of cost function crosses the minimum achievable value from above to below, the dynamics evolve from a frozen-kernel phase to a frozen-error phase, showing a duality between the quantum neural tangent kernel and the total error. In both phases, the convergence towards the fixed point is exponential, while at the critical point becomes polynomial. Via mapping the Hessian of the training dynamics to a Hamiltonian in the imaginary time, we reveal the nature of the phase transition to be second-order with the exponent $\\nu=1$, where scale invariance and closing gap are observed at critical point. We also provide a non-perturbative analytical theory to explain the phase transition via a restricted Haar ensemble at late time, when the output state approaches the steady state.

To address this, we need a method to obtain misalignment states, aiding in the reconstruction of accurate point spread functions for data processing methods or facilitating adjustments of optical components for improved image quality. Since sky survey telescopes consist of many optical elements, they result in a vast array of potential misalignment states, some of which are intricately coupled, posing detection challenges. However, by continuously adjusting the misalignment states of optical elements, we can disentangle coupled states. Based on this principle, we propose a deep neural network to extract misalignment states from continuously varying point spread functions in different field of views. To ensure sufficient and diverse training data, we recommend employing a digital twin to obtain data for neural network training. Additionally, we introduce the state graph to store misalignment data and explore complex relationships between misalignment states and corresponding point spread functions, guiding the generation of training data from experiments. Once trained, the neural network estimates misalignment states from observation data, regardless of the impacts caused by atmospheric turbulence, noise, and limited spatial sampling rates in the detector.

Currently, a major area of research involves the converting non-graph input data for GNN-based models, notably in scenarios where the data originates from images. One approach involves converting images into nodes by identifying significant keypoints within them. Super-Retina, a semi-supervised technique, has been utilized for detecting keypoints in retinal images. However, its limitations lie in the dependency on a small initial set of ground truth keypoints, which is progressively expanded to detect more keypoints. Having encountered difficulties in detecting consistent initial keypoints in brain images using SIFT and LoFTR, we proposed a new approach: radiomic feature-based keypoint detection. Demonstrating the anatomical significance of the detected keypoints was achieved by showcasing their efficacy in improving registration processes guided by these keypoints. Subsequently, these keypoints were employed as the ground truth for the keypoint detection method (LK-SuperRetina). Furthermore, the study showcases the application of GNNs in image matching, highlighting their superior performance in terms of both the number of good matches and confidence scores. This research sets the stage for expanding GNN applications into various other applications, including but not limited to image classification, segmentation, and registration. ",

PAUNet is a variant of U-Net and Res-Net, designed to effectively capture the large-scale contextual information of multi-band satellite images in visible, water vapor, and infrared bands through encoder convolutional layers with center cropping and attention mechanisms. We built upon the Focal Precipitation Loss including an exponential component (e-FPL), which further enhanced the importance across different precipitation categories, particularly medium and heavy rain. Trained on a substantial dataset from various European regions, PAUNet demonstrates notable accuracy with a higher Critical Success Index (CSI) score than the baseline model in predicting rainfall over multiple time slots. PAUNet's architecture and training methodology showcase improvements in precipitation forecasting, crucial for sectors like emergency services and retail and supply chain management. ",

The implementation of molecular computational systems holds significant interest and potential in the fields of synthetic biology and molecular computation. This two-part article aims to introduce a programmable biochemical reaction network (BCRN) system endowed with mass action kinetics that realizes the fully connected neural network (FCNN) and has the potential to act automatically in vivo. In part I, the feedforward propagation computation, the backpropagation component, and all bridging processes of FCNN are ingeniously designed as specific BCRN modules based on their dynamics. This approach addresses a design gap in the biochemical assignment module and judgment termination module and provides a novel precise and robust realization of bi-molecular reactions for the learning process. Through equilibrium approaching, we demonstrate that the designed BCRN system achieves FCNN functionality with exponential convergence to target computational results, thereby enhancing the theoretical support for such work. Finally, the performance of this construction is further evaluated on two typical logic classification problems. ",

We attribute the cause of such distortions to the poor calibration of the discriminator, which hampers its ability to provide meaningful feedback to the generator for learning high-quality images. To address this problem, we propose a simple but non-travel diffusion-style data augmentation scheme for current GAN-based SR methods, known as DifAugGAN. It involves adapting the diffusion process in generative diffusion models for improving the calibration of the discriminator during training motivated by the successes of data augmentation schemes in the field to achieve good calibration. Our DifAugGAN can be a Plug-and-Play strategy for current GAN-based SISR methods to improve the calibration of the discriminator and thus improve SR performance. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the superiority of DifAugGAN over state-of-the-art GAN-based SISR methods across both synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing notable advancements in both qualitative and quantitative results.

    "abstract": "Molecular docking is a key computational tool utilized to predict the binding conformations of small molecules to protein targets, which is fundamental in the design of novel drugs. Despite recent advancements in geometric deep learning-based approaches leading to improvements in blind docking efficiency, these methods have encountered notable challenges, such as limited generalization performance on unseen proteins, the inability to concurrently address the settings of blind docking and site-specific docking, and the frequent occurrence of physical implausibilities such as inter-molecular steric clash. In this study, we introduce DeltaDock, a robust and versatile framework designed for efficient molecular docking to overcome these challenges. DeltaDock operates in a two-step process: rapid initial complex structures sampling followed by multi-scale iterative refinement of the initial structures. In the initial stage, to sample accurate structures with high efficiency, we develop a ligand-dependent binding site prediction model founded on large protein models and graph neural networks. This model is then paired with GPU-accelerated sampling algorithms. The sampled structures are updated using a multi-scale iterative refinement module that captures both protein-ligand atom-atom interactions and residue-atom interactions in the following stage. Distinct from previous geometric deep learning methods that are conditioned on the blind docking setting, DeltaDock demonstrates superior performance in both blind docking and site-specific docking settings. Comprehensive experimental results reveal that DeltaDock consistently surpasses baseline methods in terms of docking accuracy. Furthermore, it displays remarkable generalization capabilities and proficiency for predicting physically valid structures, thereby attesting to its robustness and reliability in various scenarios.

This paper first introduces three common logical circuit decision criteria in hard decisions and analyzes their decision rigor. Building upon hard decisions, the paper further introduces a method for multi-user spectrum sensing based on soft decisions. Then the paper simulates the false alarm probability and detection probability curves corresponding to the three criteria. The simulated results of multi-user collaborative sensing indicate that the simulation process significantly reduces false alarm probability and enhances detection probability. This approach effectively detects spectrum resources unoccupied during idle periods, leveraging the concept of time-division multiplexing and rationalizing the redistribution of information resources. The entire computation process relies on the calculation principles of power spectral density in communication theory, involving threshold decision detection for noise power and the sum of noise and signal power. It provides a secondary decision detection, reflecting the perceptual decision performance of logical detection methods with relative accuracy. ",

Causal machine learning may assist scientists in the discovery of relevant and interpretable patterns of causation in simulations. We introduce Targeted Causal Reduction (TCR), a method for turning complex models into a concise set of causal factors that explain a specific target phenomenon. We derive an information theoretic objective to learn TCR from interventional data or simulations and propose algorithms to optimize this objective efficiently. TCR's ability to generate interpretable high-level explanations from complex models is demonstrated on toy and mechanical systems, illustrating its potential to assist scientists in the study of complex phenomena in a broad range of disciplines.

    "abstract": "Machine learning algorithms are heavily relied on to understand the vast amounts of data from high-energy particle collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The data from such collision events can naturally be represented with graph structures. Therefore, deep geometric methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), have been leveraged for various data analysis tasks in high-energy physics. One typical task is jet tagging, where jets are viewed as point clouds with distinct features and edge connections between their constituent particles. The increasing size and complexity of the LHC particle datasets, as well as the computational models used for their analysis, greatly motivate the development of alternative fast and efficient computational paradigms such as quantum computation. In addition, to enhance the validity and robustness of deep networks, one can leverage the fundamental symmetries present in the data through the use of invariant inputs and equivariant layers. In this paper, we perform a fair and comprehensive comparison between classical graph neural networks (GNNs) and equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) and their quantum counterparts: quantum graph neural networks (QGNNs) and equivariant quantum graph neural networks (EQGNN). The four architectures were benchmarked on a binary classification task to classify the parton-level particle initiating the jet. Based on their AUC scores, the quantum networks were shown to outperform the classical networks. However, seeing the computational advantage of the quantum networks in practice may have to wait for the further development of quantum technology and its associated APIs. ",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the issue of balancing graph summarization and graph change detection. Graph summarization compresses large-scale graphs into a smaller scale. However, the question remains: To what extent should the original graph be compressed? This problem is solved from the perspective of graph change detection, aiming to detect statistically significant changes using a stream of summary graphs. If the compression rate is extremely high, important changes can be ignored, whereas if the compression rate is extremely low, false alarms may increase with more memory. This implies that there is a trade-off between compression rate in graph summarization and accuracy in change detection. We propose a novel quantitative methodology to balance this trade-off to simultaneously realize reliable graph summarization and change detection. We introduce a probabilistic structure of hierarchical latent variable model into a graph, thereby designing a parameterized summary graph on the basis of the minimum description length principle. The parameter specifying the summary graph is then optimized so that the accuracy of change detection is guaranteed to suppress Type I error probability (probability of raising false alarms) to be less than a given confidence level. First, we provide a theoretical framework for connecting graph summarization with change detection. Then, we empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on synthetic and real datasets. ",

Instead of training and deploying a single deep model, we proceed by choosing among multiple tiny NNs trained in a self-supervised manner. The main challenge then becomes to determine and switch to the best NN among the available ones, as an incorrect NN will fail to localize the client. In order to upkeep the localization accuracy, we propose two switching schemes: one based on a Kalman filter, and one based on the statistical distribution of the training data. We analyze the proposed schemes via simulations, showing that our approach outperforms both geometric localization schemes and the use of a single NN. ",
