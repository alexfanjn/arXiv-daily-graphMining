    "abstract": "Taiwanese Hokkien is declining in use and status due to a language shift towards Mandarin in Taiwan. This is partly why it is a low resource language in NLP and speech research today. To ensure that the state of the art in speech processing does not leave Taiwanese Hokkien behind, we contribute a 1.5-hour dataset of Taiwanese Hokkien to ML-SUPERB's hidden set. Evaluating ML-SUPERB's suite of self-supervised learning (SSL) speech representations on our dataset, we find that model size does not consistently determine performance. In fact, certain smaller models outperform larger ones. Furthermore, linguistic alignment between pretraining data and the target language plays a crucial role. ",

    "abstract": "Link prediction in biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) aims at predicting unknown interactions between entities, including drug-target interaction (DTI) and drug-drug interaction (DDI), which is critical for drug discovery and therapeutics. Previous methods prefer to utilize the rich semantic relations and topological structure of the KG to predict missing links, yielding promising outcomes. However, all these works only focus on improving the predictive performance without considering the inevitable noise and unreliable interactions existing in the KGs, which limits the development of KG-based computational methods. To address these limitations, we propose a Denoised Link Prediction framework, called DenoisedLP. DenoisedLP obtains reliable interactions based on the local subgraph by denoising noisy links in a learnable way, providing a universal module for mining underlying task-relevant relations. To collaborate with the smoothed semantic information, DenoisedLP introduces the semantic subgraph by blurring conflict relations around the predicted link. By maximizing the mutual information between the reliable structure and smoothed semantic relations, DenoisedLP emphasizes the informative interactions for predicting relation-specific links. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that DenoisedLP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on DTI and DDI prediction tasks, and verify the effectiveness and robustness of denoising unreliable interactions on the contaminated KGs.

    "abstract": "Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a vital task in industry advertising systems. Most existing methods focus on the structure design of neural network for better accuracy and suffer from the data sparsity problem. Especially in industry advertising systems, the widely applied negative sample downsampling technique due to resource limitation worsens the problem, resulting in a decline in performance. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{A}uxiliary Match \\textbf{T}asks for enhancing \\textbf{C}lick-\\textbf{T}hrough \\textbf{R}ate performance (AT4CTR) to alleviate the data sparsity problem. Specifically, we design two match tasks inspired by collaborative filtering to enhance the relevance between user and item. As the \"click\" action is a strong signal which indicates user's preference towards item directly, we make the first match task aim at pulling closer the representation between user and item regarding the positive samples. Since the user's past click behaviors can also be treated as the user him/herself, we apply the next item prediction as the second match task. For both the match tasks, we choose the InfoNCE in contrastive learning as their loss function. The two match tasks can provide meaningful training signals to speed up the model's convergence and alleviate the data sparsity. We conduct extensive experiments on a public dataset and a large-scale industry advertising dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed auxiliary match tasks. AT4CTR has been deployed in the real industry advertising system and gains remarkable revenue. ",

    "abstract": "Numerous machine learning (ML) models have been developed for breast cancer using various types of data. Successful external validation (EV) of ML models is important evidence of their generalizability. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the performance of externally validated ML models based on histopathology images for diagnosis, classification, prognosis, or treatment outcome prediction in female breast cancer. A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, IEEE, MICCAI, and SPIE conferences was performed for studies published between January 2010 and February 2022. The Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) was employed, and the results were narratively described. Of the 2011 non-duplicated citations, 8 journal articles and 2 conference proceedings met inclusion criteria. Three studies externally validated ML models for diagnosis, 4 for classification, 2 for prognosis, and 1 for both classification and prognosis. Most studies used Convolutional Neural Networks and one used logistic regression algorithms. For diagnostic/classification models, the most common performance metrics reported in the EV were accuracy and area under the curve, which were greater than 87% and 90%, respectively, using pathologists' annotations as ground truth. The hazard ratios in the EV of prognostic ML models were between 1.7 (95% CI, 1.2-2.6) and 1.8 (95% CI, 1.3-2.7) to predict distant disease-free survival; 1.91 (95% CI, 1.11-3.29) for recurrence, and between 0.09 (95% CI, 0.01-0.70) and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.43-0.98) for overall survival, using clinical data as ground truth. Despite EV being an important step before the clinical application of a ML model, it hasn't been performed routinely.

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an attacking mechanism to challenge the resilience of autonomous driving systems. Specifically, we manipulate the decision-making processes of an autonomous vehicle by dynamically displaying adversarial patches on a screen mounted on another moving vehicle. These patches are optimized to deceive the object detection models into misclassifying targeted objects, e.g., traffic signs. Such manipulation has significant implications for critical multi-vehicle interactions such as intersection crossing and lane changing, which are vital for safe and efficient autonomous driving systems. Particularly, we make four major contributions. First, we introduce a novel adversarial attack approach where the patch is not co-located with its target, enabling more versatile and stealthy attacks. Moreover, our method utilizes dynamic patches displayed on a screen, allowing for adaptive changes and movement, enhancing the flexibility and performance of the attack. To do so, we design a Screen Image Transformation Network (SIT-Net), which simulates environmental effects on the displayed images, narrowing the gap between simulated and real-world scenarios. Further, we integrate a positional loss term into the adversarial training process to increase the success rate of the dynamic attack. Finally, we shift the focus from merely attacking perceptual systems to influencing the decision-making algorithms of self-driving systems. Our experiments demonstrate the first successful implementation of such dynamic adversarial attacks in real-world autonomous driving scenarios, paving the way for advancements in the field of robust and secure autonomous driving.

    "abstract": "Recently, a few open-vocabulary methods have been proposed by employing a unified architecture to tackle generic segmentation and detection tasks. However, their performance still lags behind the task-specific models due to the conflict between different tasks, and their open-vocabulary capability is limited due to the inadequate use of CLIP. To address these challenges, we present a universal transformer-based framework, abbreviated as OpenSD, which utilizes the same architecture and network parameters to handle open-vocabulary segmentation and detection tasks. First, we introduce a decoder decoupled learning strategy to alleviate the semantic conflict between thing and staff categories so that each individual task can be learned more effectively under the same framework. Second, to better leverage CLIP for end-to-end segmentation and detection, we propose dual classifiers to handle the in-vocabulary domain and out-of-vocabulary domain, respectively. The text encoder is further trained to be region-aware for both thing and stuff categories through decoupled prompt learning, enabling them to filter out duplicated and low-quality predictions, which is important to end-to-end segmentation and detection. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple datasets under various circumstances. The results demonstrate that OpenSD outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation and detection methods in both closed- and open-vocabulary settings.

    "abstract": "We present an approach for analyzing grouping information contained within a neural network's activations, permitting extraction of spatial layout and semantic segmentation from the behavior of large pre-trained vision models. Unlike prior work, our method conducts a wholistic analysis of a network's activation state, leveraging features from all layers and obviating the need to guess which part of the model contains relevant information. Motivated by classic spectral clustering, we formulate this analysis in terms of an optimization objective involving a set of affinity matrices, each formed by comparing features within a different layer. Solving this optimization problem using gradient descent allows our technique to scale from single images to dataset-level analysis, including, in the latter, both intra- and inter-image relationships. Analyzing a pre-trained generative transformer provides insight into the computational strategy learned by such models. Equating affinity with key-query similarity across attention layers yields eigenvectors encoding scene spatial layout, whereas defining affinity by value vector similarity yields eigenvectors encoding object identity. This result suggests that key and query vectors coordinate attentional information flow according to spatial proximity (a `where' pathway), while value vectors refine a semantic category representation (a `what' pathway).

Recently, Hidden Personalized PageRank (HPP) is applied to this problem and found to be more effective compared with prior similarity measures. However, existing solutions for HPP computation incur significant computational costs, rendering it inefficient especially on large graphs. In this paper, we first identify an inherent drawback of HPP and overcome it by proposing bidirectional HPP (BHPP). Then, we formulate similarity search over bipartite graphs as the problem of approximate BHPP computation, and present an efficient solution Approx-BHPP. Specifically, Approx-BHPP offers rigorous theoretical accuracy guarantees with optimal computational complexity by combining deterministic graph traversal with matrix operations in an optimized and non-trivial way. Moreover, our solution achieves significant gain in practical efficiency due to several carefully-designed optimizations. Extensive experiments, comparing BHPP against 8 existing similarity measures over 7 real bipartite graphs, demonstrate the effectiveness of BHPP on query rewriting and item recommendation. Moreover, Approx-BHPP outperforms baseline solutions often by up to orders of magnitude in terms of computational time on both small and large datasets. ",

Prior long-video methods for this task typically contain two stages: proposal selection and grounding regression. However, the proposal selection of these methods is disjoint from the grounding network and is not trained end-to-end, which limits the effectiveness of these methods. Moreover, these methods operate uniformly over the entire temporal window, which is suboptimal given redundant and irrelevant features in long videos. In contrast to these prior approaches, we introduce RGNet, a unified network designed for jointly selecting proposals from hour-long videos and locating moments specified by natural language queries within them. To achieve this, we redefine proposal selection as a video-text retrieval task, i.e., retrieving the correct candidate videos given a text query. The core component of RGNet is a unified cross-modal RG-Encoder that bridges the two stages with shared features and mutual optimization. The encoder strategically focuses on relevant time frames using a sparse sampling technique. RGNet outperforms previous methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on long video temporal grounding datasets MAD and Ego4D. The code is released at https://github.com/Tanveer81/RGNet ",

    "abstract": "Storage disaggregation, wherein storage is accessed over the network, is popular because it allows applications to independently scale storage capacity and bandwidth based on dynamic application demand. However, the added network processing introduced by disaggregation can consume significant CPU resources. In many storage systems, logical storage operations (e.g., lookups, aggregations) involve a series of simple but dependent I/O access patterns. Therefore, one way to reduce the network processing overhead is to execute dependent series of I/O accesses at the remote storage server, reducing the back-and-forth communication between the storage layer and the application. We refer to this approach as \\emph{remote-storage pushdown}. We present BPF-oF, a new remote-storage pushdown protocol built on top of NVMe-oF, which enables applications to safely push custom eBPF storage functions to a remote storage server. The main challenge in integrating BPF-oF with storage systems is preserving the benefits of their client-based in-memory caches. We address this challenge by designing novel caching techniques for storage pushdown, including splitting queries into separate in-memory and remote-storage phases and periodically refreshing the client cache with sampled accesses from the remote storage device. We demonstrate the utility of BPF-oF by integrating it with three storage systems, including RocksDB, a popular persistent key-value store that has no existing storage pushdown capability. We show BPF-oF provides significant speedups in all three systems when accessed over the network, for example improving RocksDB's throughput by up to 2.8$\\times$ and tail latency by up to 2.6$\\times$.

    "abstract": "This paper describes a trapezoidal quadrature method for the discretization of weakly singular, singular and hypersingular boundary integral operators with complex symmetric quadratic forms. Such integral operators naturally arise when complex coordinate methods or complexified contour methods are used for the solution of time-harmonic acoustic and electromagnetic interface problems in three dimensions. The quadrature is an extension of a locally corrected punctured trapezoidal rule in parameter space wherein the correction weights are determined by fitting moments of error in the punctured trapezoidal rule, which is known analytically in terms of the Epstein zeta function. In this work, we analyze the analytic continuation of the Epstein zeta function and the generalized Wigner limits to complex quadratic forms; this analysis is essential to apply the fitting procedure for computing the correction weights. We illustrate the high-order convergence of this approach through several numerical examples. ",

    "abstract": "Microsoft Windows Feedback Hub is designed to receive customer feedback on a wide variety of subjects including critical topics such as power and battery. Feedback is one of the most effective ways to have a grasp of users' experience with Windows and its ecosystem. However, the sheer volume of feedback received by Feedback Hub makes it immensely challenging to diagnose the actual cause of reported issues. To better understand and triage issues, we leverage Double Machine Learning (DML) to associate users' feedback with telemetry signals. One of the main challenges we face in the DML pipeline is the necessity of domain knowledge for model design (e.g., causal graph), which sometimes is either not available or hard to obtain. In this work, we take advantage of reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a prior model that which to some extent compensates for the lack of domain knowledge and could be used as a heuristic for measuring feedback informativeness. Our LLM-based approach is able to extract previously known issues, uncover new bugs, and identify sequences of events that lead to a bug, while minimizing out-of-domain outputs. ",

In this work, we investigate the use of latent spatiotemporal graphs to represent a surgical video in terms of the constituent anatomical structures and tools and their evolving properties over time. To build the graphs, we first predict frame-wise graphs using a pre-trained model, then add temporal edges between nodes based on spatial coherence and visual and semantic similarity. Unlike previous approaches, we incorporate long-term temporal edges in our graphs to better model the evolution of the surgical scene and increase robustness to temporary occlusions. We also introduce a novel graph-editing module that incorporates prior knowledge and temporal coherence to correct errors in the graph, enabling improved downstream task performance. Using our graph representations, we evaluate two downstream tasks, critical view of safety prediction and surgical phase recognition, obtaining strong results that demonstrate the quality and flexibility of the learned representations.

    "abstract": "Despite the widespread testing protocols for COVID-19, there are still significant challenges in early detection of the disease, which is crucial for preventing its spread and optimizing patient outcomes. Owing to the limited testing capacity in resource-strapped settings and the limitations of the available traditional methods of testing, it has been established that a fast and efficient strategy is important to fully stop the virus. Machine learning models can analyze large datasets, incorporating patient-reported symptoms, clinical data, and medical imaging. Symptom-based detection methods have been developed to predict COVID-19, and they have shown promising results. In this paper, we provide an overview of the landscape of symptoms-only machine learning models for predicting COVID-19, including their performance and limitations. The review will also examine the performance of symptom-based models when compared to image-based models. Because different studies used varying datasets, methodologies, and performance metrics. Selecting the model that performs best relies on the context and objectives of the research. However, based on the results, we observed that ensemble classifier performed exceptionally well in predicting the occurrence of COVID-19 based on patient symptoms with the highest overall accuracy of 97.88%. Gradient Boosting Algorithm achieved an AUC (Area Under the Curve) of 0.90 and identified key features contributing to the decision-making process. Image-based models, as observed in the analyzed studies, have consistently demonstrated higher accuracy than symptom-based models, often reaching impressive levels ranging from 96.09% to as high as 99%.

In contrast to the current state-of-the-practice method for small body shape reconstruction, i.e., SPC, which relies on human-in-the-loop verification and high-fidelity a priori information to achieve accurate results, we forego the expensive maplet estimation step and instead leverage dense keypoint measurements and correspondences from an autonomous keypoint detection and matching method based on deep learning to provide the necessary photogrammetric constraints. Moreover, we develop a factor graph-based approach allowing for simultaneous optimization of the spacecraft's pose, landmark positions, Sun-relative direction, and surface normals and albedos via fusion of Sun sensor measurements and image keypoint measurements. The proposed framework is validated on real imagery of the Cornelia crater on Asteroid 4 Vesta, along with pose estimation and mapping comparison against an SPC reconstruction, where we demonstrate precise alignment to the SPC solution without relying on any a priori camera pose and topography information or humans-in-the-loop ",

Leveraging insight into the fixed point of the score matching objective as the score map is regularized by its Dirichlet energy, we show that it is possible to retrieve the topological dimension of the manifold learned by the score map. We then introduce a novel method to measure the learned manifold's topological dimension (i.e., local intrinsic dimension) using adversarial attacks, thereby generating useful interpretations of the learned manifold.

Recognized as an NP-hard prob-lem, graph partitioning lacks polynomial-time algorithms for its resolution. Recently, there has been a burgeoning interest in leveraging machine learn-ing, particularly approaches like supervised, unsupervised, and reinforce-ment learning, to tackle such NP-hard problems. However, these methods face significant hurdles: supervised learning is constrained by the necessity of labeled solution instances, which are often computationally impractical to obtain; reinforcement learning grapples with instability in the learning pro-cess; and unsupervised learning contends with the absence of a differentia-ble loss function, a consequence of the discrete nature of most combinatorial optimization problems. Addressing these challenges, our research introduces a novel pipeline employing an unsupervised graph neural network to solve the graph partitioning problem. The core innovation of this study is the for-mulation of a differentiable loss function tailored for this purpose.

These layers appear in common subcomponents, such as in the ff module of Transformers. DYAD is based on a bespoke near-sparse matrix structure which approximates the dense \"weight\" matrix W that matrix-multiplies the input in the typical realization of such a layer, a.k.a DENSE. Our alternative near-sparse matrix structure is decomposable to a sum of 2 matrices permutable to a block-sparse counterpart. These can be represented as 3D tensors, which in unison allow a faster execution of matrix multiplication with the mini-batched input matrix X compared to DENSE (O(rows(W ) x cols(W )) --> O( rows(W ) x cols(W ) # of blocks )). As the crux of our experiments, we pretrain both DYAD and DENSE variants of 2 sizes of the OPT arch and 1 size of the Pythia arch, including at different token scales of the babyLM benchmark. We find DYAD to be competitive (>= 90%) of DENSE performance on zero-shot (e.g. BLIMP), few-shot (OPENLM) and finetuning (GLUE) benchmarks, while being >=7-15% faster to train on-GPU even at 125m scale, besides surfacing larger speedups at increasing scale and model width.

We comprehensively analyze the learning dynamics by investigating a layer's reconstruction ability of the input and prediction performance based on the evolution of parameters during training. We empirically show the existence of three phases using common datasets and architectures such as ResNet and VGG: (i) near constant reconstruction loss, (ii) decrease, and (iii) increase. We also derive an empirically grounded data model and prove the existence of phases for single-layer networks. Technically, our approach leverages classical complexity analysis. It differs from IB by relying on measuring reconstruction loss rather than information theoretic measures to relate information of intermediate layers and inputs. Our work implies a new best practice for transfer learning: We show empirically that the pre-training of a classifier should stop well before its performance is optimal. ",

    "abstract": "Bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are now demonstrating comparable accuracy to intricate convolutional neural networks (CNN), all while delivering remarkable energy and latency efficiency when deployed on neuromorphic hardware. In particular, ANN-to-SNN conversion has recently gained significant traction in developing deep SNNs with close to state-of-the-art (SOTA) test accuracy on complex image recognition tasks. However, advanced ANN-to-SNN conversion approaches demonstrate that for lossless conversion, the number of SNN time steps must equal the number of quantization steps in the ANN activation function. Reducing the number of time steps significantly increases the conversion error. Moreover, the spiking activity of the SNN, which dominates the compute energy in neuromorphic chips, does not reduce proportionally with the number of time steps. To mitigate the accuracy concern, we propose a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion framework, that incurs an exponentially lower number of time steps compared to that required in the SOTA conversion approaches. Our framework modifies the SNN integrate-and-fire (IF) neuron model with identical complexity and shifts the bias term of each batch normalization (BN) layer in the trained ANN. To mitigate the spiking activity concern, we propose training the source ANN with a fine-grained L1 regularizer with surrogate gradients that encourages high spike sparsity in the converted SNN. Our proposed framework thus yields lossless SNNs with ultra-low latency, ultra-low compute energy, thanks to the ultra-low timesteps and high spike sparsity, and ultra-high test accuracy, for example, 73.30% with only 4 time steps on the ImageNet dataset.

The evolution is computed using a combination of characteristic and finite volume methods. For the linear spatial flux, the method is not subject to any time step size, and it is shown theoretically that the error at any time step is bounded by the representation errors of the initial and boundary condition. For the quadratic flux, an error estimate is studied in a companion paper.

This discrepancy highlights a previously unidentified vulnerability: attacks exploiting tasks with weaker safety alignment, like summarization, can potentially compromise the integraty of tasks traditionally deemed more robust, such as translation and question-answering (QA). Moreover, the concurrent use of multiple NLP tasks with lesser safety alignment increases the risk of LLMs inadvertently processing harmful content.

Nevertheless, recent studies show that an adversary can still be possible to infer private information about devices' data, e.g., sensitive attributes such as income, race, and sexual orientation. To mitigate the attribute inference attacks, various existing privacy-preserving FL methods can be adopted/adapted. However, all these existing methods have key limitations: they need to know the FL task in advance, or have intolerable computational overheads or utility losses, or do not have provable privacy guarantees. We address these issues and design a task-agnostic privacy-preserving presentation learning method for FL ({\\bf TAPPFL}) against attribute inference attacks. TAPPFL is formulated via information theory. Specifically, TAPPFL has two mutual information goals, where one goal learns task-agnostic data representations that contain the least information about the private attribute in each device's data, and the other goal ensures the learnt data representations include as much information as possible about the device data to maintain FL utility. We also derive privacy guarantees of TAPPFL against worst-case attribute inference attacks, as well as the inherent tradeoff between utility preservation and privacy protection.

    "abstract": "Wildfires pose a serious threat to the environment of the world. The global wildfire season length has increased by 19% and severe wildfires have besieged nations around the world. Every year, forests are burned by wildfires, causing vast amounts of carbon dioxide to be released into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. There is a need for a system which prevents, detects, and suppresses wildfires. The AI based Wildfire Prevention, Detection and Suppression System (WPDSS) is a novel, fully automated, end to end, AI based solution to effectively predict hotspots and detect wildfires, deploy drones to spray fire retardant, preventing and suppressing wildfires. WPDSS consists of four steps. 1. Preprocessing: WPDSS loads real time satellite data from NASA and meteorological data from NOAA of vegetation, temperature, precipitation, wind, soil moisture, and land cover for prevention. For detection, it loads the real time data of Land Cover, Humidity, Temperature, Vegetation, Burned Area Index, Ozone, and CO2. It uses the process of masking to eliminate not hotspots and not wildfires such as water bodies, and rainfall. 2. Learning: The AI model consists of a random forest classifier, which is trained using a labeled dataset of hotspots and wildfires and not hotspots and not wildfires. 3. Identification of hotspots and wildfires: WPDSS runs the real time data through the model to automatically identify hotspots and wildfires. 4. Drone deployment: The drone flies to the identified hotspot or wildfire location. WPDSS attained a 98.6% accuracy in identifying hotspots and a 98.7% accuracy in detecting wildfires. WPDSS will reduce the impacts of climate change, protect ecosystems and biodiversity, avert huge economic losses, and save human lives. The power of WPDSS developed can be applied to any location globally to prevent and suppress wildfires, reducing climate change. ",

    "abstract": "With the advancement in robotics, it is becoming increasingly common for large factories and warehouses to incorporate visual SLAM (vSLAM) enabled automated robots that operate closely next to humans. This makes any adversarial attacks on vSLAM components potentially detrimental to humans working alongside them. Loop Closure Detection (LCD) is a crucial component in vSLAM that minimizes the accumulation of drift in mapping, since even a small drift can accumulate into a significant drift over time. A prior work by Kim et al., SymbioLCD2, unified visual features and semantic objects into a single graph structure for finding loop closure candidates. While this provided a performance improvement over visual feature-based LCD, it also created a single point of vulnerability for potential graph-based adversarial attacks. Unlike previously reported visual-patch based attacks, small graph perturbations are far more challenging to detect, making them a more significant threat. In this paper, we present Adversarial-LCD, a novel black-box evasion attack framework that employs an eigencentrality-based perturbation method and an SVM-RBF surrogate model with a Weisfeiler-Lehman feature extractor for attacking graph-based LCD. Our evaluation shows that the attack performance of Adversarial-LCD with the SVM-RBF surrogate model was superior to that of other machine learning surrogate algorithms, including SVM-linear, SVM-polynomial, and Bayesian classifier, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack framework. Furthermore, we show that our eigencentrality-based perturbation method outperforms other algorithms, such as Random-walk and Shortest-path, highlighting the efficiency of Adversarial-LCD's perturbation selection method.

    "abstract": "Integration of machine learning (ML) into the topology optimization (TO) framework is attracting increasing attention, but data acquisition in data-driven models is prohibitive. Compared with popular ML methods, the physics-informed neural network (PINN) can avoid generating enormous amounts of data when solving forward problems and additionally provide better inference. To this end, a dynamically configured PINN-based topology optimization (DCPINN-TO) method is proposed. The DCPINN is composed of two subnetworks, namely the backbone neural network (NN) and the coefficient NN, where the coefficient NN has fewer trainable parameters. The designed architecture aims to dynamically configure trainable parameters; that is, an inexpensive NN is used to replace an expensive one at certain optimization cycles. Furthermore, an active sampling strategy is proposed to selectively sample collocations depending on the pseudo-densities at each optimization cycle. In this manner, the number of collocations will decrease with the optimization process but will hardly affect it. The Gaussian integral is used to calculate the strain energy of elements, which yields a byproduct of decoupling the mapping of the material at the collocations. Several examples with different resolutions validate the feasibility of the DCPINN-TO method, and multiload and multiconstraint problems are employed to illustrate its generalization. In addition, compared to finite element analysis-based TO (FEA-TO), the accuracy of the displacement prediction and optimization results indicate that the DCPINN-TO method is effective and efficient.

    "abstract": "Underwater image enhancement (UIE) is a challenging task due to the complex degradation caused by underwater environments. To solve this issue, previous methods often idealize the degradation process, and neglect the impact of medium noise and object motion on the distribution of image features, limiting the generalization and adaptability of the model. Previous methods use the reference gradient that is constructed from original images and synthetic ground-truth images. This may cause the network performance to be influenced by some low-quality training data. Our approach utilizes predicted images to dynamically update pseudo-labels, adding a dynamic gradient to optimize the network's gradient space. This process improves image quality and avoids local optima. Moreover, we propose a Feature Restoration and Reconstruction module (FRR) based on a Channel Combination Inference (CCI) strategy and a Frequency Domain Smoothing module (FRS). These modules decouple other degradation features while reducing the impact of various types of noise on network performance. Experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art approaches, especially in achieving performance milestones: PSNR of 25.6dB and SSIM of 0.93 on the UIEB dataset. Its efficiency in terms of parameter size and inference time further attests to its broad practicality. The code will be made publicly available. ",

Specifically, the pseudo-label method tends to amplify the inherent strengths of the detector while accentuating its weaknesses, which is manifested in the missed detection of pseudo-labels, particularly for small and tail category objects. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes Mixed Pseudo Labels (MixPL), consisting of Mixup and Mosaic for pseudo-labeled data, to mitigate the negative impact of missed detections and balance the model's learning across different object scales. Additionally, the model's detection performance on tail categories is improved by resampling labeled data with relevant instances. Notably, MixPL consistently improves the performance of various detectors and obtains new state-of-the-art results with Faster R-CNN, FCOS, and DINO on COCO-Standard and COCO-Full benchmarks. Furthermore, MixPL also exhibits good scalability on large models, improving DINO Swin-L by 2.5% mAP and achieving nontrivial new records (60.2% mAP) on the COCO val2017 benchmark without extra annotations.

    "abstract": "Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) is unsupervised graph representation learning that can obtain useful representation of unknown nodes. The node representation can be utilized as features of downstream tasks. However, GCL is vulnerable to poisoning attacks as with existing learning models. A state-of-the-art defense cannot sufficiently negate adverse effects by poisoned graphs although such a defense introduces adversarial training in the GCL. To achieve further improvement, pruning adversarial edges is important. To the best of our knowledge, the feasibility remains unexplored in the GCL domain. In this paper, we propose a simple defense for GCL, EdgePruner. We focus on the fact that the state-of-the-art poisoning attack on GCL tends to mainly add adversarial edges to create poisoned graphs, which means that pruning edges is important to sanitize the graphs. Thus, EdgePruner prunes edges that contribute to minimizing the contrastive loss based on the node representation obtained after training on poisoned graphs by GCL. Furthermore, we focus on the fact that nodes with distinct features are connected by adversarial edges in poisoned graphs. Thus, we introduce feature similarity between neighboring nodes to help more appropriately determine adversarial edges. This similarity is helpful in further eliminating adverse effects from poisoned graphs on various datasets. Finally, EdgePruner outputs a graph that yields the minimum contrastive loss as the sanitized graph. Our results demonstrate that pruning adversarial edges is feasible on six datasets. EdgePruner can improve the accuracy of node classification under the attack by up to 5.55% compared with that of the state-of-the-art defense. Moreover, we show that EdgePruner is immune to an adaptive attack. ",

    "abstract": "Sequential recommendation (SR) models are typically trained on user-item interactions which are affected by the system exposure bias, leading to the user preference learned from the biased SR model not being fully consistent with the true user preference. Exposure bias refers to the fact that user interactions are dependent upon the partial items exposed to the user. Existing debiasing methods do not make full use of the system exposure data and suffer from sub-optimal recommendation performance and high variance. In this paper, we propose to debias sequential recommenders through Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) over system exposure data. The key idea is to utilize DRO to optimize the worst-case error over an uncertainty set to safeguard the model against distributional discrepancy caused by the exposure bias. The main challenge to apply DRO for exposure debiasing in SR lies in how to construct the uncertainty set and avoid the overestimation of user preference on biased samples. Moreover, how to evaluate the debiasing effect on biased test set is also an open question. To this end, we first introduce an exposure simulator trained upon the system exposure data to calculate the exposure distribution, which is then regarded as the nominal distribution to construct the uncertainty set of DRO. Then, we introduce a penalty to items with high exposure probability to avoid the overestimation of user preference for biased samples. Finally, we design a debiased self-normalized inverse propensity score (SNIPS) evaluator for evaluating the debiasing effect on the biased offline test set. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superior exposure debiasing performance of proposed methods. Codes and data are available at \\url{https://github.com/nancheng58/DebiasedSR_DRO}. ",

    "abstract": "Model inversion (MI) attacks aim to reveal sensitive information in training datasets by solely accessing model weights. Generative MI attacks, a prominent strand in this field, utilize auxiliary datasets to recreate target data attributes, restricting the images to remain photo-realistic, but their success often depends on the similarity between auxiliary and target datasets. If the distributions are dissimilar, existing MI attack attempts frequently fail, yielding unrealistic or target-unrelated results. In response to these challenges, we introduce a groundbreaking approach named Patch-MI, inspired by jigsaw puzzle assembly. To this end, we build upon a new probabilistic interpretation of MI attacks, employing a generative adversarial network (GAN)-like framework with a patch-based discriminator. This approach allows the synthesis of images that are similar to the target dataset distribution, even in cases of dissimilar auxiliary dataset distribution. Moreover, we artfully employ a random transformation block, a sophisticated maneuver that crafts generalized images, thus enhancing the efficacy of the target classifier. Our numerical and graphical findings demonstrate that Patch-MI surpasses existing generative MI methods in terms of accuracy, marking significant advancements while preserving comparable statistical dataset quality.

Differing from exploited the Gaussian distribution to get analytical form of distance measure, we propose a novel oriented regression loss, Wasserstein Distance(EWD) loss, to alleviate the square-like problem. Specifically, for the oriented box(OBox) representation, we choose a specially-designed distribution whose probability density function is only nonzero over the edges. On this basis, we develop Wasserstein distance as the measure. Besides, based on the edge representation of OBox, the EWD loss can be generalized to quadrilateral and polynomial regression scenarios.

Measurements of spherical equivalent and axial length are the gold standards for identifying high myopia, but the available image data for matching them is scarce. In addition, the criteria for defining high myopia vary from study to study, and therefore the inclusion of samples in automated screening efforts requires an appropriate assessment of interpretability. In this work, we propose a model called adjustable robust transformer (ARTran) for high myopia screening of optical coherence tomography (OCT) data. Based on vision transformer, we propose anisotropic patch embedding (APE) to capture more discriminative features of high myopia. To make the model effective under variable screening conditions, we propose an adjustable class embedding (ACE) to replace the fixed class token, which changes the output to adapt to different conditions. Considering the confusion of the data at high myopia and low myopia threshold, we introduce the label noise learning strategy and propose a shifted subspace transition matrix (SST) to enhance the robustness of the model. Besides, combining the two structures proposed above, the model can provide evidence for uncertainty evaluation.

However, existing N:M sparsity methods do not differentiate the relative importance of weights among blocks and leave important weights underappreciated. Besides, they directly apply N:M sparsity to the whole network, which will cause severe information loss. Thus, they are still sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective Multi-Axis Query methodology, dubbed as MaxQ, to rectify these problems. During the training, MaxQ employs a dynamic approach to generate soft N:M masks, considering the weight importance across multiple axes. This method enhances the weights with more importance and ensures more effective updates. Meanwhile, a sparsity strategy that gradually increases the percentage of N:M weight blocks is applied, which allows the network to heal from the pruning-induced damage progressively. During the runtime, the N:M soft masks can be precomputed as constants and folded into weights without causing any distortion to the sparse pattern and incurring additional computational overhead. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MaxQ achieves consistent improvements across diverse CNN architectures in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection and instance segmentation. For ResNet50 with 1:16 sparse pattern, MaxQ can achieve 74.6\\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet and improve by over 2.8\\% over the state-of-the-art. ",

We demand the model to prevent hiders when defending against adversarial examples for improving accuracy and robustness simultaneously. By rethinking and redefining the min-max optimization problem for adversarial training, we propose a generalized adversarial training algorithm called Hider-Focused Adversarial Training (HFAT). HFAT introduces the iterative evolution optimization strategy to simplify the optimization problem and employs an auxiliary model to reveal hiders, effectively combining the optimization directions of standard adversarial training and prevention hiders. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive weighting mechanism that facilitates the model in adaptively adjusting its focus between adversarial examples and hiders during different training periods.

The capacity of LLMs to present erroneous answers in a coherent and semantically rigorous manner further complicates the detection of factual inaccuracies. This issue is especially pronounced in fields that require specialized expertise. Our work delves into these challenges, aiming to enhance the understanding and mitigation of such errors, thereby contributing to the improvement of LLM accuracy and reliability in scientific and other specialized domains. Our findings reveal a non-linear relationship between the context's relevancy and the answers' measured quality. In addition, we demonstrate that with the correct calibration, it is possible to automate the grading procedure -- a finding suggesting that, at least to some degree, the LLMs can be used to self-examine the quality of their own performance. Finally, we describe an experimental platform that can be seen as a proof-of-concept of the techniques described in this work. ",

    "abstract": "It's challenging to balance the networks stability and plasticity in continual learning scenarios, considering stability suffers from the update of model and plasticity benefits from it. Existing works usually focus more on the stability and restrict the learning plasticity of later tasks to avoid catastrophic forgetting of learned knowledge. Differently, we propose a continual learning method named Split2MetaFusion which can achieve better trade-off by employing a two-stage strategy: splitting and meta-weighted fusion. In this strategy, a slow model with better stability, and a fast model with better plasticity are learned sequentially at the splitting stage. Then stability and plasticity are both kept by fusing the two models in an adaptive manner. Towards this end, we design an optimizer named Task-Preferred Null Space Projector(TPNSP) to the slow learning process for narrowing the fusion gap. To achieve better model fusion, we further design a Dreaming-Meta-Weighted fusion policy for better maintaining the old and new knowledge simultaneously, which doesn't require to use the previous datasets. Experimental results and analysis reported in this work demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for maintaining networks stability and keeping its plasticity. Our code will be released. ",

    "abstract": "The impact of outliers and anomalies on model estimation and data processing is of paramount importance, as evidenced by the extensive body of research spanning various fields over several decades: thousands of research papers have been published on the subject. As a consequence, numerous reviews, surveys, and textbooks have sought to summarize the existing literature, encompassing a wide range of methods from both the statistical and data mining communities. While these endeavors to organize and summarize the research are invaluable, they face inherent challenges due to the pervasive nature of outliers and anomalies in all data-intensive applications, irrespective of the specific application field or scientific discipline. As a result, the resulting collection of papers remains voluminous and somewhat heterogeneous. To address the need for knowledge organization in this domain, this paper implements the first systematic meta-survey of general surveys and reviews on outlier and anomaly detection. Employing a classical systematic survey approach, the study collects nearly 500 papers using two specialized scientific search engines. From this comprehensive collection, a subset of 56 papers that claim to be general surveys on outlier detection is selected using a snowball search technique to enhance field coverage. A meticulous quality assessment phase further refines the selection to a subset of 25 high-quality general surveys. Using this curated collection, the paper investigates the evolution of the outlier detection field over a 20-year period, revealing emerging themes and methods. Furthermore, an analysis of the surveys sheds light on the survey writing practices adopted by scholars from different communities who have contributed to this field. Finally, the paper delves into several topics where consensus has emerged from the literature. These include taxonomies of outlier types, challenges posed by high-dimensional data, the importance of anomaly scores, the impact of learning conditions, difficulties in benchmarking, and the significance of neural networks. Non-consensual aspects are also discussed, particularly the distinction between local and global outliers and the challenges in organizing detection methods into meaningful taxonomies. ",

    "abstract": "A temporal graph can be represented by a graph with an edge labelling, such that an edge is present in the network if and only if the edge is assigned the corresponding time label. A journey is a labelled path in a temporal graph such that labels on successive edges of the path are increasing, and if all vertices admit journeys to all other vertices, the temporal graph is temporally connected. A temporal spanner is a sublabelling of the temporal graph such that temporal connectivity is maintained. The study of temporal spanners has raised interest since the early 2000's. Essentially two types of studies have been conducted: the positive side where families of temporal graphs are shown to (deterministically or stochastically) admit sparse temporal spanners, and the negative side where constructions of temporal graphs with no sparse spanners are of importance. Often such studies considered temporal graphs with happy or simple labellings, which associate exactly one label per edge. In this paper, we focus on the negative side and consider proper labellings, where multiple labels per edge are allowed. More precisely, we aim to construct dense temporally connected graphs such that all labels are necessary for temporal connectivity. Our contributions are multiple: we present the first labellings maximizing a local density measure; exact or asymptotically tight results for basic graph families, which are then extended to larger graph families; an extension of an efficient temporal graph labelling generator; and overall denser labellings than previous work even when restricted to happy labellings.

When evaluated on the challenging Baby Intuitions Benchmark, IRENE achieves new state-of-the-art performance on three out of its five tasks - with up to 48.9% improvement.

    "abstract": "In this work, an efficient and robust isogeometric three-dimensional solid-beam finite element is developed for large deformations and finite rotations with merely displacements as degrees of freedom. The finite strain theory and hyperelastic constitutive models are considered and B-Spline and NURBS are employed for the finite element discretization. Similar to finite elements based on Lagrange polynomials, also NURBS-based formulations are affected by the non-physical phenomena of locking, which constrains the field variables and negatively impacts the solution accuracy and deteriorates convergence behavior. To avoid this problem within the context of a Solid-Beam formulation, the Assumed Natural Strain (ANS) method is applied to alleviate membrane and transversal shear locking and the Enhanced Assumed Strain (EAS) method against Poisson thickness locking. Furthermore, the Mixed Integration Point (MIP) method is employed to make the formulation more efficient and robust. The proposed novel isogeometric solid-beam element is tested on several single-patch and multi-patch benchmark problems, and it is validated against classical solid finite elements and isoparametric solid-beam elements. The results show that the proposed formulation can alleviate the locking effects and significantly improve the performance of the isogeometric solid-beam element. With the developed element, efficient and accurate predictions of mechanical properties of lattice-based structured materials can be achieved. The proposed solid-beam element inherits both the merits of solid elements e.g. flexible boundary conditions and of the beam elements i.e. higher computational efficiency. ",

While people have been amazed by the generated results, they have also noticed the reasoning potential reflected in the generated textual content. However, this current ability for causal reasoning is primarily limited to the domain of language generation, such as in models like GPT-3. In visual modality, there is currently no equivalent research. Considering causal reasoning in visual content generation is significant. This is because visual information contains infinite granularity. Particularly, images can provide more intuitive and specific demonstrations for certain reasoning tasks, especially when compared to coarse-grained text. Hence, we propose a new image generation task called visual question answering with image (VQAI) and establish a dataset of the same name based on the classic \\textit{Tom and Jerry} animated series. Additionally, we develop a new paradigm for image generation to tackle the challenges of this task. Finally, we perform extensive experiments and analyses, including visualizations of the generated content and discussions on the potentials and limitations.

Second, we introduce an auxiliary domain classification task to make the diarization model more domain-aware. For seen domains, the combination of our proposed methods reduces the absolute DER from 17.66% to 16.59% when compared with the baseline. During inference, adapters from ground-truth domains are not available for unseen domains. We demonstrate our model exhibits a stronger generalizability to unseen domains when adapters are removed. For two unseen domains, this improves the DER performance from 39.91% to 23.09% and 25.32% to 18.76% over the baseline, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Temporal graphs are dynamic graphs where the edge set can change in each time step, while the vertex set stays the same. Exploration of temporal graphs whose snapshot in each time step is a connected graph, called connected temporal graphs, has been widely studied. In this paper, we extend the concept of graph automorphisms from static graphs to temporal graphs for the first time and show that symmetries enable faster exploration: We prove that a connected temporal graph with $n$ vertices and orbit number $r$ (i.e., $r$~is the number of automorphism orbits) can be explored in $O(r n^{1+\\epsilon})$ time steps, for any fixed $\\epsilon>0$. For $r=O(n^c)$ for constant $c<1$, this is a significant improvement over the known tight worst-case bound of $\\Theta(n^2)$ time steps for arbitrary connected temporal graphs. We also give two lower bounds for temporal exploration, showing that $\\Omega(n \\log n)$ time steps are required for some inputs with $r=O(1)$ and that $\\Omega(rn)$ time steps are required for some inputs for any $r$ with $1\\le r\\le n$. Moreover, we show that the techniques we develop for fast exploration can be used to derive the following result for rendezvous: Two agents with different programs and without communication ability are placed by an adversary at arbitrary vertices and given full information about the connected temporal graph, except that they do not have consistent vertex labels. Then the two agents can meet at a common vertex after $O(n^{1+\\epsilon})$ time steps, for any constant $\\epsilon>0$. For some connected temporal graphs with the orbit number being a constant, we also present a complementary lower bound of $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ time steps. ",

In this work, we investigate the use of neural networks for such online regression and associated Neural Contextual Bandits (NeuCBs). Using existing results for wide networks, one can readily show a ${\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret for online regression with square loss, which via the reduction implies a ${\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{K} T^{3/4})$ regret for NeuCBs. Departing from this standard approach, we first show a $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ regret for online regression with almost convex losses that satisfy QG (Quadratic Growth) condition, a generalization of the PL (Polyak-\\L ojasiewicz) condition, and that have a unique minima. Although not directly applicable to wide networks since they do not have unique minima, we show that adding a suitable small random perturbation to the network predictions surprisingly makes the loss satisfy QG with unique minima. Based on such a perturbed prediction, we show a ${\\mathcal{O}}(\\log T)$ regret for online regression with both squared loss and KL loss, and subsequently convert these respectively to $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{KT})$ and $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{KL^*} + K)$ regret for NeuCB, where $L^*$ is the loss of the best policy. Separately, we also show that existing regret bounds for NeuCBs are $\\Omega(T)$ or assume i.i.d. contexts, unlike this work. Finally, our experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that our algorithms, especially the one based on KL loss, persistently outperform existing algorithms. ",

To address this issue, we propose a novel attack loss framework called the Cost Aware Poisoning Attack (CA-attack) to improve the allocation of the attack budget by dynamically considering the classification margins of nodes. Specifically, it prioritizes nodes with smaller positive margins while postponing nodes with negative margins.

We provide a theoretical analysis for the proposed TIFM method regarding causal effect estimation in longitudinal data. Extensive evaluation with synthetic datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of TIFM in addressing causal effect estimation over time.

The policy network achieves this by learning contextual information to realize whether flow improvement is bottlenecked or minimal. On the one hand, we use iteration embedding and historical hidden cell, which include previous iterations information, to convey how flow has changed from previous iterations. On the other hand, we use the incremental loss to make the policy network implicitly perceive the magnitude of optical flow improvement in the subsequent iteration. Furthermore, the computational complexity in our dynamic network is controllable, allowing us to satisfy various resource preferences with a single trained model. Our policy network can be easily integrated into state-of-the-art optical flow networks.

We give an overview of what differences in modeling are enforced by this more general perspective, and propose an implementation of generalized models in the style of the causal team semantics of Barbero & Sandu (2020). In these models, the laws are not represented by functions (as in the deterministic case), but more generally by relations. We analyze significant differences in the axiomatization of interventionist counterfactuals in the indeterministic vs. the deterministic case, and provide strongly complete axiomatizations over the full class of indeterministic models and over its recursive subclass.

The problem of allocating tasks to a fleet of potentially heterogeneous robots and finding an optimal sequence for each robot is known as multi-robot task assignment (MRTA). Most state-of-the-art methods focus on the problem when the fleet of robots is fixed. In contrast, we consider that we are given a set of available robot types and requested tasks, and need to assemble a fleet that optimally services the tasks while the cost of the fleet remains under a budget limit. We characterize the complexity of the problem and provide a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation. Due to poor scalability of the MILP, we propose a heuristic solution based on a Large Neighbourhood Search (LNS). In simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method requires substantially lower budgets than a greedy algorithm to service all tasks. ",

    "title": "DTA: Distribution Transform-based Attack for Query-Limited Scenario",
    "abstract": "In generating adversarial examples, the conventional black-box attack methods rely on sufficient feedback from the to-be-attacked models by repeatedly querying until the attack is successful, which usually results in thousands of trials during an attack. This may be unacceptable in real applications since Machine Learning as a Service Platform (MLaaS) usually only returns the final result (i.e., hard-label) to the client and a system equipped with certain defense mechanisms could easily detect malicious queries. By contrast, a feasible way is a hard-label attack that simulates an attacked action being permitted to conduct a limited number of queries. To implement this idea, in this paper, we bypass the dependency on the to-be-attacked model and benefit from the characteristics of the distributions of adversarial examples to reformulate the attack problem in a distribution transform manner and propose a distribution transform-based attack (DTA). DTA builds a statistical mapping from the benign example to its adversarial counterparts by tackling the conditional likelihood under the hard-label black-box settings. In this way, it is no longer necessary to query the target model frequently. A well-trained DTA model can directly and efficiently generate a batch of adversarial examples for a certain input, which can be used to attack un-seen models based on the assumed transferability. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that the well-trained DTA model is not sensitive to the semantic spaces of the training dataset, meaning that the model yields acceptable attack performance on other datasets. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed idea and the superiority of DTA over the state-of-the-art. ",

    "abstract": "Representation learning plays a critical role in the analysis of time series data and has high practical value across a wide range of applications. including trend analysis, time series data retrieval and forecasting. In practice, data confusion is a significant issue as it can considerably impact the effectiveness and accuracy of data analysis, machine learning models and decision-making processes. In general, previous studies did not consider the variability at various levels of granularity, thus resulting in inadequate information utilization, which further exacerbated the issue of data confusion. This paper proposes an unsupervised framework to realize multi-granularity representation learning for time series. Specifically, we employed a cross-granularity transformer to develop an association between fine- and coarse-grained representations. In addition, we introduced a retrieval task as an unsupervised training task to learn the multi-granularity representation of time series. Moreover, a novel loss function was designed to obtain the comprehensive multi-granularity representation of the time series via unsupervised learning. The experimental results revealed that the proposed framework demonstrates significant advantages over alternative representation learning models. ",

Furthermore, our expert-based human evaluations demonstrate that the small-sized pre-trained language model (PLM) won over the other two extra-large language models by a large margin, in the clinical domain fine-tuning, which finding was never reported in the field. Finally, the transfer learning method works well in our experimental setting using the WMT21fb model to accommodate a new language space Spanish that was not seen at the pre-training stage within WMT21fb itself, which deserves more exploitation for clinical knowledge transformation, e.g. to investigate into more languages.

Despite the significant progress that has been made recently, existing attack methods still suffer from the unsatisfactory performance of escaping from being detected by naked human eyes due to the formulation of adversarial example (AE) heavily relying on a noise-adding manner. Such mentioned challenges will significantly increase the risk of exposure and result in an attack to be failed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Salient Spatially Transformed Attack (SSTA), a novel framework to craft imperceptible AEs, which enhance the stealthiness of AEs by estimating a smooth spatial transform metric on a most critical area to generate AEs instead of adding external noise to the whole image. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, extensive experiments indicated that SSTA could effectively improve the imperceptibility of the AEs while maintaining a 100\\% attack success rate. ",

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) aims to recognize novel objects whose categories are not included in training set. In order to classify these unseen classes during training, many OVOD frameworks leverage the zero-shot capability of largely pretrained vision and language models, such as CLIP. To further improve generalization on the unseen novel classes, several approaches proposed to additionally train with pseudo region labeling on the external data sources that contain a substantial number of novel category labels beyond the existing training data. Albeit its simplicity, these pseudo-labeling methods still exhibit limited improvement with regard to the genuine novel classes that were not pseudo-labeled. In this paper, we present a novel, yet simple technique that helps generalization on the overall distribution of novel classes. Inspired by our observation that numerous novel classes reside within the convex hull constructed by the base (seen) classes in the CLIP embedding space, we propose to synthesize proxy-novel classes approximating novel classes via linear mixup between a pair of base classes. By training our detector with these synthetic proxy-novel classes, we effectively explore the embedding space of novel classes. The experimental results on various OVOD benchmarks such as LVIS and COCO demonstrate superior performance on novel classes compared to the other state-of-the-art methods. ",

We specifically focus on organisations from the public and critical infrastructure sector who are required to respond to such notifications by law. We find that many organisations are difficult to reach when it concerns security issues, even if they have a security contact point. Additionally, our findings show that having policy in place improves the response and resolution rate, but that even with a policy in place, half of our reports remain unanswered and unsolved after 90~days.

The $\\mathbb{C}$-RSN is designed to address a critical limitation in existing neural network models: their inability to emulate the complex processes of biological neural networks dynamically and accurately. By integrating key concepts from dynamical systems theory and leveraging principles from statistical mechanics, the $\\mathbb{C}$-RSN model introduces localized non-linearity, complex fixed eigenvalues, and a distinct separation of memory and input processing functionalities. These features collectively enable the $\\mathbb{C}$-RSN evolving towards a dynamic, oscillating final state that more closely mirrors biological cognition. Central to this work is the exploration of how the $\\mathbb{C}$-RSN manages to capture the rhythmic, oscillatory dynamics intrinsic to biological systems, thanks to its complex eigenvalue structure and the innovative segregation of its linear and non-linear components. The model's ability to classify data through a time-dependent function, and the localization of information processing, is demonstrated with an empirical evaluation using the MNIST dataset. Remarkably, distinct items supplied as a sequential input yield patterns in time which bear the indirect imprint of the insertion order (and of the time of separation between contiguous insertions).

To facilitate this process, we designed GateNet, the first neural network architecture enabling full end-to-end automated gating without the need to correct for batch effects. We train GateNet with over 8,000,000 events based on N=127 PB and CSF samples which were manually labeled independently by four experts. We show that for novel, unseen samples, GateNet achieves human-level performance (F1 score ranging from 0.910 to 0.997). In addition we apply GateNet to a publicly available dataset confirming generalization with an F1 score of 0.936. As our implementation utilizes graphics processing units (GPU), gating only needs 15 microseconds per event. Importantly, we also show that GateNet only requires ~10 samples to reach human-level performance, rendering it widely applicable in all domains of flow cytometry. ",

In multilingual tasks such as SLID, the pre-trained speech model may not support all the languages in the downstream task. To address this challenge, we propose self-supervised adaptive pre-training (SAPT) to adapt the pre-trained model to the target domain and languages of the downstream task. We apply SAPT to the XLSR-128 model and investigate the effectiveness of this approach for the SLID task. First, we demonstrate that SAPT improves XLSR performance on the FLEURS benchmark with substantial gains up to 40.1% for under-represented languages. Second, we apply SAPT on four different datasets in a few-shot learning setting, showing that our approach improves the sample efficiency of XLSR during fine-tuning. Our experiments provide strong empirical evidence that continual adaptation via self-supervision improves downstream performance for multilingual speech models. ",

On the other hand, borrowing from optimal control theory, we design an optimal linear quadratic control scheme, consisting of a linear feedback term, of the occupancy of the road links, and a feedforward component, which accounts for the varying exogenous vehicle load on the network. Thereby, the resulting control scheme is a simple feedback-feedforward controller, which is fed with occupancy and exogenous demand estimates, and is suitable for real-time implementation.

However, existing studies still suffer from two major limitations: model collapse and weak adversary. This paper addresses these two limitations by proposing collapse-oriented (COLO) adversarial training with triplet decoupling (TRIDE). Specifically, COLO prevents model collapse by temporally orienting the perturbation update direction with a new collapse metric, while TRIDE yields a strong adversary by spatially decoupling the update targets of perturbation into the anchor and the two candidates of a triplet. Experimental results demonstrate that our COLO-TRIDE outperforms the current state of the art by 7% on average over 10 robustness metrics and across 3 popular datasets. In addition, we identify the fairness limitations of commonly used robustness metrics in image retrieval and propose a new metric for more meaningful robustness evaluation.

We design new training objective losses for cases when labeled target data behave as source samples or as real target samples. The underlying rationale is that considering the set of labeled target samples as part of source domain helps reducing the domain discrepancy and, hence, improves the contribution of the adversarial loss. To support our approach, we consider a complementary method that mixes source and labeled target data, then applies the same adaptation process. We further propose an unsupervised selection procedure using entropy to optimize the choice of labeled target samples for adaptation.

    "abstract": "In critical operations where aerial imagery plays an essential role, the integrity and trustworthiness of data are paramount. The emergence of adversarial attacks, particularly those that exploit control over labels or employ physically feasible trojans, threatens to erode that trust, making the analysis and mitigation of these attacks a matter of urgency. We demonstrate how adversarial attacks can degrade confidence in geospatial systems, specifically focusing on scenarios where the attacker's control over labels is restricted and the use of realistic threat vectors. Proposing and evaluating several innovative attack methodologies, including those tailored to overhead images, we empirically show their threat to remote sensing systems using high-quality SpaceNet datasets. Our experimentation reflects the unique challenges posed by aerial imagery, and these preliminary results not only reveal the potential risks but also highlight the non-trivial nature of the problem compared to recent works.

    "abstract": "While Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) has gained attention, its algorithmic robustness, particularly against adversarial perturbations, remains unexplored. Unfortunately, the attacks and robust representation training methods specifically designed for traditional RL are not so effective when applied to GCRL. To address this challenge, we propose the \\textit{Semi-Contrastive Representation} attack, a novel approach inspired by the adversarial contrastive attack. Unlike existing attacks in RL, it only necessitates information from the policy function and can be seamlessly implemented during deployment. Furthermore, to mitigate the vulnerability of existing GCRL algorithms, we introduce \\textit{Adversarial Representation Tactics}. This strategy combines \\textit{Semi-Contrastive Adversarial Augmentation} with \\textit{Sensitivity-Aware Regularizer}. It improves the adversarial robustness of the underlying agent against various types of perturbations. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our attack and defence mechanism across multiple state-of-the-art GCRL algorithms.

In this paper, we cope with this problem by introducing a coarse-graining algorithm. It leads to an aggregated network which satisfies control equivalence, i.e., such that the optimal control values for the original network can be exactly recovered from those of the aggregated one. The algorithm is based on a partition refinement method originally devised for systems of ordinary differential equations, here extended and applied to linear dynamics on complex networks.

    "abstract": "Conformal prediction is a statistical tool for producing prediction regions for machine learning models that are valid with high probability. A key component of conformal prediction algorithms is a non-conformity score function that quantifies how different a model's prediction is from the unknown ground truth value. Essentially, these functions determine the shape and the size of the conformal prediction regions. However, little work has gone into finding non-conformity score functions that produce prediction regions that are multi-modal and practical, i.e., that can efficiently be used in engineering applications. We propose a method that optimizes parameterized shape template functions over calibration data, which results in non-conformity score functions that produce prediction regions with minimum volume. Our approach results in prediction regions that are multi-modal, so they can properly capture residuals of distributions that have multiple modes, and practical, so each region is convex and can be easily incorporated into downstream tasks, such as a motion planner using conformal prediction regions. Our method applies to general supervised learning tasks, while we illustrate its use in time-series prediction. We provide a toolbox and present illustrative case studies of F16 fighter jets and autonomous vehicles, showing an up to $68\\%$ reduction in prediction region area. ",

Indeed, a well-balanced trade-off between performance and energy consumption is crucial for the sustainability of autonomous vehicles. In this context, the diversity of real-world contexts in which autonomous vehicles can operate motivates the need for empowering perception models with the capability to detect, characterize and identify newly appearing objects by themselves. In this manuscript we elaborate on this threefold conundrum (performance, efficiency and open-world learning) for object detection modeling tasks over image data collected from vehicular scenarios. Specifically, we show that well-performing and efficient models can be realized by virtue of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), reaching competitive levels of detection performance when compared to their non-spiking counterparts at dramatic energy consumption savings (up to 85%) and a slightly improved robustness against image noise. Our experiments herein offered also expose qualitatively the complexity of detecting new objects based on the preliminary results of a simple approach to discriminate potential object proposals in the captured image.

One of the most important imperatives in this path is the availability of quality data to feed all the process in digital transformation.

Within this context of digital transformation of grocery industry, \\textit{Midiadia} is Spanish data provider company that works on converting data from the retailers' products into knowledge with attributes and insights from the product labels, that is, maintaining quality data in a dynamic market with a high dispersion of products. Currently, they manually categorize products (groceries) according to the information extracted directly (text processing) from the product labelling and packaging. This paper introduces a solution to automatically categorize the constantly changing product catalogue into a 3-level food taxonomy. Our proposal studies three different approaches: a score-based ranking method, traditional machine learning algorithms, and deep neural networks. Thus, we provide four different classifiers that support a more efficient and less error-prone maintenance of groceries catalogues, the main asset of the company. Finally, we have compared the performance of these three alternatives, concluding that traditional machine learning algorithms perform better, but closely followed by the score-based approach. ",

In addressing the demands of this critical task, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have emerged as a valuable resource, leveraging their efficiency in circumventing the need for a large number of annotations, which can be both costly and time-consuming to deploy supervised methods. Nevertheless, patch-wise representation may exhibit instability in performance, primarily due to class imbalances stemming from patch selection within WSIs. In this paper, we introduce Nearby Patch Contrastive Learning (NearbyPatchCL), a novel self-supervised learning method that leverages nearby patches as positive samples and a decoupled contrastive loss for robust representation learning. Our method demonstrates a tangible enhancement in performance for downstream tasks involving patch-level multi-class classification. Additionally, we curate a new dataset derived from WSIs sourced from the Canine Cutaneous Cancer Histology, thus establishing a benchmark for the rigorous evaluation of patch-level multi-class classification methodologies. Intensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms the supervised baseline and state-of-the-art SSL methods with top-1 classification accuracy of 87.56%.

    "abstract": "This work studies the recently proposed challenging and practical Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (MUAD) task, which only requires normal images for training while simultaneously testing both normal/anomaly images for multiple classes. Existing reconstruction-based methods typically adopt pyramid networks as encoders/decoders to obtain multi-resolution features, accompanied by elaborate sub-modules with heavier handcraft engineering designs for more precise localization. In contrast, a plain Vision Transformer (ViT) with simple architecture has been shown effective in multiple domains, which is simpler, more effective, and elegant. Following this spirit, this paper explores plain ViT architecture for MUAD. Specifically, we abstract a Meta-AD concept by inducing current reconstruction-based methods. Then, we instantiate a novel and elegant plain ViT-based symmetric ViTAD structure, effectively designed step by step from three macro and four micro perspectives. In addition, this paper reveals several interesting findings for further exploration. Finally, we propose a comprehensive and fair evaluation benchmark on eight metrics for the MUAD task. Based on a naive training recipe, ViTAD achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and efficiency on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets without bells and whistles, obtaining 85.4 mAD that surpasses SoTA UniAD by +3.0, and only requiring 1.1 hours and 2.3G GPU memory to complete model training by a single V100 GPU.

A lot of research has been conducted to provide machines with the ability to recognize emotions in photos of people. Previous methods mostly focus on facial expressions but fail to consider the scene context, meanwhile scene context plays an important role in predicting emotions, leading to more accurate results. In addition, Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) values offer a more precise quantitative understanding of continuous emotions, yet there has been less emphasis on predicting them compared to discrete emotional categories. In this paper, we present a novel Multi-Branch Network (MBN), which utilizes various source information, including faces, bodies, and scene contexts to predict both discrete and continuous emotions in an image. Experimental results on EMOTIC dataset, which contains large-scale images of people in unconstrained situations labeled with 26 discrete categories of emotions and VAD values, show that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with 28.4% in mAP and 0.93 in MAE. The results highlight the importance of utilizing multiple contextual information in emotion prediction and illustrate the potential of our proposed method in a wide range of applications, such as effective computing, human-computer interaction, and social robotics.

We propose a method known as Neighborhood Attention with Convolutions TCN (NAC-TCN) which incorporates the benefits of attention and Temporal Convolutional Networks while ensuring that causal relationships are understood which results in a reduction in computation and memory cost. We accomplish this by introducing a causal version of Dilated Neighborhood Attention while incorporating it with convolutions.

Unlike prior work which still relies on few accurate 3D annotations, we propose a framework to study how to leverage constraints between 2D and 3D domains without requiring any 3D labels. Specifically, we employ visual data from three perspectives to establish connections between 2D and 3D domains. First, we design a feature-level constraint to align LiDAR and image features based on object-aware regions. Second, the output-level constraint is developed to enforce the overlap between 2D and projected 3D box estimations. Finally, the training-level constraint is utilized by producing accurate and consistent 3D pseudo-labels that align with the visual data. We conduct extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed three constraints. Without using any 3D labels, our method achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art approaches and is competitive with the method that uses 500-frame 3D annotations.

Fitting the resulting model to a large collection of data sets we estimate depth and luck in a range of games, sports, and social situations. In general, we find that social competition tends to be \"deep,\" meaning it has a pronounced hierarchy with many distinct levels, but also that there is often a nonzero chance of an upset victory, meaning that dominance challenges can be won even by significant underdogs. Competition in sports and games, by contrast, tends to be shallow and in most cases there is little evidence of upset wins, beyond those already implied by the shallowness of the hierarchy. ",

    "abstract": "The advent of artificial intelligence, especially the progress of deep neural networks, is expected to revolutionize genetic research and offer unprecedented potential to decode the complex relationships between genetic variants and disease phenotypes, which could mark a significant step toward improving our understanding of the disease etiology. While deep neural networks hold great promise for genetic association analysis, limited research has been focused on developing neural-network-based tests to dissect complex genotype-phenotype associations. This complexity arises from the opaque nature of neural networks and the absence of defined limiting distributions. We have previously developed a kernel-based neural network model (KNN) that synergizes the strengths of linear mixed models with conventional neural networks. KNN adopts a computationally efficient minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimator (MINQUE) algorithm and uses KNN structure to capture the complex relationship between large-scale sequencing data and a disease phenotype of interest. In the KNN framework, we introduce a MINQUE-based test to assess the joint association of genetic variants with the phenotype, which considers non-linear and non-additive effects and follows a mixture of chi-square distributions. We also construct two additional tests to evaluate and interpret linear and non-linear/non-additive genetic effects, including interaction effects. Our simulations show that our method consistently controls the type I error rate under various conditions and achieves greater power than a commonly used sequence kernel association test (SKAT), especially when involving non-linear and interaction effects. When applied to real data from the UK Biobank, our approach identified genes associated with hippocampal volume, which can be further replicated and evaluated for their role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

Wherein, the backward compatible PINN (bc-PINN) is a temporally sequential scheme to solve PDEs over successive time segments while satisfying all previously obtained solutions. In this work, we propose improvements to the original bc-PINN algorithm in two aspects based on the characteristics of error propagation. One is to modify the loss term for ensuring backward compatibility by selecting the earliest learned solution for each sub-domain as pseudo reference solution. The other is to adopt the concatenation of solutions obtained from individual subnetworks as the final form of the predicted solution. The improved backward compatible PINN (Ibc-PINN) is applied to study data-driven higher-order rogue waves for the nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation and the AB system to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages. Transfer learning and initial condition guided learning (ICGL) techniques are also utilized to accelerate the training. Moreover, the error analysis is conducted on each sub-domain and it turns out that the slowdown of Ibc-PINN in error accumulation speed can yield greater advantages in accuracy. In short, numerical results fully indicate that Ibc-PINN significantly outperforms bc-PINN in terms of accuracy and stability without sacrificing efficiency. ",

    "title": "WE economy: Potential of mutual aid distribution based on moral  responsibility and risk vulnerability",
    "abstract": "Reducing wealth inequality and disparity is a global challenge. The economic system is mainly divided into (1) gift and reciprocity, (2) power and redistribution, (3) market exchange, and (4) mutual aid without reciprocal obligations. The current inequality stems from a capitalist economy consisting of (2) and (3). To sublimate (1), which is the human economy, to (4), the concept of a \"mixbiotic society\" has been proposed in the philosophical realm. This is a society in which free and diverse individuals, \"I,\" mix with each other, recognize their respective \"fundamental incapability\" and sublimate them into \"WE\" solidarity. The economy in this society must have moral responsibility as a coadventurer and consideration for vulnerability to risk. Therefore, I focus on two factors of mind perception: moral responsibility and risk vulnerability, and propose a novel model of wealth distribution following an econophysical approach. Specifically, I developed a joint-venture model, a redistribution model in the joint-venture model, and a \"WE economy\" model. A simulation comparison of a combination of the joint ventures and redistribution with the WE economies reveals that WE economies are effective in reducing inequality and resilient in normalizing wealth distribution as advantages, and susceptible to free riders as disadvantages. However, this disadvantage can be compensated for by fostering consensus and fellowship, and by complementing it with joint ventures. This study essentially presents the effectiveness of moral responsibility, the complementarity between the WE economy and the joint economy, and the direction of the economy toward reducing inequality. Future challenges are to develop the WE economy model based on real economic analysis and psychology, as well as to promote WE economy fieldwork for worker coops and platform cooperatives to realize a desirable mixbiotic society.

    "title": "MS-Twins: Multi-Scale Deep Self-Attention Networks for Medical Image  Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Although transformer is preferred in natural language processing, few studies have applied it in the field of medical imaging. For its long-term dependency, the transformer is expected to contribute to unconventional convolution neural net conquer their inherent spatial induction bias. The lately suggested transformer-based partition method only uses the transformer as an auxiliary module to help encode the global context into a convolutional representation. There is hardly any study about how to optimum bond self-attention (the kernel of transformers) with convolution. To solve the problem, the article proposes MS-Twins (Multi-Scale Twins), which is a powerful segmentation model on account of the bond of self-attention and convolution. MS-Twins can better capture semantic and fine-grained information by combining different scales and cascading features. Compared with the existing network structure, MS-Twins has made significant progress on the previous method based on the transformer of two in common use data sets, Synapse and ACDC. In particular, the performance of MS-Twins on Synapse is 8% higher than SwinUNet. Even compared with nnUNet, the best entirely convoluted medical image segmentation network, the performance of MS-Twins on Synapse and ACDC still has a bit advantage. ",

    "abstract": "The transit method is one of the most relevant exoplanet detection techniques, which consists of detecting periodic eclipses in the light curves of stars. This is not always easy due to the presence of noise in the light curves, which is induced, for example, by the response of a telescope to stellar flux. For this reason, we aimed to develop an artificial neural network model that is able to detect these transits in light curves obtained from different telescopes and surveys. We created artificial light curves with and without transits to try to mimic those expected for the extended mission of the Kepler telescope (K2) in order to train and validate a 1D convolutional neural network model, which was later tested, obtaining an accuracy of 99.02 % and an estimated error (loss function) of 0.03. These results, among others, helped to confirm that the 1D CNN is a good choice for working with non-phased-folded Mandel and Agol light curves with transits. It also reduces the number of light curves that have to be visually inspected to decide if they present transit-like signals and decreases the time needed for analyzing each (with respect to traditional analysis).

    "abstract": "We study control of constrained linear systems when faced with only partial statistical information about the disturbance processes affecting the system dynamics and the sensor measurements. Specifically, given a finite collection of disturbance realizations, we consider the problem of designing a stabilizing control policy with provable safety and performance guarantees in face of the inevitable mismatch between the true and the empirical distributions. We capture this discrepancy using Wasserstein ambiguity sets, and we formulate a distributionally robust (DR) optimal control problem, which provides guarantees on the expected cost, safety, and stability of the system. To solve this problem, we first present new results for DR optimization of quadratic objectives using convex programming, showing that strong duality holds under mild conditions. Then, by combining our results with the system level parametrization (SLP) of linear feedback policies, we show that the design problem can be reduced to a semidefinite optimization problem (SDP). ",

By providing complementary information, it becomes instrumental in fortifying safe decisions, particularly within high-risk applications. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the advantages and limitations inherent in various methods within the medical imaging field necessitates further research coupled with in-depth analysis. In this paper, we explore Conformal Prediction, an emerging distribution-free uncertainty quantification technique, along with Monte Carlo Dropout and Evidential Deep Learning methods. Our comprehensive experiments provide a comparative performance analysis for skin lesion classification tasks across the three quantification methods. Furthermore, We present insights into the effectiveness of each method in handling Out-of-Distribution samples from domain-shifted datasets. Based on our experimental findings, our conclusion highlights the robustness and consistent performance of conformal prediction across diverse conditions. This positions it as the preferred choice for decision-making in safety-critical applications. ",

    "abstract": "Neuro-steered speaker extraction aims to extract the listener's brain-attended speech signal from a multi-talker speech signal, in which the attention is derived from the cortical activity. This activity is usually recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) devices. Though promising, current methods often have a high speaker confusion error, where the interfering speaker is extracted instead of the attended speaker, degrading the listening experience. In this work, we aim to reduce the speaker confusion error in the neuro-steered speaker extraction model through a jointly fine-tuned auxiliary auditory attention detection model. The latter reinforces the consistency between the extracted target speech signal and the EEG representation, and also improves the EEG representation. Experimental results show that the proposed network significantly outperforms the baseline in terms of speaker confusion and overall signal quality in two-talker scenarios. ",
