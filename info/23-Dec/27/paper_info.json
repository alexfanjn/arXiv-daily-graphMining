    "abstract": "A new network named the \"Digital Twin Network\" (DTN) uses the \"Digital Twin\" (DT) technology to produce virtual twins of real things. The network load and size continue to grow as a result of the development of 5G, the Internet of Things, and cloud computing technology as well as the advent of new network services. As a result, network operation and maintenance are becoming more difficult. A digital twin connects the real and digital worlds, exchanging data in both directions and revealing information about the progression of a network process. The framework of the Industrial Internet of Things, data processing, and digital twin network is taken into consideration in this article as a key aspect. This paper proposed a data-driven digital twin network architecture, that comprises the physical network layer (PNL), the digital twin layer(DTL), the application layer (AL), and what those layers encompass and beyond. Also, we presented DTN data types and protocols to be used for data integration. ",

    "abstract": "Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to develop transparent explanatory approaches for \"black-box\" deep learning models. However,it remains difficult for existing methods to achieve the trade-off of the three key criteria in interpretability, namely, reliability, causality, and usability, which hinder their practical applications. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised automatic semantic interpretable explainable artificial intelligence (AS-XAI) framework, which utilizes transparent orthogonal embedding semantic extraction spaces and row-centered principal component analysis (PCA) for global semantic interpretation of model decisions in the absence of human interference, without additional computational costs. In addition, the invariance of filter feature high-rank decomposition is used to evaluate model sensitivity to different semantic concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that robust and orthogonal semantic spaces can be automatically extracted by AS-XAI, providing more effective global interpretability for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and generating human-comprehensible explanations. The proposed approach offers broad fine-grained extensible practical applications, including shared semantic interpretation under out-of-distribution (OOD) categories, auxiliary explanations for species that are challenging to distinguish, and classification explanations from various perspectives.

    "abstract": "As part of their training all medical students and residents have to pass basic surgical tasks such as knot tying, needle-passing, and suturing. Their assessment is typically performed in the operating room by surgical faculty where mistakes and failure by the student increases the operation time and cost. This evaluation is quantitative and has a low margin of error. Simulation has emerged as a cost effective option but it lacks assessment or requires additional expensive hardware for evaluation. Apps that provide training videos on surgical knot trying are available to students but none have evaluation. We propose a cascaded neural network architecture that evaluates a student's performance just from a video of themselves simulating a surgical knot tying task. Our model converts video frame images into feature vectors with a pre-trained deep convolutional network and then models the sequence of frames with a temporal network. We obtained videos of medical students and residents from the Robert Wood Johnson Hospital performing knot tying on a standardized simulation kit. We manually annotated each video and proceeded to do a five-fold cross-validation study on them. Our model achieves a median precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.71, 0.66, and 0.65 respectively in determining the level of knot related tasks of tying and pushing the knot. Our mean precision score averaged across different probability thresholds is 0.8. Both our F1-score and mean precision score are 8% and 30% higher than that of a recently published study for the same problem. We expect the accuracy of our model to further increase as we add more training videos to the model thus making it a practical solution that students can use to evaluate themselves. ",

To improve the privacy and prevent eavesdropping attacks, we propose a user scheduling algorithm to schedule users satisfying an instantaneous minimum secrecy rate constraint. Based on this, we optimize the bandwidth allocations with three algorithms namely iterative search (IvS), GNN-based supervised learning (GNN-SL), and GNN-based unsupervised learning (GNN-USL). We present a computational complexity analysis which shows that GNN-SL and GNN-USL can be more efficient compared to IvS which is limited by the bandwidth block size. Numerical simulation results highlight that our proposed GNN-based resource allocations can achieve a comparable sum secrecy rate compared to IvS with significantly lower computational complexity. Furthermore, we observe that the GNN approach is more robust to uncertainties in the eavesdropper's channel state information, especially compared with the best channel allocation scheme. ",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aided content management system in communication-challenged disaster scenarios. Without cellular infrastructure in such scenarios, community of stranded users can be provided access to situation-critical contents using a hybrid network of static and traveling UAVs. A set of relatively static anchor UAVs can download content from central servers and provide content access to its local users. A set of ferrying UAVs with wider mobility can provision content to users by shuffling them across different anchor UAVs while visiting different communities of users. The objective is to design a content dissemination system that on-the-fly learns content caching policies for maximizing content availability to the stranded users. This paper proposes a decentralized Top-k Multi-Armed Bandit Learning model for UAV-caching decision-making that takes geo-temporal differences in content popularity and heterogeneity in content demands into consideration. The proposed paradigm is able to combine the expected reward maximization attribute and a proposed multi-dimensional reward structure of Top-k Multi-Armed Bandit, for caching decision at the UAVs. This study is done for different user-specified tolerable access delay, heterogeneous popularity distributions, and inter-community geographical characteristics. Functional verification and performance evaluation of the proposed caching framework is done for a wide range of network size, UAV distribution, and content popularity. ",

(2021) first proposed a DNN-based approach to learn Lagrangian representations and demonstrated accurate particle tracing for an analytic 2D flow field. In this paper, we extend and build upon this prior work in significant ways. First, we evaluate the performance of DNN models to accurately trace particles in various settings, including 2D and 3D time-varying flow fields, flow fields from multiple applications, flow fields with varying complexity, as well as structured and unstructured input data. Second, we conduct an empirical study to inform best practices with respect to particle tracing model architectures, activation functions, and training data structures. Third, we conduct a comparative evaluation against prior techniques that employ flow maps as input for exploratory flow visualization. Specifically, we compare our extended model against its predecessor by Han et al. (2021), as well as the conventional approach that uses triangulation and Barycentric coordinate interpolation. Finally, we consider the integration and adaptation of our particle tracing model with different viewers. We provide an interactive web-based visualization interface by leveraging the efficiencies of our framework, and perform high-fidelity interactive visualization by integrating it with an OSPRay-based viewer. Overall, our experiments demonstrate that using a trained DNN model to predict new particle trajectories requires a low memory footprint and results in rapid inference. Following the best practices for large 3D datasets, our deep learning approach is shown to require approximately 46 times less memory while being more than 400 times faster than the conventional methods.

I evaluate this architecture, referred to as a \"stacked tensorial neural network\" (STNN), on a parametric PDE with three independent variables and three parameters.

The STNN provides an accurate reduced-order description of the solution manifold over a wide range of parameters. There is also evidence of meaningful generalization to parameter values outside its training data.

Our model, named TPTNet uses only 2m temperature measured at the weather stations of the South Korean Peninsula as input to predict the local temperature at finite forecast hours. The turbulent fluctuation component of the temperature was extracted from the station measurements by separating the climatology component accounting for the yearly and daily variations. The effect of station altitude was then compensated by introducing a potential temperature. The resulting turbulent potential temperature data at irregularly distributed stations were used as input for predicting the turbulent potential temperature at forecast hours through three trained networks based on convolutional neural network (CNN), Swin Transformer, and a graphic neural network (GNN). The prediction performance of our network was compared with that of persistence and NWP, confirming that our model outperformed NWP for up to 12 forecast hours. ",

    "abstract": "Our online lives generate a wealth of behavioral records -'digital footprints'- which are stored and leveraged by technology platforms. This data can be used to create value for users by personalizing services. At the same time, however, it also poses a threat to people's privacy by offering a highly intimate window into their private traits (e.g., their personality, political ideology, sexual orientation). Prior work has proposed a potential remedy: The cloaking of users' footprints. That is, platforms could allow users to hide portions of their digital footprints from predictive algorithms to avoid undesired inferences. While such an approach has been shown to offer privacy protection in the moment, there are two open questions. First, it remains unclear how well cloaking performs over time. As people constantly leave new digital footprints, the algorithm might regain the ability to predict previously cloaked traits. Second, cloaking digital footprints to avoid one undesirable inference may degrade the performance of models for other, desirable inferences (e.g., those driving desired personalized content). In the light of these research gaps, our contributions are twofold: 1) We propose a novel cloaking strategy that conceals 'metafeatures' (automatically generated higher-level categories) and compares its effectiveness against existing cloaking approaches, and 2) we test the spill-over effects of cloaking one trait on the accuracy of inferences on other traits. A key finding is that the effectiveness of cloaking degrades over times, but the rate at which it degrades is significantly smaller when cloaking metafeatures rather than individual footprints. In addition, our findings reveal the expected trade-off between privacy and personalization: Cloaking an undesired trait also partially conceals other desirable traits. ",

C2FAR generates a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine discretization of a variable autoregressively; progressively finer intervals of support are generated from a sequence of binned distributions, where each distribution is conditioned on previously-generated coarser intervals. Unlike prior (flat) binned distributions, C2FAR can represent values with exponentially higher precision, for only a linear increase in complexity. We use C2FAR for probabilistic forecasting via a recurrent neural network, thus modeling time series autoregressively in both space and time. C2FAR is the first method to simultaneously handle discrete and continuous series of arbitrary scale and distribution shape. This flexibility enables a variety of time series use cases, including anomaly detection, interpolation, and compression. C2FAR achieves improvements over the state-of-the-art on several benchmark forecasting datasets. ",

Theory, 2016, in which a server is connected to $K_1$ mirrors, and each mirror is connected to $K_2$ users. The mirrors and the users are equipped with the cache of size $M_1$ and $M_2$, respectively. We propose a hierarchical coded caching scheme with coded placements that perform better than the existing schemes. In order to ensure a fair comparison with existing schemes, we introduce the notion of composite rate, defined as $\\overline{R}=R_1+K_1R_2$, which consists of the rate from server to mirrors $R_1$ and the rate from mirror to users $R_2$. The composite rate has not been discussed before in literature and it represents the total consumed bandwidth in the system. Therefore, it is more appropriate to consider the composite rate along with $R_1$ and $R_2$. For the proposed scheme, we show a trade-off between the global memory $\\overline{M}=K_1M_1+K_1K_2M_2$ of the system and the composite rate. We compare the proposed scheme with the existing hierarchical coded caching schemes using the proposed parameter composite rate.

Unit tests can live in the source code and include digital ASCII waveforms representing the simulator's output. Hardcaml also provides tools for SAT proving and formal verification.

To address this challenge, we propose GroundVLP, a simple yet effective zero-shot method that harnesses visual grounding ability from the existing models trained from image-text pairs and pure object detection data, both of which are more conveniently obtainable and offer a broader domain compared to visual grounding annotation data. GroundVLP proposes a fusion mechanism that combines the heatmap from GradCAM and the object proposals of open-vocabulary detectors.

    "abstract": "One goal of technical online communities is to help developers find the right answer in one place. A single question can be asked in different ways with different wordings, leading to the existence of duplicate posts on technical forums. The question of how to discover and link duplicate posts has garnered the attention of both developer communities and researchers. For example, Stack Overflow adopts a voting-based mechanism to mark and close duplicate posts. However, addressing these constantly emerging duplicate posts in a timely manner continues to pose challenges. Therefore, various approaches have been proposed to detect duplicate posts on technical forum posts automatically. The existing methods suffer from limitations either due to their reliance on handcrafted similarity metrics which can not sufficiently capture the semantics of posts, or their lack of supervision to improve the performance. Additionally, the efficiency of these methods is hindered by their dependence on pair-wise feature generation, which can be impractical for large amount of data. In this work, we attempt to employ and refine the GPT-3 embeddings for the duplicate detection task. We assume that the GPT-3 embeddings can accurately represent the semantics of the posts. In addition, by training a Siamese-based network based on the GPT-3 embeddings, we obtain a latent embedding that accurately captures the duplicate relation in technical forum posts. Our experiment on a benchmark dataset confirms the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline methods. When applied to the dataset we constructed with a recent Stack Overflow dump, our approach attains a Top-1, Top-5, and Top-30 accuracy of 23.1%, 43.9%, and 68.9%, respectively. With a manual study, we confirm our approach's potential of finding unlabelled duplicates on technical forums. ",

    "abstract": "As deep neural networks are increasingly deployed in sensitive application domains, such as healthcare and security, it's necessary to understand what kind of sensitive information can be inferred from these models. Existing model-targeted attacks all assume the attacker has known the application domain or training data distribution, which plays an essential role in successful attacks. Can removing the domain information from model APIs protect models from these attacks? This paper studies this critical problem. Unfortunately, even with minimal knowledge, i.e., accessing the model as an unnamed function without leaking the meaning of input and output, the proposed adaptive domain inference attack (ADI) can still successfully estimate relevant subsets of training data. We show that the extracted relevant data can significantly improve, for instance, the performance of model-inversion attacks. Specifically, the ADI method utilizes a concept hierarchy built on top of a large collection of available public and private datasets and a novel algorithm to adaptively tune the likelihood of leaf concepts showing up in the unseen training data. The ADI attack not only extracts partial training data at the concept level, but also converges fast and requires much fewer target-model accesses than another domain inference attack, GDI. ",

We present an unsupervised deep learning framework that derives meaningful representation from textual features for developing semantic entrainment. We investigate the model's performance by extracting features using different variations of the BERT model (DistilBERT and XLM-RoBERTa) and Google's universal sentence encoder (USE) embeddings on two human-human (HH) corpora (The Fisher Corpus English Part 1, Columbia games corpus) and one human-machine (HM) corpus (Voice Assistant Conversation Corpus (VACC)). In addition to semantic features we also trained DNN-based models utilizing two auditory embeddings (TRIpLet Loss network (TRILL) vectors, Low-level descriptors (LLD) features) and two units of analysis (Inter pausal unit and Turn). The results show that semantic entrainment can be assessed with our model, that models can distinguish between HH and HM interactions and that the two units of analysis for extracting acoustic features provide comparable findings.

Guaranteeing the delay-sensitive application in Wi-Fi is always challenging due to the nature of unlicensed spectrum. As the device ecosystem keeps growing and expanding, all the current and future devices can support both Wi-Fi and Private Cellular Network (CBRS is the primary spectrum in the US for private network deployment). However, due to the existing infrastructure and huge investment in the dense Wi-Fi network, consumers prefer two deployment models. The first scenario is deploying the private network outdoors and using the existing Wi-Fi indoors. The second scenario is to use the existing Wi-Fi network as a backup for offloading the traffic indoors and parallely utilizes the private network deployment for less latency applications. Hence, we expect, in both scenarios, a roaming between two technologies \\emph{i.e.,} Wi-Fi and Private Cellular Network. In this work, we would like to quantify the roaming performance or service interruption time when the device moves from Wi-Fi to Private Network (CBRS) and vice-versa. ",

However, the original node2vec algorithm typically relies on a batch training of graph structures; thus, it is not suited for applications in which the graph structure changes after the deployment. In this paper, we focus on node2vec applications for IoT (Internet of Things) environments. To handle the changes of graph structures after the IoT devices have been deployed in edge environments, in this paper we propose to combine an online sequential training algorithm with node2vec. The proposed sequentially-trainable model is implemented on a resource-limited FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) device to demonstrate the benefits of our approach. The proposed FPGA implementation achieves up to 205.25 times speedup compared to the original model on CPU. Evaluation results using dynamic graphs show that although the original model decreases the accuracy, the proposed sequential model can obtain better graph embedding that can increase the accuracy even when the graph structure is changed.

Consider an undirected graph where each node has a strict linear order over a set of $\\alpha$ alternatives. At each round, a node randomly selects two adjacent alternatives and updates their relative order with the majority view of its neighbors. We bound the convergence time of the process in terms of the number of nodes/edges and $\\alpha$. Furthermore, we study the minimum cost to ensure that a desired alternative will ``win'' the process, where occupying each position in a preference order of a node has a cost. We prove tight bounds on the minimum cost for general graphs and graphs with strong expansion properties. Furthermore, we investigate a more light-weight process where each node chooses one of its neighbors uniformly at random and copies its order fully with some fixed probability and remains unchanged otherwise. We characterize the convergence properties of this process, namely convergence time and stable states, using Martingale and reversible Markov chain analysis. Finally, we present the outcomes of our experiments conducted on different synthetic random graph models and graph data from online social platforms. These experiments not only support our theoretical findings, but also shed some light on some other fundamental problems, such as designing powerful countermeasures. ",

    "abstract": "Reservoir computing, using nonlinear dynamical systems, offers a cost-effective alternative to neural networks for complex tasks involving processing of sequential data, time series modeling, and system identification. Echo state networks (ESNs), a type of reservoir computer, mirror neural networks but simplify training. They apply fixed, random linear transformations to the internal state, followed by nonlinear changes. This process, guided by input signals and linear regression, adapts the system to match target characteristics, reducing computational demands. A potential drawback of ESNs is that the fixed reservoir may not offer the complexity needed for specific problems. While directly altering (training) the internal ESN would reintroduce the computational burden, an indirect modification can be achieved by redirecting some output as input. This feedback can influence the internal reservoir state, yielding ESNs with enhanced complexity suitable for broader challenges. In this paper, we demonstrate that by feeding some component of the reservoir state back into the network through the input, we can drastically improve upon the performance of a given ESN. We rigorously prove that, for any given ESN, feedback will almost always improve the accuracy of the output. For a set of three tasks, each representing different problem classes, we find that with feedback the average error measures are reduced by $30\\%-60\\%$. Remarkably, feedback provides at least an equivalent performance boost to doubling the initial number of computational nodes, a computationally expensive and technologically challenging alternative. These results demonstrate the broad applicability and substantial usefulness of this feedback scheme. ",

Leveraging human expertise and experience with AI in intelligent systems can be efficient and beneficial.

In this work, we show that learning from humans is effective and that human-AI collaboration outperforms human-controlled and fully autonomous AI agents in a complex simulation environment. In addition, we have developed a new simulator for critical infrastructure protection, focusing on a scenario where AI-powered drones and human teams collaborate to defend an airport against enemy drone attacks. We develop a user interface to allow humans to assist AI agents effectively. We demonstrated that agents learn faster while learning from policy correction compared to learning from humans or agents. Furthermore, human-AI collaboration requires lower mental and temporal demands, reduces human effort, and yields higher performance than if humans directly controlled all agents. In conclusion, we show that humans can provide helpful advice to the RL agents, allowing them to improve learning in a multi-agent setting. ",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained vision models (PVMs) have become a dominant component due to their exceptional performance when fine-tuned for downstream tasks. However, the presence of backdoors within PVMs poses significant threats. Unfortunately, existing studies primarily focus on backdooring PVMs for the classification task, neglecting potential inherited backdoors in downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. In this paper, we propose the Pre-trained Trojan attack, which embeds backdoors into a PVM, enabling attacks across various downstream vision tasks. We highlight the challenges posed by cross-task activation and shortcut connections in successful backdoor attacks. To achieve effective trigger activation in diverse tasks, we stylize the backdoor trigger patterns with class-specific textures, enhancing the recognition of task-irrelevant low-level features associated with the target class in the trigger pattern. Moreover, we address the issue of shortcut connections by introducing a context-free learning pipeline for poison training. In this approach, triggers without contextual backgrounds are directly utilized as training data, diverging from the conventional use of clean images. Consequently, we establish a direct shortcut from the trigger to the target class, mitigating the shortcut connection issue. We conducted extensive experiments to thoroughly validate the effectiveness of our attacks on downstream detection and segmentation tasks. Additionally, we showcase the potential of our approach in more practical scenarios, including large vision models and 3D object detection in autonomous driving. This paper aims to raise awareness of the potential threats associated with applying PVMs in practical scenarios. Our codes will be available upon paper publication. ",

Recent social science research has explored the use of these \"black-box\" LLM agents for simulating complex social systems and potentially substituting human subjects in experiments. Our study delves into this emerging domain, investigating the extent to which LLMs exhibit key social interaction principles, such as social learning, social preference, and cooperative behavior, in their interactions with humans and other agents. We develop a novel framework for our study, wherein classical laboratory experiments involving human subjects are adapted to use LLM agents. This approach involves step-by-step reasoning that mirrors human cognitive processes and zero-shot learning to assess the innate preferences of LLMs. Our analysis of LLM agents' behavior includes both the primary effects and an in-depth examination of the underlying mechanisms. Focusing on GPT-4, the state-of-the-art LLM, our analyses suggest that LLM agents appear to exhibit a range of human-like social behaviors such as distributional and reciprocity preferences, responsiveness to group identity cues, engagement in indirect reciprocity, and social learning capabilities. However, our analysis also reveals notable differences: LLMs demonstrate a pronounced fairness preference, weaker positive reciprocity, and a more calculating approach in social learning compared to humans. These insights indicate that while LLMs hold great promise for applications in social science research, such as in laboratory experiments and agent-based modeling, the subtle behavioral differences between LLM agents and humans warrant further investigation. Careful examination and development of protocols in evaluating the social behaviors of LLMs are necessary before directly applying these models to emulate human behavior. ",

However, their effectiveness depends on the quality of the pre-training dataset, particularly the human reference comments, which serve as a bridge between the programming language and natural language. One significant challenge is that such comments can become inconsistent with the corresponding code as the software evolves. This discrepancy can lead to suboptimal training of the models, decreasing their performances. LLMs have demonstrated superior capabilities in generating high-quality code comments. In light of that, we try to tackle the quality issue of the dataset by harnessing the power of LLMs. Specifically, we raise the question: Can we rebuild the pre-training dataset by substituting the original comments with LLM-generated ones for more effective pre-trained code models? To answer the question, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation to compare ChatGPT-generated comments with human reference comments. As existing reference-based metrics treat the reference comments as gold standards, we introduce two auxiliary tasks as novel reference-free metrics to assess the quality of comments, i.e., code-comment inconsistency detection and code search. Experimental results show that ChatGPT-generated comments demonstrate superior semantic consistency with the code compared to human references, indicating the potential of utilizing ChatGPT to enhance the quality of the pre-training dataset. We rebuilt the widely used dataset, CodeSearchNet, with ChatGPT-generated comments. Subsequent experiments involve re-pre-training the CodeT5 with our refined dataset.Evaluation results on four generation tasks and one understanding code intelligence tasks show that the model pre-trained by ChatGPT-enhanced data outperforms its counterpart on code summarization, code generation, and code translation tasks.

A set of rewards measuring the localization accuracy, the accuracy of predicted labels, and the scale consistency among nearby patches are designed in the agent to guide the scale optimization. The proposed scale-consistency reward ensures similar scales for neighboring objects of the same category. Furthermore, a spatial-semantic attention mechanism is designed to exploit the spatial semantic relations between patches. The agent employs the proximal policy optimization strategy in conjunction with the evolutionary strategy, effectively utilizing both the current patch status and historical experience embedded in the agent.

Performing search in adversarial games with imperfect information is notoriously difficult and often requires a complicated training process. We present an algorithm that uses an arbitrary policy-gradient algorithm that learns from sampled trajectories in the setting of fully adversarial two-player games with imperfect information. Alongside the training of the policy network, the algorithm trains an additional critic network, which provides multiple expected values if both players follow one of a fixed set of transformations of the policy given by the policy network. These values are then used for depth-limited search. We show how the values from this critic can create a value function for imperfect information games. Moreover, they can be used to compute the summary statistics necessary to start the search from an arbitrary decision point in the game. The presented algorithm is scalable to very large games since it does not require any search in the training time. Furthermore, given sufficient computational resources, our algorithm may choose whether to use search or play the strategy according to the trained policy network anywhere in the game. We evaluate the algorithm's performance when trained alongside Regularized Nash Dynamics, and we compare the performance of using the search against the policy network in the standard benchmark game of Leduc hold'em, multiple variants of imperfect information Goofspiel, and in a game of Battleships.

    "abstract": "Fake news detection models are critical to countering disinformation but can be manipulated through adversarial attacks. In this position paper, we analyze how an attacker can compromise the performance of an online learning detector on specific news content without being able to manipulate the original target news. In some contexts, such as social networks, where the attacker cannot exert complete control over all the information, this scenario can indeed be quite plausible. Therefore, we show how an attacker could potentially introduce poisoning data into the training data to manipulate the behavior of an online learning method. Our initial findings reveal varying susceptibility of logistic regression models based on complexity and attack type. ",

    "abstract": "Private computation of nonlinear functions, such as Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) and max-pooling operations, in deep neural networks (DNNs) poses significant challenges in terms of storage, bandwidth, and time consumption. To address these challenges, there has been a growing interest in utilizing privacy-preserving techniques that leverage polynomial activation functions and kernelized convolutions as alternatives to traditional ReLUs. However, these alternative approaches often suffer from a trade-off between achieving faster private inference (PI) and sacrificing model accuracy. In particular, when applied to much deeper networks, these methods encounter training instabilities, leading to issues like exploding gradients (resulting in NaNs) or suboptimal approximations. In this study, we focus on PolyKervNets, a technique known for offering improved dynamic approximations in smaller networks but still facing instabilities in larger and more complex networks. Our primary objective is to empirically explore optimization-based training recipes to enhance the performance of PolyKervNets in larger networks. By doing so, we aim to potentially eliminate the need for traditional nonlinear activation functions, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in privacy-preserving deep neural network architectures.

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNs) are prominent approaches to node classification tasks on heterogeneous graphs. Despite the superior performance, insights about the predictions made from HGNs are obscure to humans. Existing explainability techniques are mainly proposed for GNNs on homogeneous graphs. They focus on highlighting salient graph objects to the predictions whereas the problem of how these objects affect the predictions remains unsolved. Given heterogeneous graphs with complex structures and rich semantics, it is imperative that salient objects can be accompanied with their influence paths to the predictions, unveiling the reasoning process of HGNs. In this paper, we develop xPath, a new framework that provides fine-grained explanations for black-box HGNs specifying a cause node with its influence path to the target node. In xPath, we differentiate the influence of a node on the prediction w.r.t. every individual influence path, and measure the influence by perturbing graph structure via a novel graph rewiring algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a greedy search algorithm to find the most influential fine-grained explanations efficiently. Empirical results on various HGNs and heterogeneous graphs show that xPath yields faithful explanations efficiently, outperforming the adaptations of advanced GNN explanation approaches. ",

Neural surface reconstruction approaches can recover complex 3D geometry that are difficult for classical Multi-view Stereo (MVS) approaches, such as non-Lambertian surfaces and thin structures.

In this paper, we present NoPose-NeuS, a neural implicit surface reconstruction method that extends NeuS to jointly optimize camera poses with the geometry and color networks. We encode the camera poses as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and introduce two additional losses, which are multi-view feature consistency and rendered depth losses, to constrain the learned geometry for better estimated camera poses and scene surfaces. Extensive experiments on the DTU dataset show that the proposed method can estimate relatively accurate camera poses, while maintaining a high surface reconstruction quality with 0.89 mean Chamfer distance.

Then, the different results from the simplified E-model and subjective MOS prediction model were used to create the Bias function, before adding to the simplified E-model. Finally, it has been found that the outputs from the enhanced simplified E-model for the G.729 codec shows better accuracy when compared to the original simplified E-model, specially, after the enhanced model has been evaluated with 4 test sets. The major contribution of this enhancement is that errors are reduced by 58.87 % when compared to the generic simplified E-model.

Existing methods either compromise on rendering quality or are excessively computationally intensive, often demanding dozens of hours to perform, which significantly hinders their practical application. In this paper, we introduce Fast Orthogonal Plane (Forplane), a novel, efficient framework based on neural radiance fields (NeRF) for the reconstruction of deformable tissues. We conceptualize surgical procedures as 4D volumes, and break them down into static and dynamic fields comprised of orthogonal neural planes. This factorization iscretizes the four-dimensional space, leading to a decreased memory usage and faster optimization. A spatiotemporal importance sampling scheme is introduced to improve performance in regions with tool occlusion as well as large motions and accelerate training. An efficient ray marching method is applied to skip sampling among empty regions, significantly improving inference speed. Forplane accommodates both binocular and monocular endoscopy videos, demonstrating its extensive applicability and flexibility. Our experiments, carried out on two in vivo datasets, the EndoNeRF and Hamlyn datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. In all cases, Forplane substantially accelerates both the optimization process (by over 100 times) and the inference process (by over 15 times) while maintaining or even improving the quality across a variety of non-rigid deformations. This significant performance improvement promises to be a valuable asset for future intraoperative surgical applications.

    "abstract": "Depth completion, aiming to predict dense depth maps from sparse depth measurements, plays a crucial role in many computer vision related applications. Deep learning approaches have demonstrated overwhelming success in this task. However, high-precision depth completion without relying on the ground-truth data, which are usually costly, still remains challenging. The reason lies on the ignorance of 3D structural information in most previous unsupervised solutions, causing inaccurate spatial propagation and mixed-depth problems. To alleviate the above challenges, this paper explores the utilization of 3D perceptual features and multi-view geometry consistency to devise a high-precision self-supervised depth completion method. Firstly, a 3D perceptual spatial propagation algorithm is constructed with a point cloud representation and an attention weighting mechanism to capture more reasonable and favorable neighboring features during the iterative depth propagation process. Secondly, the multi-view geometric constraints between adjacent views are explicitly incorporated to guide the optimization of the whole depth completion model in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets of NYU-Depthv2 and VOID demonstrate that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art depth completion performance compared with other unsupervised methods, and competitive performance compared with previous supervised methods.

In this study, we construct the largest preprocessed unlabeled TOF-MRA datasets (1510 subjects) to date. We also provide three additional labeled datasets totaling 113 subjects.

By employing this approach, we maximize the knowledge gained from the unlabeled data. The pretrained model is evaluated on four cerebrovascular segmentation datasets. The results have demonstrated the superior performance of our model, with an improvement of approximately 3\\% compared to state-of-the-art semi- and self-supervised methods.

    "abstract": "There has been significant progress made in the field of autonomous vehicles. Object detection and tracking are the primary tasks for any autonomous vehicle. The task of object detection in autonomous vehicles relies on a variety of sensors like cameras, and LiDAR. Although image features are typically preferred, numerous approaches take spatial data as input. Exploiting this information we present an approach wherein, using a novel encoding of the LiDAR point cloud we infer the location of different classes near the autonomous vehicles. This approach does not implement a bird's eye view approach, which is generally applied for this application and thus saves the extensive pre-processing required. After studying the numerous networks and approaches used to solve this approach, we have implemented a novel model with the intention to inculcate their advantages and avoid their shortcomings. The output is predictions about the location and orientation of objects in the scene in form of 3D bounding boxes and labels of scene objects. ",

Some of these laws -- notably the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) -- have been the focus of large bodies of research by the computer science community, while others have received less attention. In this work, we analyze a set of Internet privacy and data protection regulations drawn from around the world -- both those that have frequently been studied by computer scientists and those that have not -- and develop a taxonomy of rights granted and obligations imposed by these laws. We then leverage this taxonomy to systematize 270 technical research papers published in computer science venues that investigate the impact of these laws and explore how technical solutions can complement legal protections. Finally, we analyze the results in this space through an interdisciplinary lens and make recommendations for future work at the intersection of computer science and legal privacy. ",

    "abstract": "The security of smart contracts, which are an important part of blockchain technology, has attracted much attention. In particular, reentrancy vulnerability, which is hidden and complex, poses a great threat to smart contracts. In order to improve the existing detection methods, which exhibit low efficiency and accuracy, in this paper, we propose a smart contract threat detection technology based on symbolic execution. In this method, first, the recursive descent algorithm is used to recover the basic blocks of contract code and control flow diagram, and static type inference is performed for static single assignment (SSA) variables. Then, the control flow diagram is encoded into constrained horn clause (CHC) constraints in combination with the symbolic execution technology. Model checking is conducted for the generated constraints using an automatic theorem prover based on the abstraction refinement technique for fast static detection of common security threats in smart contracts. Compared with existing detection methods, the method proposed in this paper allows the detection of both the checks-effects-interactions pattern and the vulnerability in relation to reentrant locks. It can simulate the state changes of reentrant locks as well as other global variables in multiple recursive transactions. The experimental results show that this method significantly increases both detection efficiency and accuracy, improving the security of smart contracts. ",

    "abstract": "User attribute prediction is a crucial task in various industries. However, sharing user data across different organizations faces challenges due to privacy concerns and legal requirements regarding personally identifiable information. Regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the Personal Information Protection Law of the People's Republic of China impose restrictions on data sharing. To address the need for utilizing features from multiple clients while adhering to legal requirements, federated learning algorithms have been proposed. These algorithms aim to predict user attributes without directly sharing the data. However, existing approaches typically rely on matching users across companies, which can result in dishonest partners discovering user lists or the inability to utilize all available features. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for predicting user attributes without requiring user matching. Our approach involves training deep matrix factorization models on different clients and sharing only the item vectors. This allows us to predict user attributes without sharing the user vectors themselves. The algorithm is evaluated using the publicly available MovieLens dataset and demonstrate that it achieves similar performance to the FedAvg algorithm, reaching 96% of a single model's accuracy. The proposed algorithm is particularly well-suited for improving customer targeting and enhancing the overall customer experience. This paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of user attribute prediction by offering a novel algorithm that addresses some of the most pressing privacy concerns in this area. ",

While a few previous studies have attempted to leverage semi-automatic methods for cost-effective bounding box annotation, such methods have limitations in efficiently handling numerous multi-class objects. To effectively accelerate 3D annotation pipelines, we propose iDet3D, an efficient interactive 3D object detector. Supporting a user-friendly 2D interface, which can ease the cognitive burden of exploring 3D space to provide click interactions, iDet3D enables users to annotate the entire objects in each scene with minimal interactions. Taking the sparse nature of 3D point clouds into account, we design a negative click simulation (NCS) to improve accuracy by reducing false-positive predictions. In addition, iDet3D incorporates two click propagation techniques to take full advantage of user interactions: (1) dense click guidance (DCG) for keeping user-provided information throughout the network and (2) spatial click propagation (SCP) for detecting other instances of the same class based on the user-specified objects. Through our extensive experiments, we present that our method can construct precise annotations in a few clicks, which shows the practicality as an efficient annotation tool for 3D object detection.

    "abstract": "Search engines are crucial as they provide an efficient and easy way to access vast amounts of information on the internet for diverse information needs. User queries, even with a specific need, can differ significantly. Prior research has explored the resilience of ranking models against typical query variations like paraphrasing, misspellings, and order changes. Yet, these works overlook how diverse demographics uniquely formulate identical queries. For instance, older individuals tend to construct queries more naturally and in varied order compared to other groups. This demographic diversity necessitates enhancing the adaptability of ranking models to diverse query formulations. To this end, in this paper, we propose a framework that integrates a novel rewriting pipeline that rewrites queries from various demographic perspectives and a novel framework to enhance ranking robustness. To be specific, we use Chain of Thought (CoT) technology to utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents to emulate various demographic profiles, then use them for efficient query rewriting, and we innovate a robust Multi-gate Mixture of Experts (MMoE) architecture coupled with a hybrid loss function, collectively strengthening the ranking models' robustness. Our extensive experimentation on both public and industrial datasets assesses the efficacy of our query rewriting approach and the enhanced accuracy and robustness of the ranking model. The findings highlight the sophistication and effectiveness of our proposed model. ",

    "abstract": "Several code summarization techniques have been proposed in the literature to automatically document a code snippet or a function. Ideally, software developers should be involved in assessing the quality of the generated summaries. However, in most cases, researchers rely on automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR. These metrics are all based on the same assumption: The higher the textual similarity between the generated summary and a reference summary written by developers, the higher its quality. However, there are two reasons for which this assumption falls short: (i) reference summaries, e.g., code comments collected by mining software repositories, may be of low quality or even outdated; (ii) generated summaries, while using a different wording than a reference one, could be semantically equivalent to it, thus still being suitable to document the code snippet. In this paper, we perform a thorough empirical investigation on the complementarity of different types of metrics in capturing the quality of a generated summary. Also, we propose to address the limitations of existing metrics by considering a new dimension, capturing the extent to which the generated summary aligns with the semantics of the documented code snippet, independently from the reference summary. To this end, we present a new metric based on contrastive learning to capture said aspect. We empirically show that the inclusion of this novel dimension enables a more effective representation of developers' evaluations regarding the quality of automatically generated summaries. ",

Multi-energy systems are increasingly seen as a key component of future energy systems, and a valuable source of flexibility, which can significantly contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable whole energy system. Therefore, there is a stringent need for developing novel and performant models for forecasting multi-energy demand of integrated energy systems, which to account for the different types of interacting energy vectors and of the coupling between them. Previous efforts in demand forecasting focused mainly on the single electrical power consumption or, more recently, on the single heat or gas power consumptions. In order to address this gap, in this paper six novel prediction models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are developed, for either individual or joint prediction of multi-energy power consumptions: the single input/single output CNN model with determining the optimum number of epochs (CNN_1), the multiple input/single output CNN model (CNN_2), the single input/ single output CNN model with training/validation/testing datasets (CNN_3), the joint prediction CNN model (CNN_4), the multiple-building input/output CNN model (CNN_5) and the federated learning CNN model (CNN_6). All six novel CNN models are applied in a comprehensive manner on a novel integrated electrical, heat and gas network system, which only recently has started to be used for forecasting. The forecast horizon is short-term (next half an hour) and all the predictions results are evaluated in terms of the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE), while the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is used for comparison purposes with other existent results from literature.

Using a causal inference framework, we empirically and theoretically analyze the challenges of conducting LLM-simulated experiments, and explore potential solutions. In the context of demand estimation, we show that variations in the treatment included in the prompt (e.g., price of focal product) can cause variations in unspecified confounding factors (e.g., price of competitors, historical prices, outside temperature), introducing endogeneity and yielding implausibly flat demand curves. We propose a theoretical framework suggesting this endogeneity issue generalizes to other contexts and won't be fully resolved by merely improving the training data. Unlike real experiments where researchers assign pre-existing units across conditions, LLMs simulate units based on the entire prompt, which includes the description of the treatment. Therefore, due to associations in the training data, the characteristics of individuals and environments simulated by the LLM can be affected by the treatment assignment. We explore two potential solutions. The first specifies all contextual variables that affect both treatment and outcome, which we demonstrate to be challenging for a general-purpose LLM. The second explicitly specifies the source of treatment variation in the prompt given to the LLM (e.g., by informing the LLM that the store is running an experiment). While this approach only allows the estimation of a conditional average treatment effect that depends on the specific experimental design, it provides valuable directional results for exploratory analysis.

Multimodal neural architecture search (MNAS) is a more efficient approach. However, current MNAS methods, while effective in integrating multi-level information, are incapable of simultaneously searching for optimal operations to extract modality-specific information. This weakens the robustness of the model in addressing diverse scenarios. Moreover, these methods also fall short in enhancing the capture of emotional cues. In this paper, we propose robust-sentiment multimodal neural architecture search (RMNAS) framework. Specifically, we utilize the Transformer as a unified architecture for various modalities and incorporate a search for token mixers to enhance the encoding capacity of individual modalities and improve robustness across diverse scenarios. Subsequently, we leverage BM-NAS to integrate multi-level information. Furthermore, we incorporate local sentiment variation trends to guide the token mixers computation, enhancing the model's ability to capture sentiment context. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms or competitively matches existing state-of-the-art approaches in incomplete multimodal learning, both in sentence-level and dialogue-level MSA tasks, without the need for knowledge of incomplete learning.

Malicious attackers can infer more sensitive information in the database using well-designed combinatorial queries, such as by comparing the answer sets of where Turing Award winners born before 1950 and after 1940 lived, the living places of Turing Award winner Hinton are probably exposed, although the living places may have been deleted in the training due to the privacy concerns. In this work, inspired by the privacy protection in graph embeddings, we propose a privacy-preserving neural graph database (P-NGDB) to alleviate the risks of privacy leakage in NGDBs. We introduce adversarial training techniques in the training stage to force the NGDBs to generate indistinguishable answers when queried with private information, enhancing the difficulty of inferring sensitive information through combinations of multiple innocuous queries. Extensive experiment results on three datasets show that P-NGDB can effectively protect private information in the graph database while delivering high-quality public answers responses to queries. ",

    "abstract": "One persistent challenge in deep learning based speech emotion recognition (SER) is the unconscious encoding of emotion-irrelevant factors (e.g., speaker or phonetic variability), which limits the generalization of SER in practical use. In this paper, we propose DSNet, a Disentangled Siamese Network with neutral calibration, to meet the demand for a more robust and explainable SER model. Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal feature disentanglement module to explicitly project the high-level representation into two distinct subspaces. Later, we propose a novel neutral calibration mechanism to encourage one subspace to capture sufficient emotion-irrelevant information. In this way, the other one can better isolate and emphasize the emotion-relevant information within speech signals. Experimental results on two popular benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DSNet over various state-of-the-art methods for speaker-independent SER. ",

    "abstract": "Protection domains are one of the most enduring concepts in Access Control. Entities with identical access control characteristics are grouped under the same protection domain, and domain-based policies assign access privileges to the protection domain as a whole. With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), devices play the roles of both subjects and objects. Domain-based policies are particularly suited to support this symmetry of roles. This paper studies the mining of domain-based policies from incomplete access logs. We began by building a theory of domain-based policies, resulting in a polynomial-time algorithm that constructs the optimal domain-based policy out of a given access control matrix. We then showed that the problem of domain-based policy mining (DBPM) and the related problem of mining policies for domain and type enforcement (DTEPM) are both NP-complete. Next, we looked at the practical problem of using a MaxSAT solver to solve DBPM. We devised sophisticated encodings for this purpose, and empirically evaluated their relative performance. This paper thus lays the groundwork for future study of DBPM. ",

    "abstract": "Learning-outcome prediction (LOP) is a long-standing and critical problem in educational routes. Many studies have contributed to developing effective models while often suffering from data shortage and low generalization to various institutions due to the privacy-protection issue. To this end, this study proposes a distributed grade prediction model, dubbed FecMap, by exploiting the federated learning (FL) framework that preserves the private data of local clients and communicates with others through a global generalized model. FecMap considers local subspace learning (LSL), which explicitly learns the local features against the global features, and multi-layer privacy protection (MPP), which hierarchically protects the private features, including model-shareable features and not-allowably shared features, to achieve client-specific classifiers of high performance on LOP per institution. FecMap is then achieved in an iteration manner with all datasets distributed on clients by training a local neural network composed of a global part, a local part, and a classification head in clients and averaging the global parts from clients on the server. To evaluate the FecMap model, we collected three higher-educational datasets of student academic records from engineering majors. Experiment results manifest that FecMap benefits from the proposed LSL and MPP and achieves steady performance on the task of LOP, compared with the state-of-the-art models. This study makes a fresh attempt at the use of federated learning in the learning-analytical task, potentially paving the way to facilitating personalized education with privacy protection. ",

Generally, training a commercially viable neural network requires significant amounts of data and computing resources, and it is easy for unauthorized users to use the networks illegally. Therefore, network ownership verification has become one of the most crucial steps in safeguarding digital assets. To verify the ownership of networks, the existing network fingerprinting approaches perform poorly in the aspects of efficiency, stealthiness, and discriminability. To address these issues, we propose a network fingerprinting approach, named as GanFinger, to construct the network fingerprints based on the network behavior, which is characterized by network outputs of pairs of original examples and conferrable adversarial examples. Specifically, GanFinger leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively generate conferrable adversarial examples with imperceptible perturbations. These examples can exhibit identical outputs on copyrighted and pirated networks while producing different results on irrelevant networks. Moreover, to enhance the accuracy of fingerprint ownership verification, the network similarity is computed based on the accuracy-robustness distance of fingerprint examples'outputs. To evaluate the performance of GanFinger, we construct a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 186 networks with five network structures and four popular network post-processing techniques. The benchmark experiments demonstrate that GanFinger significantly outperforms the state-of-the-arts in efficiency, stealthiness, and discriminability. It achieves a remarkable 6.57 times faster in fingerprint generation and boosts the ARUC value by 0.175, resulting in a relative improvement of about 26%. ",

Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is crucial in machine learning applications, specifically in node classification and link prediction tasks. KGE remains a vital research topic within the semantic web community. RDF-star introduces the concept of a quoted triple (QT), a specific form of triple employed either as the subject or object within another triple. Moreover, RDF-star permits a QT to act as compositional entities within another QT, thereby enabling the representation of recursive, hyper-relational KGs with nested structures. However, existing KGE models fail to adequately learn the semantics of QTs and entities, primarily because they do not account for RDF-star graphs containing multi-leveled nested QTs and QT-QT relationships. This study introduces RDF-star2Vec, a novel KGE model specifically designed for RDF-star graphs. RDF-star2Vec introduces graph walk techniques that enable probabilistic transitions between a QT and its compositional entities. Feature vectors for QTs, entities, and relations are derived from generated sequences through the structured skip-gram model. Additionally, we provide a dataset and a benchmarking framework for data mining tasks focused on complex RDF-star graphs. Evaluative experiments demonstrated that RDF-star2Vec yielded superior performance compared to recent extensions of RDF2Vec in various tasks including classification, clustering, entity relatedness, and QT similarity.

However, the abductive logical reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) is underexplored in KG literature. In this paper, we initially and formally raise the task of abductive logical reasoning over KGs, which involves inferring the most probable logic hypothesis from the KGs to explain an observed entity set. Traditional approaches use symbolic methods, like searching, to tackle the knowledge graph problem. However, the symbolic methods are unsuitable for this task, because the KGs are naturally incomplete, and the logical hypotheses can be complex with multiple variables and relations. To address these issues, we propose a generative approach to create logical expressions based on observations. First, we sample hypothesis-observation pairs from the KG and use supervised training to train a generative model that generates hypotheses from observations. Since supervised learning only minimizes structural differences between generated and reference hypotheses, higher structural similarity does not guarantee a better explanation for observations. To tackle this issue, we introduce the Reinforcement Learning from the Knowledge Graph (RLF-KG) method, which minimizes the differences between observations and conclusions drawn from the generated hypotheses according to the KG. Experimental results demonstrate that transformer-based generative models can generate logical explanations robustly and efficiently. Moreover, with the assistance of RLF-KG, the generated hypothesis can provide better explanations for the observations, and the method of supervised learning with RLF-KG achieves state-of-the-art results on abductive knowledge graph reasoning on three widely used KGs.

Recently, researchers have attempted to leverage the success of self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) in Computer Vision(CV) and Natural Language Processing(NLP) to tackle time series representation. Nevertheless, due to the special temporal characteristics, relying solely on empirical guidance from other domains may be ineffective for time series and difficult to adapt to multiple downstream tasks. To this end, we review three parts involved in SSCL including 1) designing augmentation methods for positive pairs, 2) constructing (hard) negative pairs, and 3) designing SSCL loss. For 1) and 2), we find that unsuitable positive and negative pair construction may introduce inappropriate inductive biases, which neither preserve temporal properties nor provide sufficient discriminative features. For 3), just exploring segment- or instance-level semantics information is not enough for learning universal representation. To remedy the above issues, we propose a novel self-supervised framework named TimesURL. Specifically, we first introduce a frequency-temporal-based augmentation to keep the temporal property unchanged. And then, we construct double Universums as a special kind of hard negative to guide better contrastive learning. Additionally, we introduce time reconstruction as a joint optimization objective with contrastive learning to capture both segment-level and instance-level information. As a result, TimesURL can learn high-quality universal representations and achieve state-of-the-art performance in 6 different downstream tasks, including short- and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, anomaly detection and transfer learning.

If we do path tracing and use a high dynamic range lighting environment, the rendering becomes computationally heavy. We propose a compact and efficient neural method for representing and rendering the appearance of heterogeneous translucent objects. The neural representation function resembles a bidirectional scattering-surface reflectance distribution function (BSSRDF). However, conventional BSSRDF models assume a planar half-space medium and only surface variation of the material, which is often not a good representation of the appearance of real-world objects. Our method represents the BSSRDF of a full object taking its geometry and heterogeneities into account. This is similar to a neural radiance field, but our representation works for an arbitrary distant lighting environment. In a sense, we present a version of neural precomputed radiance transfer that captures all-frequency relighting of heterogeneous translucent objects. We use a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with skip connections to represent the appearance of an object as a function of spatial position, direction of observation, and direction of incidence. The latter is considered a directional light incident across the entire non-self-shadowed part of the object. We demonstrate the ability of our method to store highly complex materials while having high accuracy when comparing to reference images of the represented object in unseen lighting environments. As compared with path tracing of a heterogeneous light scattering volume behind a refractive interface, our method more easily enables importance sampling of the directions of incidence and can be integrated into existing rendering frameworks while achieving interactive frame rates.

To address the problem, in this work, we introduce the \"Spatial-temporal Induced Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning\" (STI-HRL) framework, for capturing the interplay between spatial and temporal factors in human mobility decision-making. Specifically, STI-HRL employs a two-tiered decision-making process: the low-level focuses on disentangling spatial and temporal preferences using dedicated agents, while the high-level integrates these considerations to finalize the decision. To complement the hierarchical decision setting, we construct a hypergraph to organize historical data, encapsulating the multi-aspect semantics of human mobility. We propose a cross-channel hypergraph embedding module to learn the representations as the states to facilitate the decision-making cycle. Our extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate the superiority of STI-HRL over state-of-the-art methods in predicting users' next visits across various performance metrics. ",

Mainstream methods are trained with independent pairs of a video and a caption from its ground-truth set without exploiting the intra-set relationship, resulting in low diversity of generated captions. Different from them, we formulate diverse captioning into a semantic-concept-guided set prediction (SCG-SP) problem by fitting the predicted caption set to the ground-truth set, where the set-level relationship is fully captured. Specifically, our set prediction consists of two synergistic tasks, i.e., caption generation and an auxiliary task of concept combination prediction providing extra semantic supervision. Each caption in the set is attached to a concept combination indicating the primary semantic content of the caption and facilitating element alignment in set prediction. Furthermore, we apply a diversity regularization term on concepts to encourage the model to generate semantically diverse captions with various concept combinations. These two tasks share multiple semantics-specific encodings as input, which are obtained by iterative interaction between visual features and conceptual queries. The correspondence between the generated captions and specific concept combinations further guarantees the interpretability of our model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed SCG-SP achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under both relevance and diversity metrics. ",

To address these two challenges, this paper firstly proposes simple but effective triple optimization strategies (TriOpts) to accelerate the training process and improve the model performance of DNNs in wind power forecasting. Then, permutation feature importance (PFI) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) techniques are innovatively presented to interpret forecasted behaviors of DNNs, from global and instance perspectives. Simulation results show that the proposed TriOpts not only drastically improve the model generalization of DNNs for both the deterministic and probabilistic wind power forecasting, but also accelerate the training process. Besides, the proposed PFI and LIME techniques can accurately estimate the contribution of each feature to wind power forecasting, which helps to construct feature engineering and understand how to obtain forecasted values for a given sample.

    "title": "DI-V2X: Learning Domain-Invariant Representation for  Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaborative 3D Object Detection",
    "abstract": "Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception has recently gained significant attention due to its capability to enhance scene understanding by integrating information from various agents, e.g., vehicles, and infrastructure. However, current works often treat the information from each agent equally, ignoring the inherent domain gap caused by the utilization of different LiDAR sensors of each agent, thus leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose DI-V2X, that aims to learn Domain-Invariant representations through a new distillation framework to mitigate the domain discrepancy in the context of V2X 3D object detection. DI-V2X comprises three essential components: a domain-mixing instance augmentation (DMA) module, a progressive domain-invariant distillation (PDD) module, and a domain-adaptive fusion (DAF) module. Specifically, DMA builds a domain-mixing 3D instance bank for the teacher and student models during training, resulting in aligned data representation. Next, PDD encourages the student models from different domains to gradually learn a domain-invariant feature representation towards the teacher, where the overlapping regions between agents are employed as guidance to facilitate the distillation process. Furthermore, DAF closes the domain gap between the students by incorporating calibration-aware domain-adaptive attention. Extensive experiments on the challenging DAIR-V2X and V2XSet benchmark datasets demonstrate DI-V2X achieves remarkable performance, outperforming all the previous V2X models.

    "abstract": "The Wasserstein barycenter problem is to compute the average of $m$ given probability measures, which has been widely studied in many different areas; however, real-world data sets are often noisy and huge, which impedes its applications in practice. Hence, in this paper, we focus on improving the computational efficiency of two types of robust Wasserstein barycenter problem (RWB): fixed-support RWB (fixed-RWB) and free-support RWB (free-RWB); actually, the former is a subroutine of the latter. Firstly, we improve efficiency through model reducing; we reduce RWB as an augmented Wasserstein barycenter problem, which works for both fixed-RWB and free-RWB. Especially, fixed-RWB can be computed within $\\widetilde{O}(\\frac{mn^2}{\\epsilon_+})$ time by using an off-the-shelf solver, where $\\epsilon_+$ is the pre-specified additive error and $n$ is the size of locations of input measures. Then, for free-RWB, we leverage a quality guaranteed data compression technique, coreset, to accelerate computation by reducing the data set size $m$. It shows that running algorithms on the coreset is enough instead of on the original data set. Next, by combining the model reducing and coreset techniques above, we propose an algorithm for free-RWB by updating the weights and locations alternatively. Finally, our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our techniques. ",

To tackle these problems, we provide deep unrolled architectures with a stochastic descent nature by imposing descending constraints during training. The descending constraints are forced layer by layer to ensure that each unrolled layer takes, on average, a descent step toward the optimum during training. We theoretically prove that the sequence constructed by the outputs of the unrolled layers is then guaranteed to converge for unseen problems, assuming no distribution shift between training and test problems. We also show that standard unrolling is brittle to perturbations, and our imposed constraints provide the unrolled networks with robustness to additive noise and perturbations. We numerically assess unrolled architectures trained under the proposed constraints in two different applications, including the sparse coding using learnable iterative shrinkage and thresholding algorithm (LISTA) and image inpainting using proximal generative flow (GLOW-Prox), and demonstrate the performance and robustness benefits of the proposed method.

Considering the uncertainty in dynamic SATIN systems, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem to minimize the time-average expected service delay by jointly optimizing resource allocation and task offloading while satisfying the energy constraints.

We first convert TKGs into a temporal event knowledge graph (TEKG) which has a more explicit representation of time in term of nodes of the graph. The TEKG equips us to develop a differentiable random walk approach to time prediction. Finally, we introduce conditional probability density functions, associated with the logical rules involving the query interval, using which we arrive at the time prediction. We compare TEILP with state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets. We show that our model achieves a significant improvement over baselines while providing interpretable explanations. In particular, we consider several scenarios where training samples are limited, event types are imbalanced, and forecasting the time of future events based on only past events is desired. In all these cases, TEILP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness. ",

While the incorporation of visual information holds the promise of enhancing recommendation accuracy and alleviating the cold-start problem, it is essential to point out that the inclusion of item images may introduce substantial security challenges. Some existing works have shown that the item provider can manipulate item exposure rates to its advantage by constructing adversarial images. However, these works cannot reveal the real vulnerability of visually-aware recommender systems because (1) The generated adversarial images are markedly distorted, rendering them easily detectable by human observers; (2) The effectiveness of the attacks is inconsistent and even ineffective in some scenarios. To shed light on the real vulnerabilities of visually-aware recommender systems when confronted with adversarial images, this paper introduces a novel attack method, IPDGI (Item Promotion by Diffusion Generated Image). Specifically, IPDGI employs a guided diffusion model to generate adversarial samples designed to deceive visually-aware recommender systems. Taking advantage of accurately modeling benign images' distribution by diffusion models, the generated adversarial images have high fidelity with original images, ensuring the stealth of our IPDGI. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments on two commonly used e-commerce recommendation datasets (Amazon Beauty and Amazon Baby) with several typical visually-aware recommender systems. The experimental results show that our attack method has a significant improvement in both the performance of promoting the long-tailed (i.e., unpopular) items and the quality of generated adversarial images.

In this paper, we propose a unified framework, Modality-Collaborative Transformer with Hybrid Feature Reconstruction (MCT-HFR), to address these issues. The crucial component of MCT is a novel attention-based encoder which concurrently extracts and dynamically balances the intra- and inter-modality relations for all associated modalities. With additional modality-wise parameter sharing, a more compact representation can be encoded with less time and space complexity. To improve the robustness of MCT, we further introduce HFR which consists of two modules: Local Feature Imagination (LFI) and Global Feature Alignment (GFA). During model training, LFI leverages complete features as supervisory signals to recover local missing features, while GFA is designed to reduce the global semantic gap between pairwise complete and incomplete representations. Experimental evaluations on two popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms advanced baselines in both complete and incomplete data scenarios. ",

Based on a simple combination strategy and performance-driven synergy criteria, we designed the Multi-Encoder Transformer, which consists of up to five diverse encoders. Results showcased that our approach can improve the quality of the translation across a variety of languages and dataset sizes and it is particularly effective in low-resource languages where we observed a maximum increase of 7.16 BLEU compared to the single-encoder model.

Especially in scenarios that require long logical chains or complex reasoning, the hallucination and knowledge limitation of LLM limit its performance in question answering (QA). In this paper, we propose a novel framework KnowledgeNavigator to address these challenges by efficiently and accurately retrieving external knowledge from knowledge graph and using it as a key factor to enhance LLM reasoning. Specifically, KnowledgeNavigator first mines and enhances the potential constraints of the given question to guide the reasoning. Then it retrieves and filters external knowledge that supports answering through iterative reasoning on knowledge graph with the guidance of LLM and the question. Finally, KnowledgeNavigator constructs the structured knowledge into effective prompts that are friendly to LLM to help its reasoning. We evaluate KnowledgeNavigator on multiple public KGQA benchmarks, the experiments show the framework has great effectiveness and generalization, outperforming previous knowledge graph enhanced LLM methods and is comparable to the fully supervised models.

The motion prediction of pedestrians and vehicles helps emergency braking, reduces collisions, and improves traffic safety. Current trajectory prediction research faces problems of complex social interactions, high dynamics and multi-modality. Especially, it still has limitations in long-time prediction. We propose Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for multi-modal trajectory prediction. We combine Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformer Networks by generating stable resolution pseudo-images from Spatio-temporal graphs through a designed stacking and interception method. Furthermore, we design the attention-aware module to handle social interaction information in scenarios involving mixed pedestrian-vehicle traffic. Thus, we maintain the advantages of the Graph and Transformer, i.e., the ability to aggregate information over an arbitrary number of neighbors and the ability to perform complex time-dependent data processing. We conduct experiments on datasets involving pedestrian, vehicle, and mixed trajectories, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our model minimizes displacement errors across various metrics and significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions. It is worth noting that our model effectively reduces the final displacement error, illustrating the ability of our model to predict for a long time. ",

Extracting information from raw data at the source by using edge computing is a promising solution to this problem, with integrated intention decoders providing the best compression ratio. In this work, we compare different neural networks (NN) for motor decoding in terms of accuracy and implementation cost. We further show that combining traditional signal processing techniques with machine learning ones deliver surprisingly good performance even with simple NNs. Adding a block Bidirectional Bessel filter provided maximum gains of $\\approx 0.05$, $0.04$ and $0.03$ in $R^2$ for ANN\\_3d, SNN\\_3D and ANN models, while the gains were lower ($\\approx 0.02$ or less) for LSTM and SNN\\_streaming models.

However, it encounters two critical issues: 1) The number of prompts grows exponentially as the number of modalities increases; and 2) It lacks robustness in scenarios with different missing modality settings between training and inference. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective prompt design to address these challenges. Instead of using missing-aware prompts, we utilize prompts as modality-specific tokens, enabling them to capture the unique characteristics of each modality. Furthermore, our prompt design leverages orthogonality between prompts as a key element to learn distinct information across different modalities and promote diversity in the learned representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our prompt design enhances both performance and robustness while reducing the number of prompts. ",

However, discrepancies exist among datasets due to external factors and data acquisition strategies. External factors include geographical differences and driving styles, while data acquisition strategies include data acquisition rate, history/prediction length, and detector/tracker error. Consequently, the proficient performance of models trained on large-scale datasets has limited transferability on other small-size datasets, bounding the utilization of existing large-scale datasets. To address this limitation, we propose a method based on continuous and stochastic representations of Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDE) for alleviating discrepancies due to data acquisition strategy. We utilize the benefits of continuous representation for handling arbitrary time steps and the use of stochastic representation for handling detector/tracker errors. Additionally, we propose a dataset-specific diffusion network and its training framework to handle dataset-specific detection/tracking errors. The effectiveness of our method is validated against state-of-the-art trajectory prediction models on the popular benchmark datasets: nuScenes, Argoverse, Lyft, INTERACTION, and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD).

    "abstract": "Generalization and sample efficiency have been long-standing issues concerning reinforcement learning, and thus the field of Offline Meta-Reinforcement Learning~(OMRL) has gained increasing attention due to its potential of solving a wide range of problems with static and limited offline data. Existing OMRL methods often assume sufficient training tasks and data coverage to apply contrastive learning to extract task representations. However, such assumptions are not applicable in several real-world applications and thus undermine the generalization ability of the representations. In this paper, we consider OMRL with two types of data limitations: limited training tasks and limited behavior diversity and propose a novel algorithm called GENTLE for learning generalizable task representations in the face of data limitations. GENTLE employs Task Auto-Encoder~(TAE), which is an encoder-decoder architecture to extract the characteristics of the tasks. Unlike existing methods, TAE is optimized solely by reconstruction of the state transition and reward, which captures the generative structure of the task models and produces generalizable representations when training tasks are limited. To alleviate the effect of limited behavior diversity, we consistently construct pseudo-transitions to align the data distribution used to train TAE with the data distribution encountered during testing. Empirically, GENTLE significantly outperforms existing OMRL methods on both in-distribution tasks and out-of-distribution tasks across both the given-context protocol and the one-shot protocol. ",

To tackle this challenge, we first introduce a prior-less anomaly generation paradigm and subsequently develop an innovative unsupervised anomaly detection framework named GRAD, grounded in this paradigm. GRAD comprises three essential components: (1) a diffusion model (PatchDiff) to generate contrastive patterns by preserving the local structures while disregarding the global structures present in normal images, (2) a self-supervised reweighting mechanism to handle the challenge of long-tailed and unlabeled contrastive patterns generated by PatchDiff, and (3) a lightweight patch-level detector to efficiently distinguish the normal patterns and reweighted contrastive patterns. The generation results of PatchDiff effectively expose various types of anomaly patterns, e.g. structural and logical anomaly patterns. In addition, extensive experiments on both MVTec AD and MVTec LOCO datasets also support the aforementioned observation and demonstrate that GRAD achieves competitive anomaly detection accuracy and superior inference speed.

We conduct evaluations on \\textbf{12} mainstream open-source models and \\textbf{2} outstanding proprietary models.

While correlation is a widely used analytical standard, it does not inherently imply causation. This paper addresses the potential for misinterpretation in relying solely on correlation, especially in the context of nonlinear dynamics. Despite the rapid development of various correlation research methodologies, including machine learning, the exploration into mining causal correlations between variables remains ongoing. Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM) emerges as a data-driven framework for modeling dynamic systems, distinguishing itself by eschewing traditional formulaic methods in data analysis. Instead, it reconstructs dynamic system behavior directly from time series data. The fundamental premise of EDM is that dynamic systems can be conceptualized as processes where a set of states, governed by specific rules, evolve over time in a high-dimensional space. By reconstructing these evolving states, dynamic systems can be effectively modeled. Using EDM, this paper explores the detection of causal relationships between variables within dynamic systems through their time series data. It posits that if variable X causes variable Y, then the information about X is inherent in Y and can be extracted from Y's data. This study begins by examining the dialectical relationship between correlation and causation, emphasizing that correlation does not equate to causation, and the absence of correlation does not necessarily indicate a lack of causation.

We further approximate the derived expressions using the Poisson limit theorem. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to validate the analytical findings, demonstrating a strong alignment between the analyses and simulations.

However, the DeepONet requires many parameters and has a high computational cost when learning operators, particularly those with complex (discontinuous or non-smooth) target functions. This study proposes HyperDeepONet, which uses the expressive power of the hypernetwork to enable the learning of a complex operator with a smaller set of parameters. The DeepONet and its variant models can be thought of as a method of injecting the input function information into the target function. From this perspective, these models can be viewed as a particular case of HyperDeepONet. We analyze the complexity of DeepONet and conclude that HyperDeepONet needs relatively lower complexity to obtain the desired accuracy for operator learning.

However, since existing approaches either demand the existence of multi-line similar code or randomly reference existing code, they can only repair a small number of bugs with many incorrect patches, hindering their wide application in practice. In this work, we aim to improve the effectiveness of redundancy-based APR by exploring more effective source code reuse methods for improving the number of correct patches and reducing incorrect patches. Specifically, we have proposed a new repair technique named Repatt, which incorporates a two-level pattern mining process for guiding effective patch generation (i.e., token and expression levels). We have conducted an extensive experiment on the widely-used Defects4J benchmark and compared Repatt with eight state-of-the-art APR approaches. The results show that our approach complements existing approaches by repairing {15} unique bugs compared with the latest deep learning-based methods and {19} unique bugs compared with traditional repair methods when providing the perfect fault localization. In addition, when the perfect fault localization is unknown in real practice, Repatt significantly outperforms the baseline approaches by achieving much higher patch precision, i.e., {83.8\\%}. Moreover, we further proposed an effective patch ranking strategy for combining the strength of Repatt and the baseline methods. The result shows that it repairs 124 bugs when only considering the Top-1 patches and improves the best-performing repair method by repairing 39 more bugs. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for practical use. ",

That means these isolated paths must reach the same ultimate target. As deep models show a great performance in modeling of highly nonlinear systems, aligning the representation space learned by these two models make the student model to inherit the approximation power of the teacher model. The proposed objective function consists of the objective of each student and teacher model adding up with a distance penalty between the learned latent representations.

To further apply the recalibrated graph contexts to the global domain, we propose the Graph Context Guidance Transformer. This module adopts a confident-based sampling strategy to temporarily screen high-confidence vertices for guiding accurate classification by searching global consensus between screened vertices and remaining ones. The extensive experimental results on outlier removal and relative pose estimation clearly demonstrate the superior performance of GCT-Net compared to state-of-the-art methods across outdoor and indoor datasets.

    "abstract": "Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for enhancing their utility in terms of helpfulness, truthfulness, safety, harmlessness, and interestingness. Existing methods for achieving this alignment often involves employing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune LLMs based on human labels assessing the relative quality of model responses. Nevertheless, RLHF is susceptible to instability during fine-tuning and presents challenges in implementation.Drawing inspiration from the emerging field of representation engineering (RepE), this study aims to identify relevant representations for high-level human preferences embedded in patterns of activity within an LLM, and achieve precise control of model behavior by transforming its representations. This novel approach, denoted as Representation Alignment from Human Feedback (RAHF), proves to be effective, computationally efficient, and easy to implement.Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of RAHF in not only capturing but also manipulating representations to align with a broad spectrum of human preferences or values, rather than being confined to a singular concept or function (e.g. honesty or bias). RAHF's versatility in accommodating diverse human preferences shows its potential for advancing LLM performance. ",

    "abstract": "Reliable estimation of terrain traversability is critical for the successful deployment of autonomous systems in wild, outdoor environments. Given the lack of large-scale annotated datasets for off-road navigation, strictly-supervised learning approaches remain limited in their generalization ability. To this end, we introduce a novel, image-based self-supervised learning method for traversability prediction, leveraging a state-of-the-art vision foundation model for improved out-of-distribution performance. Our method employs contrastive representation learning using both human driving data and instance-based segmentation masks during training. We show that this simple, yet effective, technique drastically outperforms recent methods in predicting traversability for both on- and off-trail driving scenarios. We compare our method with recent baselines on both a common benchmark as well as our own datasets, covering a diverse range of outdoor environments and varied terrain types. We also demonstrate the compatibility of resulting costmap predictions with a model-predictive controller. Finally, we evaluate our approach on zero- and few-shot tasks, demonstrating unprecedented performance for generalization to new environments.

From kinetic Monte Carlo simulations we analyze the critical nonlinear aspects of variable-range hopping transport for realizing Boolean logic gates in these devices on three levels. First, we quantify the occurrence of individual gates for random choices of control voltages. We find that linearly inseparable gates such as the XOR gate are less likely to occur than linearly separable gates such as the AND gate, despite the fact that the number of different regions in the multidimensional control voltage space for which AND or XOR gates occur is comparable. Second, we use principal component analysis to characterize the distribution of the output current vectors for the (00,10,01,11) logic input combinations in terms of eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the output covariance matrix. This allows a simple and direct comparison of the behavior of different simulated devices and a comparison to experimental devices. Third, we quantify the nonlinearity in the distribution of the output current vectors necessary for realizing Boolean functionality by introducing three nonlinearity indicators. The analysis provides a physical interpretation of the effects of changing the hopping distance and temperature and is used in a comparison with data generated by a deep neural network trained on a physical device.

Although some manually-designed models are proposed to raise accuracy, they are customized networks, which need to be repeatedly tried and verified, at a huge cost in time and labor. Therefore, a self-supervised neural architecture search (NAS) method without significant manual efforts called AdaNAS is proposed in this study to perform rainfall forecast post-processing and predict rainfall with high accuracy. In addition, we design a rainfall-aware search space to significantly improve forecasts for high-rainfall areas. Furthermore, we propose a rainfall-level regularization function to eliminate the effect of noise data during the training. Validation experiments have been performed under the cases of \\emph{None}, \\emph{Light}, \\emph{Moderate}, \\emph{Heavy} and \\emph{Violent} on a large-scale precipitation benchmark named TIGGE. Finally, the average mean-absolute error (MAE) and average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the proposed AdaNAS model are 0.98 and 2.04 mm/day, respectively. Additionally, the proposed AdaNAS model is compared with other neural architecture search methods and previous studies. Compared results reveal the satisfactory performance and superiority of the proposed AdaNAS model in terms of precipitation amount prediction and intensity classification. Concretely, the proposed AdaNAS model outperformed previous best-performing manual methods with MAE and RMSE improving by 80.5\\% and 80.3\\%, respectively. ",

To address these issues, we introduce a novel approach named Logically Consistent Chain-of-Thought (LC-CoT) for ZSSD, which improves stance detection by ensuring relevant and logically sound knowledge extraction. LC-CoT employs a three-step process. Initially, it assesses whether supplementary external knowledge is necessary. Subsequently, it uses API calls to retrieve this knowledge, which can be processed by a separate LLM. Finally, a manual exemplar guides the LLM to infer stance categories, using an if-then logical structure to maintain relevance and logical coherence. This structured approach to eliciting background knowledge enhances the model's capability, outperforming traditional supervised methods without relying on labeled data. ",

    "abstract": "(Source) code summarization is the task of automatically generating natural language summaries for given code snippets. Such summaries play a key role in helping developers understand and maintain source code. Recently, with the successful application of large language models (LLMs) in numerous fields, software engineering researchers have also attempted to adapt LLMs to solve code summarization tasks. The main adaptation schemes include instruction prompting and task-oriented fine-tuning. However, instruction prompting involves designing crafted prompts for zero-shot learning or selecting appropriate samples for few-shot learning and requires users to have professional domain knowledge, while task-oriented fine-tuning requires high training costs. In this paper, we propose a novel prompt learning framework for code summarization called PromptCS. PromptCS trains a prompt agent that can generate continuous prompts to unleash the potential for LLMs in code summarization. Compared to the human-written discrete prompt, the continuous prompts are produced under the guidance of LLMs and are therefore easier to understand by LLMs. PromptCS freezes the parameters of LLMs when training the prompt agent, which can greatly reduce the requirements for training resources. We evaluate PromptCS on the CodeSearchNet dataset involving multiple programming languages. The results show that PromptCS significantly outperforms instruction prompting schemes on all four widely used metrics. In some base LLMs, e.g., CodeGen-Multi-2B and StarCoderBase-1B and -3B, PromptCS even outperforms the task-oriented fine-tuning scheme. More importantly, the training efficiency of PromptCS is faster than the task-oriented fine-tuning scheme, with a more pronounced advantage on larger LLMs. The results of the human evaluation demonstrate that PromptCS can generate more good summaries compared to baselines.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study an underexplored, yet important and challenging problem: counting the number of distinct sounds in raw audio characterized by a high degree of polyphonicity. We do so by systematically proposing a novel end-to-end trainable neural network (which we call DyDecNet, consisting of a dyadic decomposition front-end and backbone network), and quantifying the difficulty level of counting depending on sound polyphonicity. The dyadic decomposition front-end progressively decomposes the raw waveform dyadically along the frequency axis to obtain time-frequency representation in multi-stage, coarse-to-fine manner. Each intermediate waveform convolved by a parent filter is further processed by a pair of child filters that evenly split the parent filter's carried frequency response, with the higher-half child filter encoding the detail and lower-half child filter encoding the approximation. We further introduce an energy gain normalization to normalize sound loudness variance and spectrum overlap, and apply it to each intermediate parent waveform before feeding it to the two child filters. To better quantify sound counting difficulty level, we further design three polyphony-aware metrics: polyphony ratio, max polyphony and mean polyphony. We test DyDecNet on various datasets to show its superiority, and we further show dyadic decomposition network can be used as a general front-end to tackle other acoustic tasks. ",

Data science has the property of discovering hidden patterns in case a sufficient volume of data is supplied. Time dependency of events, specifically being defined by co-occurrence in a specific time window, may be handled as an associate rule mining task such as a market-basket analysis application. In this regard, we assumed each day's seismic activity as a single basket of events, leading to discovering the association patterns between these events. Consequently, this study presents the most prominent association rules for the earthquakes recorded in Turkiye region in the last 5 years, each year presented separately. Results indicate statistical inference with events recorded from regions of various distances, which could be further verified with geologic evidence from the field. As a result, we believe that the current study may form a statistical basis for the future works with the aid of machine learning algorithm performed for associate rule mining. ",

    "abstract": "Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and surveillance systems. Yet, existing models often fail to fully leverage the non-verbal social cues human subconsciously communicate when navigating the space. To address this, we introduce Social-Transmotion, a generic model that exploits the power of transformers to handle diverse and numerous visual cues, capturing the multi-modal nature of human behavior. We translate the idea of a prompt from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to the task of human trajectory prediction, where a prompt can be a sequence of x-y coordinates on the ground, bounding boxes or body poses. This, in turn, augments trajectory data, leading to enhanced human trajectory prediction. Our model exhibits flexibility and adaptability by capturing spatiotemporal interactions between pedestrians based on the available visual cues, whether they are poses, bounding boxes, or a combination thereof. By the masking technique, we ensure our model's effectiveness even when certain visual cues are unavailable, although performance is further boosted with the presence of comprehensive visual data. We delve into the merits of using 2d versus 3d poses, and a limited set of poses. Additionally, we investigate the spatial and temporal attention map to identify which keypoints and frames of poses are vital for optimizing human trajectory prediction. Our approach is validated on multiple datasets, including JTA, JRDB, Pedestrians and Cyclists in Road Traffic, and ETH-UCY.

    "abstract": "Crystal material representation is the foundation of crystal material research. Existing works consider crystal molecules as graph data with different representation methods and leverage the advantages of techniques in graph learning. A reasonable crystal representation method should capture the local and global information. However, existing methods only consider the local information of crystal molecules by modeling the bond distance and bond angle of first-order neighbors of atoms, which leads to the issue that different crystals will have the same representation. To solve this many-to-one issue, we consider the global information by further considering dihedral angles, which can guarantee that the proposed representation corresponds one-to-one with the crystal material. We first propose a periodic complete representation and calculation algorithm for infinite extended crystal materials. A theoretical proof for the representation that satisfies the periodic completeness is provided. Based on the proposed representation, we then propose a network for predicting crystal material properties, PerCNet, with a specially designed message passing mechanism. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world material benchmark datasets. The PerCNet achieves the best performance among baseline methods in terms of MAE. In addition, our results demonstrate the importance of the periodic scheme and completeness for crystal representation learning. ",

Specifically, we define the connectome embedding, which holds the position, structure, and time information of the functional connectivity graph, and use Transformers to learn its representation across time. We perform experiments with over 50,000 resting-state fMRI samples obtained from three datasets, which is the largest number of fMRI data used in studies by far.

The development of such a technique hinges on the efficient fusion of heterogeneous multimodal features, which initially reside within distinct representation spaces. Naively fusing the multimodal features does not adequately capture the complementary information and could even produce redundancy. In this work, we present a novel joint self-supervised and supervised contrastive learning method to learn the robust latent feature representation from multimodal MRI data, allowing the projection of heterogeneous features into a shared common space, and thereby amalgamating both complementary and analogous information across various modalities and among similar subjects. We performed a comparative analysis between our proposed method and alternative deep multimodal learning approaches. Through extensive experiments on two independent datasets, the results demonstrated that our method is significantly superior to several other deep multimodal learning methods in predicting abnormal neurodevelopment. Our method has the capability to facilitate computer-aided diagnosis within clinical practice, harnessing the power of multimodal data. ",

This allows real-time Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) to be initiated at the very early stages of an occurring earthquake. When applied to substantial earthquake sequences across Japan and California (US), our models reliably report earthquake locations and magnitudes within 4 seconds after the first triggered station, with mean errors of 2.6-6.3 km and 0.05-0.17, respectively.

Human-sized systems operate the drive-field in the kHz range and generate it by utilizing strong currents that can rise to the kA range within a coil called the drive field generator. Matching and tuning between a power amplifier, a band-pass filter and the drive-field generator is required. Here, for reasons of safety in future human scanners, a symmetrical topology and a transformer, called inductive coupling network is used. Our primary objectives are to achieve floating potentials to ensure patient safety, attaining high linearity and high gain for the resonant transformer. We present a novel systematic approach to the design of a loss-optimized resonant toroid with a D-shaped cross section, employing segmentation to adjust the inductance-to-resistance ratio while maintaining a constant quality factor. Simultaneously, we derive a specific matching condition of a symmetric transmit-receive circuit for magnetic particle imaging. The chosen setup filters the fundamental frequency and allows simultaneous signal transmission and reception. In addition, the decoupling of multiple drive field channels is discussed and the primary side of the transformer is evaluated for maximum coupling and minimum stray field. Two prototypes were constructed, measured, decoupled, and compared to the derived theory and to method-of-moment based simulations. ",

Many recent studies have revisited its theoretical foundation for continuous control, which reveals elegant nonconvex geometry in various benchmark problems, especially in fully observable state-feedback cases. This paper considers two fundamental optimal and robust control problems with partial observability: the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control with stochastic noises, and $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ robust control with adversarial noises. In the policy space, the former problem is smooth but nonconvex, while the latter one is nonsmooth and nonconvex. We highlight some interesting and surprising ``discontinuity'' of LQG and $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ cost functions around the boundary of their domains. Despite the lack of convexity (and possibly smoothness), our main results show that for a class of non-degenerate policies, all Clarke stationary points are globally optimal and there is no spurious local minimum for both LQG and $\\mathcal{H}_\\infty$ control. Our proof techniques rely on a new and unified framework of Extended Convex Lifting (ECL), which reconciles the gap between nonconvex policy optimization and convex reformulations. This ECL framework is of independent interest, and we will discuss its details in Part II of this paper. ",

Previously, machine learning approaches employing either rule-based or string-based techniques to extract motifs. Rule-based approaches may extract motifs that aren't frequent or prevalent within the molecular data, which can lead to an incomplete understanding of essential structural patterns in molecules. String-based methods often lose the topological information inherent in molecules. This can be a significant drawback because topology plays a vital role in defining the spatial arrangement and connectivity of atoms within a molecule, which can be critical for understanding its properties and behavior. In this paper, we develop a data-driven motif extraction technique known as MotifPiece, which employs statistical measures to define motifs. To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of MotifPiece, we introduce a heterogeneous learning module. Our model shows an improvement compared to previously reported models. Additionally, we demonstrate that its performance can be further enhanced in two ways: first, by incorporating more data to aid in generating a richer motif vocabulary, and second, by merging multiple datasets that share enough motifs, allowing for cross-dataset learning.

Currently, most query-based separation models need additional networks to obtain query embedding. In this way, separation model is optimized to be adapted to the distribution of query embedding.

In this paper, we present CaRE-SEP, a consistent and relevant embedding network for general sound separation to encourage a comprehensive reconsideration of query usage in audio separation. CaRE-SEP alleviates the potential mismatch between queries and separation in two aspects, including sharing network structure and sharing feature information. First, a Swin-Unet model with a shared encoder is conducted to unify query encoding and sound separation into one model, eliminating the network architecture difference and generating consistent distribution of query and separation features. Second, by initializing CaRE-SEP with a pretrained classification network and allowing gradient backpropagation, the query embedding is optimized to be relevant to the separation feature, further alleviating the feature mismatch problem. Experimental results indicate the proposed CaRE-SEP model substantially improves the performance of separation tasks. Moreover, visualizations validate the potential mismatch and how CaRE-SEP solves it. ",

The conjecture is even more precise with a $1/2$ ratio, but even with larger ratio, this property is known to hold only for few classes of graphs. The focus here is on small quasi-kernels in split graphs. This family of graphs has played a special role in the study of the conjecture since it was used to disprove a strengthening that postulated the existence of two disjoint quasi-kernels. The paper proves that every sink-free split digraph $D$ has a quasi-kernel of size at most $\\frac{3}{4}|V(D)|$, and even of size at most two when the graph is an orientation of a complete split graph.

    "abstract": "Conformal Prediction (CP) stands out as a robust framework for uncertainty quantification, which is crucial for ensuring the reliability of predictions. However, common CP methods heavily rely on data exchangeability, a condition often violated in practice. Existing approaches for tackling non-exchangeability lead to methods that are not computable beyond the simplest examples. This work introduces a new efficient approach to CP that produces provably valid confidence sets for fairly general non-exchangeable data distributions. We illustrate the general theory with applications to the challenging setting of federated learning under data heterogeneity between agents. Our method allows constructing provably valid personalized prediction sets for agents in a fully federated way. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in a series of experiments on real-world datasets. ",

    "title": "Robust Survival Analysis with Adversarial Regularization",
    "abstract": "Survival Analysis (SA) is about modeling the time for an event of interest to occur, which has important applications in many fields, including medicine, defense, finance, and aerospace. Recent work has demonstrated the benefits of using Neural Networks (NNs) to capture complicated relationships in SA. However, the datasets used to train these models are often subject to uncertainty (e.g., noisy measurements, human error), which we show can substantially degrade the performance of existing techniques. To address this issue, this work leverages recent advances in NN verification to provide new algorithms for generating fully parametric survival models that are robust to such uncertainties. In particular, we introduce a robust loss function for training the models and use CROWN-IBP regularization to address the computational challenges with solving the resulting Min-Max problem. To evaluate the proposed approach, we apply relevant perturbations to publicly available datasets in the SurvSet repository and compare survival models against several baselines. We empirically show that Survival Analysis with Adversarial Regularization (SAWAR) method on average ranks best for dataset perturbations of varying magnitudes on metrics such as Negative Log Likelihood (NegLL), Integrated Brier Score (IBS), and Concordance Index (CI), concluding that adversarial regularization enhances performance in SA.
