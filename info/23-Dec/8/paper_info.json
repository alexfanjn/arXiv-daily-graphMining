    "title": "An Evaluation of State-of-the-Art Large Language Models for Sarcasm  Detection",
    "abstract": "Sarcasm, as defined by Merriam-Webster, is the use of words by someone who means the opposite of what he is trying to say. In the field of sentimental analysis of Natural Language Processing, the ability to correctly identify sarcasm is necessary for understanding people's true opinions. Because the use of sarcasm is often context-based, previous research has used language representation models, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to identify sarcasm with contextual-based information. Recent innovations in NLP have provided more possibilities for detecting sarcasm. In BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, Jacob Devlin et al. (2018) introduced a new language representation model and demonstrated higher precision in interpreting contextualized language. As proposed by Hazarika et al. (2018), CASCADE is a context-driven model that produces good results for detecting sarcasm. This study analyzes a Reddit corpus using these two state-of-the-art models and evaluates their performance against baseline models to find the ideal approach to sarcasm detection. ",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenges of multi-label text classification. The difficulties arise from imbalanced data sets, varied text lengths, and numerous subjective feature labels. Existing solutions include traditional machine learning and deep neural networks for predictions. However, both approaches have their limitations. Traditional machine learning often overlooks the associations between words, while deep neural networks, despite their better classification performance, come with increased training complexity and time. This paper proposes a method utilizing the bag-of-words model approach based on the GloVe model and the CNN-BiLSTM network. The principle is to use the word vector matrix trained by the GloVe model as the input for the text embedding layer. Given that the GloVe model requires no further training, the neural network model can be trained more efficiently. The method achieves an accuracy rate of 87.26% on the test set and an F1 score of 0.8737, showcasing promising results. ",

    "abstract": "There has been increasing interest in evaluations of language models for a variety of risks and characteristics. Evaluations relying on natural language understanding for grading can often be performed at scale by using other language models. We test the robustness of these model-graded evaluations to injections on different datasets including a new Deception Eval. These injections resemble direct communication between the testee and the evaluator to change their grading. We extrapolate that future, more intelligent models might manipulate or cooperate with their evaluation model. We find significant susceptibility to these injections in state-of-the-art commercial models on all examined evaluations. Furthermore, similar injections can be used on automated interpretability frameworks to produce misleading model-written explanations. The results inspire future work and should caution against unqualified trust in evaluations and automated interpretability. ",

    "abstract": "We present a framework SCStory for online story discovery, that helps people digest rapidly published news article streams in real-time without human annotations. To organize news article streams into stories, existing approaches directly encode the articles and cluster them based on representation similarity. However, these methods yield noisy and inaccurate story discovery results because the generic article embeddings do not effectively reflect the story-indicative semantics in an article and cannot adapt to the rapidly evolving news article streams. SCStory employs self-supervised and continual learning with a novel idea of story-indicative adaptive modeling of news article streams. With a lightweight hierarchical embedding module that first learns sentence representations and then article representations, SCStory identifies story-relevant information of news articles and uses them to discover stories. The embedding module is continuously updated to adapt to evolving news streams with a contrastive learning objective, backed up by two unique techniques, confidence-aware memory replay and prioritized-augmentation, employed for label absence and data scarcity problems. Thorough experiments on real and the latest news data sets demonstrate that SCStory outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms for unsupervised online story discovery. ",

    "abstract": "The social and implicit nature of human communication ramifies readers' understandings of written sentences. Single gold-standard interpretations rarely exist, challenging conventional assumptions in natural language processing. This work introduces the interpretation modeling (IM) task which involves modeling several interpretations of a sentence's underlying semantics to unearth layers of implicit meaning. To obtain these, IM is guided by multiple annotations of social relation and common ground - in this work approximated by reader attitudes towards the author and their understanding of moral judgments subtly embedded in the sentence. We propose a number of modeling strategies that rely on one-to-one and one-to-many generation methods that take inspiration from the philosophical study of interpretation. A first-of-its-kind IM dataset is curated to support experiments and analyses. The modeling results, coupled with scrutiny of the dataset, underline the challenges of IM as conflicting and complex interpretations are socially plausible. This interplay of diverse readings is affirmed by automated and human evaluations on the generated interpretations. Finally, toxicity analyses in the generated interpretations demonstrate the importance of IM for refining filters of content and assisting content moderators in safeguarding the safety in online discourse.

    "abstract": "Graphs can inherently model interconnected objects on the Web, thereby facilitating a series of Web applications, such as web analyzing and content recommendation. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique for graph representation learning. However, their efficacy within an end-to-end supervised framework is significantly tied to the availabilityof task-specific labels. To mitigate labeling costs and enhance robustness in few-shot settings, pre-training on self-supervised tasks has emerged as a promising method, while prompting has been proposed to further narrow the objective gap between pretext and downstream tasks. Although there has been some initial exploration of prompt-based learning on graphs, they primarily leverage a single pretext task, resulting in a limited subset of general knowledge that could be learned from the pre-training data. Hence, in this paper, we propose MultiGPrompt, a novel multi-task pre-training and prompting framework to exploit multiple pretext tasks for more comprehensive pre-trained knowledge. First, in pre-training, we design a set of pretext tokens to synergize multiple pretext tasks. Second, we propose a dual-prompt mechanism consisting of composed and open prompts to leverage task-specific and global pre-training knowledge, to guide downstream tasks in few-shot settings. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on six public datasets to evaluate and analyze MultiGPrompt. ",

This strategy blends diverse dependency relations prior to the application of GNNs, enhancing robustness against parsing errors while avoiding extra computational burdens. SynthFusion circumvents the pitfalls of overparameterization and diminishes the risk of overfitting, prevalent in models with stacked GNN layers, by optimizing graph connectivity. Our empirical evaluations on the SemEval14 and Twitter14 datasets affirm that SynthFusion not only outshines models reliant on single dependency trees but also eclipses alternative ensemble techniques, achieving this without an escalation in model complexity.

However, strict privacy regulations limit access to comprehensive health records, making it challenging to apply standard machine learning algorithms in practical real-world scenarios. Previous research has addressed this data limitation by incorporating medical ontologies and employing transfer learning methods. In this study, we investigate the potential of leveraging language models (LMs) as a means to incorporate supplementary domain knowledge for improving the performance of various EHR-based risk prediction tasks. Unlike applying LMs to unstructured EHR data such as clinical notes, this study focuses on using textual descriptions within structured EHR to make predictions exclusively based on that information. We extensively compare against previous approaches across various data types and sizes. We find that employing LMs to represent structured EHRs, such as diagnostic histories, leads to improved or at least comparable performance in diverse risk prediction tasks. Furthermore, LM-based approaches offer numerous advantages, including few-shot learning, the capability to handle previously unseen medical concepts, and adaptability to various medical vocabularies. Nevertheless, we underscore, through various experiments, the importance of being cautious when employing such models, as concerns regarding the reliability of LMs persist. ",

    "abstract": "It is essential that healthcare professionals and members of the healthcare community can access and easily understand patient experiences in the real world, so that care standards can be improved and driven towards personalised drug treatment. Social media platforms and message boards are deemed suitable sources of patient experience information, as patients have been observed to discuss and exchange knowledge, look for and provide support online. This paper tests the hypothesis that not all online patient experience information can be treated and collected in the same way, as a result of the inherent differences in the way individuals talk about their journeys, in different therapeutic domains and or data sources. We used linguistic analysis to understand and identify similarities between datasets, across patient language, between data sources (Reddit, SocialGist) and therapeutic domains (cardiovascular, oncology, immunology, neurology). We detected common vocabulary used by patients in the same therapeutic domain across data sources, except for immunology patients, who use unique vocabulary between the two data sources, and compared to all other datasets. We combined linguistically similar datasets to train classifiers (CNN, transformer) to accurately identify patient experience posts from social media, a task we refer to as patient voice classification. The cardiovascular and neurology transformer classifiers perform the best in their respective comparisons for the Reddit data source, achieving F1-scores of 0.865 and 1.0 respectively. The overall best performing classifier is the transformer classifier trained on all data collected for this experiment, achieving F1-scores ranging between 0.863 and 0.995 across all therapeutic domain and data source specific test datasets.

    "abstract": "Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC) is a critical aspect of affective computing, and it has many practical applications in healthcare, education, chatbots, and social media platforms. Earlier approaches for ERC analysis involved modeling both speaker and long-term contextual information using graph neural network architectures. However, it is ideal to deploy speaker-independent models for real-world applications. Additionally, long context windows can potentially create confusion in recognizing the emotion of an utterance in a conversation. To overcome these limitations, we propose novel line conversation graph convolutional network (LineConGCN) and graph attention (LineConGAT) models for ERC analysis. These models are speaker-independent and built using a graph construction strategy for conversations -- line conversation graphs (LineConGraphs). The conversational context in LineConGraphs is short-term -- limited to one previous and future utterance, and speaker information is not part of the graph. We evaluate the performance of our proposed models on two benchmark datasets, IEMOCAP and MELD, and show that our LineConGAT model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with an F1-score of 64.58% and 76.50%. Moreover, we demonstrate that embedding sentiment shift information into line conversation graphs further enhances the ERC performance in the case of GCN models. ",

    "abstract": "Predicting stock market is vital for investors and policymakers, acting as a barometer of the economic health. We leverage social media data, a potent source of public sentiment, in tandem with macroeconomic indicators as government-compiled statistics, to refine stock market predictions. However, prior research using tweet data for stock market prediction faces three challenges. First, the quality of tweets varies widely. While many are filled with noise and irrelevant details, only a few genuinely mirror the actual market scenario. Second, solely focusing on the historical data of a particular stock without considering its sector can lead to oversight. Stocks within the same industry often exhibit correlated price behaviors. Lastly, simply forecasting the direction of price movement without assessing its magnitude is of limited value, as the extent of the rise or fall truly determines profitability. In this paper, diverging from the conventional methods, we pioneer an ECON. The framework has following advantages: First, ECON has an adept tweets filter that efficiently extracts and decodes the vast array of tweet data. Second, ECON discerns multi-level relationships among stocks, sectors, and macroeconomic factors through a self-aware mechanism in semantic space. Third, ECON offers enhanced accuracy in predicting substantial stock price fluctuations by capitalizing on stock price movement. We showcase the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed model using a dataset, specifically curated by us, for predicting stock market movements and volatility. ",

We conduct a comprehensive study of the robustness of various LMMs against different adversarial attacks, evaluated across tasks including image classification, image captioning, and Visual Question Answer (VQA). We find that in general LMMs are not robust to visual adversarial inputs. However, our findings suggest that context provided to the model via prompts, such as questions in a QA pair helps to mitigate the effects of visual adversarial inputs. Notably, the LMMs evaluated demonstrated remarkable resilience to such attacks on the ScienceQA task with only an 8.10% drop in performance compared to their visual counterparts which dropped 99.73%. We also propose a new approach to real-world image classification which we term query decomposition. By incorporating existence queries into our input prompt we observe diminished attack effectiveness and improvements in image classification accuracy. This research highlights a previously under-explored facet of LMM robustness and sets the stage for future work aimed at strengthening the resilience of multimodal systems in adversarial environments.

Pessimists believe that AIGC will replace humans in the future, and optimists think that it will further liberate productivity. Public emotions play a crucial role on social media platforms. They can provide valuable insights into the public's opinions, attitudes, and behaviors. There is a lack of research on the analysis of social group emotions triggered by AIGC content, and even more on the cross-platform differences of group emotions. This study fills the research gap by connecting the theory of group dynamics with emotions in social media. Specifically, we develop a scientific group emotion calculation and visualization system based on chains of communication. The system is capable of crawling data in real time and presenting the current state of group emotions in a fine-grained manner. We then analyze which group dynamic factors drive different public emotions towards nine AIGC products on the three most popular social media platforms in China. Finally, we obtain four main findings. First, Douyin is the only platform with negative group emotion on emerging AI technologies. Second, Weibo users prefer extreme emotions more than others. Third, the group emotion varies by education and age. It is negatively correlated with senior high school or lower and 25 or younger, and positively correlated with bachelor's degree or higher and 26-35. Fourth, the group emotion polarization increases with more posts without comments and celebrity publishers. By analyzing the key dynamic factors of group emotions to AIGC on various social media platforms, we can improve our products and services, develop more effective marketing strategies, and create more accurate and effective AI models to solve complex problems.

The challenge arises from the limited data availability and the low signal-to-noise ratio of fMRI signals, leading to a low-precision task of fMRI-to-image retrieval. State-of-the-art MindEye remarkably improves fMRI-to-image retrieval performance by leveraging a deep MLP with a high parameter count orders of magnitude, i.e., a 996M MLP Backbone per subject, to align fMRI embeddings to the final hidden layer of CLIP's vision transformer. However, significant individual variations exist among subjects, even within identical experimental setups, mandating the training of subject-specific models. The substantial parameters pose significant challenges in deploying fMRI decoding on practical devices, especially with the necessitating of specific models for each subject.

Our experiments demonstrate that Lite-Mind achieves an impressive 94.3% fMRI-to-image retrieval accuracy on the NSD dataset for Subject 1, with 98.7% fewer parameters than MindEye.

The study employs LangDetect, LangId, FastText, and Sentence Transformer on a dataset encompassing 17 languages. It explores dimensionality's impact on clustering, revealing FastText's clearer clustering in 2D visualization due to its extensive multilingual corpus training. Notably, the FastText multi-layer perceptron model achieved remarkable accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, outperforming the Sentence Transformer model. The study underscores the effectiveness of these techniques in multilingual text classification, emphasizing the importance of large multilingual corpora for training embeddings.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal biomedical time series (MBTS) data offers a holistic view of the physiological state, holding significant importance in various bio-medical applications. Owing to inherent noise and distribution gaps across different modalities, MBTS can be complex to model. Various deep learning models have been developed to learn representations of MBTS but still fall short in robustness due to the ignorance of modal-to-modal variations. This paper presents a multi-scale and multi-modal biomedical time series representation learning (MBSL) network with contrastive learning to migrate these variations. Firstly, MBTS is grouped based on inter-modal distances, then each group with minimum intra-modal variations can be effectively modeled by individual encoders. Besides, to enhance the multi-scale feature extraction (encoder), various patch lengths and mask ratios are designed to generate tokens with semantic information at different scales and diverse contextual perspectives respectively. Finally, cross-modal contrastive learning is proposed to maximize consistency among inter-modal groups, maintaining useful information and eliminating noises. Experiments against four bio-medical applications show that MBSL outperforms state-of-the-art models by 33.9% mean average errors (MAE) in respiration rate, by 13.8% MAE in exercise heart rate, by 1.41% accuracy in human activity recognition, and by 1.14% F1-score in obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) alleviates large labeling efforts by training exclusively on unlabeled in-distribution data and detecting outliers as anomalies. Generally, the assumption prevails that large training datasets allow the training of higher-performing UAD models. However, in this work, we show that using only very few training samples can already match - and in some cases even improve - anomaly detection compared to training with the whole training dataset. We propose three methods to identify prototypical samples from a large dataset of in-distribution samples. We demonstrate that by training with a subset of just ten such samples, we achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of $96.37 \\%$ on CIFAR10, $92.59 \\%$ on CIFAR100, $95.37 \\%$ on MNIST, $95.38 \\%$ on Fashion-MNIST, $96.37 \\%$ on MVTec-AD, $98.81 \\%$ on BraTS, and $81.95 \\%$ on RSNA pneumonia detection, even exceeding the performance of full training in $25/67$ classes we tested. Additionally, we show that the prototypical in-distribution samples identified by our proposed methods translate well to different models and other datasets and that using their characteristics as guidance allows for successful manual selection of small subsets of high-performing samples.

In the graph homomorphism problem, denoted by $Hom(H)$, the graph $H$ is fixed and we need to determine if there exists a homomorphism from an instance graph $G$ to $H$. We study the complexity of the problem parameterized by the cutwidth of $G$. We aim, for each $H$, for algorithms for $Hom(H)$ running in time $c_H^k n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ and matching lower bounds that exclude $c_H^{k \\cdot o(1)}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ or $c_H^{k(1-\\Omega(1))}n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time algorithms under the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis. In the paper we introduce a new parameter that we call $\\mathrm{mimsup}(H)$. Our main contribution is strong evidence of a close connection between $c_H$ and $\\mathrm{mimsup}(H)$: * an information-theoretic argument that the number of states needed in a natural dynamic programming algorithm is at most $\\mathrm{mimsup}(H)^k$, * lower bounds that show that for almost all graphs $H$ indeed we have $c_H \\geq \\mathrm{mimsup}(H)$, assuming the (Strong) Exponential-Time Hypothesis, and * an algorithm with running time $\\exp ( {\\mathcal{O}( \\mathrm{mimsup}(H) \\cdot k \\log k)}) n^{\\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The parameter $\\mathrm{mimsup}(H)$ can be thought of as the $p$-th root of the maximum induced matching number in the graph obtained by multiplying $p$ copies of $H$ via certain graph product, where $p$ tends to infinity. It can also be defined as an asymptotic rank parameter of the adjacency matrix of $H$. Our results tightly link the parameterized complexity of a problem to such an asymptotic rank parameter for the first time. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are often trained to predict the outcome resulting from a human decision. For example, if a doctor decides to test a patient for disease, will the patient test positive? A challenge is that the human decision censors the outcome data: we only observe test outcomes for patients doctors historically tested. Untested patients, for whom outcomes are unobserved, may differ from tested patients along observed and unobserved dimensions. We propose a Bayesian model class which captures this setting. The purpose of the model is to accurately estimate risk for both tested and untested patients. Estimating this model is challenging due to the wide range of possibilities for untested patients. To address this, we propose two domain constraints which are plausible in health settings: a prevalence constraint, where the overall disease prevalence is known, and an expertise constraint, where the human decision-maker deviates from purely risk-based decision-making only along a constrained feature set. We show theoretically and on synthetic data that domain constraints improve parameter inference. We apply our model to a case study of cancer risk prediction, showing that the model's inferred risk predicts cancer diagnoses, its inferred testing policy captures known public health policies, and it can identify suboptimalities in test allocation. Though our case study is in healthcare, our analysis reveals a general class of domain constraints which can improve model estimation in many settings. ",

    "abstract": "Internet-of-Things (IoT) is rapidly growing in wireless technology, aiming to connect vast numbers of devices to gather and distribute vital information. Despite individual devices having low energy consumption, the cumulative demand results in significant energy usage. Consequently, the concept of ultra-low-power tags gains appeal. Such tags communicate by reflecting rather than generating the radio frequency (RF) signals by themselves. Thus, these backscatter tags can be low-cost and battery-free. The RF signals can be ambient sources such as wireless-fidelity (Wi-Fi), cellular, or television (TV) signals, or the system can generate them externally. Backscatter channel characteristics are different from conventional point-to-point or cooperative relay channels. These systems are also affected by a strong interference link between the RF source and the tag besides the direct and backscattering links, making signal detection challenging. This paper provides an overview of the fundamentals, challenges, and ongoing research in signal detection for AmBC networks. It delves into various detection methods, discussing their advantages and drawbacks. The paper's emphasis on signal detection sets it apart and positions it as a valuable resource for IoT and wireless communication professionals and researchers. ",

This framework encompasses many common use-cases, such as training neural networks by gradient descent. First, we propose a computationally inexpensive technique providing higher-order information on $\\mathcal{L}$, especially about the interactions between the tensors $\\mathbf{T}_s$, based on automatic differentiation and computational tricks. Second, we use this technique at order 2 to build a second-order optimization method which is suitable, among other things, for training deep neural networks of various architectures. This second-order method leverages the partition structure of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ into tensors $(\\mathbf{T}_1, \\cdots, \\mathbf{T}_S)$, in such a way that it requires neither the computation of the Hessian of $\\mathcal{L}$ according to $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, nor any approximation of it. The key part consists in computing a smaller matrix interpretable as a \"Hessian according to the partition\", which can be computed exactly and efficiently. In contrast to many existing practical second-order methods used in neural networks, which perform a diagonal or block-diagonal approximation of the Hessian or its inverse, the method we propose does not neglect interactions between layers. Finally, we can tune the coarseness of the partition to recover well-known optimization methods: the coarsest case corresponds to Cauchy's steepest descent method, the finest case corresponds to the usual Newton's method.

Most of these methods require a predefined graph as input, whereas in real-life multivariate time series problems, a well-predefined dependency graph rarely exists. This requirement makes it harder for GNNs to be utilised widely for multivariate forecasting problems in other domains such as retail or energy. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach combining neural networks and statistical structure learning models to self-learn the dependencies and construct a dynamically changing dependency graph from multivariate data aiming to enable the use of GNNs for multivariate forecasting even when a well-defined graph does not exist. The statistical structure modeling in conjunction with neural networks provides a well-principled and efficient approach by bringing in causal semantics to determine dependencies among the series. Finally, we demonstrate significantly improved performance using our proposed approach on real-world benchmark datasets without a pre-defined dependency graph. ",

In this work, we evaluated Android data safety labels and explored how differences between the two label designs impact user comprehension and label utility. We conducted a between-subjects, semi-structured interview study with 12 Android users and 12 iOS users. While some users found Android Data Safety Labels informative and helpful, other users found them too vague. Compared to iOS App Privacy Labels, Android users found the distinction between data collection groups more intuitive and found explicit inclusion of omitted data collection groups more salient. However, some users expressed skepticism regarding elided information about collected data type categories. Most users missed critical information due to not expanding the accordion interface, and they were surprised by collection practices excluded from Android's definitions.

This is particularly significant for the unbanked population, which lacks access to standard financial services.

We compare the efficiency of interconnected mesh nodes (complete graph topology) with central routing nodes (star graph topology), with a specific focus on the dual central node approach. This approach introduces features like circular rebalancing, redundancy, and a closed network system. Through a basic SimPy model, we assess the network's throughput in a 100 node scenario. While this approach centralizes a technology initially designed for decentralization, it fosters broader enterprise adoption of Bitcoin-based payment networks and encourages participation in the decentralized financial ecosystem. Our study also considers the regulatory implications of using central routing nodes, possibly classified as payment processors under Money Transmission Laws (MTL). These findings aim to contribute to the discourse on the Lightning Network's application in business, highlighting its potential to drive shifts in financial technology towards more decentralized systems.

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{T2T-BinFormer} which is a novel document binarization encoder-decoder architecture based on a Tokens-to-token vision transformer. Each image is divided into a set of tokens with a defined length using the ViT model, which is then applied several times to model the global relationship between the tokens. However, the conventional tokenization of input data does not adequately reflect the crucial local structure between adjacent pixels of the input image, which results in low efficiency. Instead of using a simple ViT and hard splitting of images for the document image enhancement task, we employed a progressive tokenization technique to capture this local information from an image to achieve more effective results. Experiments on various DIBCO and H-DIBCO benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the existing CNN and ViT-based state-of-the-art methods. In this research, the primary area of examination is the application of the proposed architecture to the task of document binarization.

In this paper, we propose a data-driven, model-free pathloss map prediction (PMP) method, called PMNet. PMNet uses a supervised learning approach: it is trained on a limited amount of RT (or channel measurement) data and map data. Once trained, PMNet can predict pathloss over location with high accuracy (an RMSE level of $10^{-2}$) in a few milliseconds. We further extend PMNet by employing transfer learning (TL). TL allows PMNet to learn a new network scenario quickly (x5.6 faster training) and efficiently (using x4.5 less data) by transferring knowledge from a pre-trained model, while retaining accuracy. Our results demonstrate that PMNet is a scalable and generalizable ML-based PMP method, showing its potential to be used in several network optimization applications. ",

To bridge this gap, we introduce the node-aware bi-smoothing framework, which is the first certifiably robust approach for general node classification tasks against GIAs. Notably, the proposed node-aware bi-smoothing scheme is model-agnostic and is applicable for both evasion and poisoning attacks. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, we establish the certifiable conditions of our smoothing scheme. We also explore the practical implications of our node-aware bi-smoothing schemes in two contexts: as an empirical defense approach against real-world GIAs and in the context of recommendation systems. Furthermore, we extend two state-of-the-art certified robustness frameworks to address node injection attacks and compare our approach against them.

It will be an interesting topic about how to leverage the capability of stable diffusion to elevate the image variations of certain categories (e.g., vehicles, humans, and daily objects); particularly, it has the potential to gain improvements for small datasets with image-sparse categories. This study utilized seven categories in the popular COCO dataset and three widespread weed species in Michigan to evaluate the efficiency of a recent version of stable diffusion. In detail, Stable diffusion was used to generate synthetic images belonging to these classes; then, YOLOv8 models were trained based on these synthetic images, whose performance was compared to the models trained on original images. In addition, several techniques (e.g., Image-to-image translation, Dreambooth, ControlNet) of Stable diffusion were leveraged for image generation with different focuses. In spite of the overall results being disappointing, promising results have been achieved in some classes, illustrating the potential of stable diffusion models to improve the performance of detection models, which represent more helpful information being conveyed into the models by the generated images. This seminal study may expedite the adaption of stable diffusion models to classification and detection tasks in different fields. ",

    "abstract": "We argue that time series analysis is fundamentally different in nature to either vision or natural language processing with respect to the forms of meaningful self-supervised learning tasks that can be defined. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a novel approach called \\textit{Series2Vec} for self-supervised representation learning. Unlike other self-supervised methods in time series, which carry the risk of positive sample variants being less similar to the anchor sample than series in the negative set, Series2Vec is trained to predict the similarity between two series in both temporal and spectral domains through a self-supervised task. Series2Vec relies primarily on the consistency of the unsupervised similarity step, rather than the intrinsic quality of the similarity measurement, without the need for hand-crafted data augmentation. To further enforce the network to learn similar representations for similar time series, we propose a novel approach that applies order-invariant attention to each representation within the batch during training. Our evaluation of Series2Vec on nine large real-world datasets, along with the UCR/UEA archive, shows enhanced performance compared to current state-of-the-art self-supervised techniques for time series. Additionally, our extensive experiments show that Series2Vec performs comparably with fully supervised training and offers high efficiency in datasets with limited-labeled data. Finally, we show that the fusion of Series2Vec with other representation learning models leads to enhanced performance for time series classification.

    "abstract": "Joint embedding (JE) architectures have emerged as a promising avenue for acquiring transferable data representations. A key obstacle to using JE methods, however, is the inherent challenge of evaluating learned representations without access to a downstream task, and an annotated dataset. Without efficient and reliable evaluation, it is difficult to iterate on architectural and training choices for JE methods. In this paper, we introduce LiDAR (Linear Discriminant Analysis Rank), a metric designed to measure the quality of representations within JE architectures. Our metric addresses several shortcomings of recent approaches based on feature covariance rank by discriminating between informative and uninformative features. In essence, LiDAR quantifies the rank of the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) matrix associated with the surrogate SSL task -- a measure that intuitively captures the information content as it pertains to solving the SSL task. We empirically demonstrate that LiDAR significantly surpasses naive rank based approaches in its predictive power of optimal hyperparameters. Our proposed criterion presents a more robust and intuitive means of assessing the quality of representations within JE architectures, which we hope facilitates broader adoption of these powerful techniques in various domains.

Therefore, a potential attack surface can be to inject poisonous data into the training data to make models vulnerable, aka trojaned. It can pose a significant threat by hiding manipulative behaviors inside models, leading to compromising the integrity of the models in downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose an occlusion-based human-in-the-loop technique, OSeql, to distinguish trojan-triggering inputs of code. The technique is based on the observation that trojaned neural models of code rely heavily on the triggering part of input; hence, its removal would change the confidence of the models in their prediction substantially. Our results suggest that OSeql can detect the triggering inputs with almost 100% recall. We discuss the problem of false positives and how to address them.

While these methods effectively capture the overall sample distribution in the entire learned latent space, they tend to distort the structure of sample distributions within specific classes in the subset of the latent space. This distortion complicates the task of easily distinguishing classes identifiable by neural networks. In response to this challenge, we introduce the k* Distribution methodology. This approach focuses on capturing the characteristics and structure of sample distributions for individual classes within the subset of the learned latent space using local neighborhood analysis. The key concept is to facilitate easy comparison of different k* distributions, enabling analysis of how various classes are processed by the same neural network. This provides a more profound understanding of existing contemporary visualizations. Our study reveals three distinct distributions of samples within the learned latent space subset: a) Fractured, b) Overlapped, and c) Clustered. We note and demonstrate that the distribution of samples within the network's learned latent space significantly varies depending on the class. Furthermore, we illustrate that our analysis can be applied to explore the latent space of diverse neural network architectures, various layers within neural networks, transformations applied to input samples, and the distribution of training and testing data for neural networks. We anticipate that our approach will facilitate more targeted investigations into neural networks by collectively examining the distribution of different samples within the learned latent space. ",

    "abstract": "The escalating size of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has spurred a growing research interest in hosting and serving DNN models across multiple devices. A number of studies have been reported to partition a DNN model across devices, providing device placement solutions. The methods appeared in the literature, however, either suffer from poor placement performance due to the exponential search space or miss an optimal placement as a consequence of the reduced search space with limited heuristics. Moreover, these methods have ignored the runtime inter-operator optimization of a computation graph when coarsening the graph, which degrades the end-to-end inference performance. This paper presents Moirai that better exploits runtime inter-operator fusion in a model to render a coarsened computation graph, reducing the search space while maintaining the inter-operator optimization provided by inference backends. Moirai also generalizes the device placement algorithm from multiple perspectives by considering inference constraints and device heterogeneity.Extensive experimental evaluation with 11 large DNNs demonstrates that Moirai outperforms the state-of-the-art counterparts, i.e., Placeto, m-SCT, and GETF, up to 4.28$\\times$ in reduction of the end-to-end inference latency.

However, the challenges persist due to the limitations imposed by data discretization and model linearity, which hinder the precise capture of identity and expression clues in current studies. This paper presents a novel 3D morphable face model, named ImFace++, to learn a sophisticated and continuous space with implicit neural representations. ImFace++ first constructs two explicitly disentangled deformation fields to model complex shapes associated with identities and expressions, respectively, which simultaneously facilitate the automatic learning of correspondences across diverse facial shapes. To capture more sophisticated facial details, a refinement displacement field within the template space is further incorporated, enabling a fine-grained learning of individual-specific facial details. Furthermore, a Neural Blend-Field is designed to reinforce the representation capabilities through adaptive blending of an array of local fields. In addition to ImFace++, we have devised an improved learning strategy to extend expression embeddings, allowing for a broader range of expression variations. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that ImFace++ significantly advances the state-of-the-art in terms of both face reconstruction fidelity and correspondence accuracy.

Several perspectives of robustness for LMs have been studied independently, but lacking a unified consideration in multiple perspectives. In this paper, we propose Robustifying LMs via Adversarial perturbation with Selective Training (RoAST), a simple yet effective fine-tuning technique to enhance the multi-perspective robustness of LMs in a unified way. RoAST effectively incorporates two important sources for the model robustness, robustness on the perturbed inputs and generalizable knowledge in pre-trained LMs. To be specific, RoAST introduces adversarial perturbation during fine-tuning while the model parameters are selectively updated upon their relative importance to minimize unnecessary deviation. Under a unified evaluation of fine-tuned LMs by incorporating four representative perspectives of model robustness, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RoAST compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods on six different types of LMs, which indicates its usefulness in practice.

However, they also raise security concerns regarding their vulnerability to power side-channel attacks (SCA). In these attacks, the adversary exploits unintended communication channels to infer sensitive information processed by the accelerator, posing significant privacy and copyright risks to the models. Advanced machine learning algorithms are further employed to facilitate the side-channel analysis and exacerbate the privacy issue of AI accelerators. Traditional defense strategies naively inject execution noise to the runtime of AI models, which inevitably introduce large overheads. In this paper, we present AIAShield, a novel defense methodology to safeguard FPGA-based AI accelerators and mitigate model extraction threats via power-based SCAs. The key insight of AIAShield is to leverage the prominent adversarial attack technique from the machine learning community to craft delicate noise, which can significantly obfuscate the adversary's side-channel observation while incurring minimal overhead to the execution of the protected model. At the hardware level, we design a new module based on ring oscillators to achieve fine-grained noise generation. At the algorithm level, we repurpose Neural Architecture Search to worsen the adversary's extraction results. Extensive experiments on the Nvidia Deep Learning Accelerator (NVDLA) demonstrate that AIAShield outperforms existing solutions with excellent transferability. ",

In the application of autonomous driving, autonomous vehicles need to be aware of their surroundings to drive safely. However, current BEV semantic segmentation techniques, deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, have difficulties in obtaining the global semantic relationships of the surroundings at the early layers of the network. In this paper, we propose to incorporate a novel Residual Graph Convolutional (RGC) module in deep CNNs to acquire both the global information and the region-level semantic relationship in the multi-view image domain. Specifically, the RGC module employs a non-overlapping graph space projection to efficiently project the complete BEV information into graph space. It then builds interconnected spatial and channel graphs to extract spatial information between each node and channel information within each node (i.e., extract contextual relationships of the global features). Furthermore, it uses a downsample residual process to enhance the coordinate feature reuse to maintain the global information. The segmentation data augmentation and alignment module helps to simultaneously augment and align BEV features and ground truth to geometrically preserve their alignment to achieve better segmentation results. Our experimental results on the nuScenes benchmark dataset demonstrate that the RGC network outperforms four state-of-the-art networks and its four variants in terms of IoU and mIoU. The proposed RGC network achieves a higher mIoU of 3.1% than the best state-of-the-art network, BEVFusion. Code and models will be released. ",

This need has inspired numerous research efforts on the development of misinformation detection (MD) models. However, many models do not use all information available to them and existing research contains a lack of relevant datasets to train the models, specifically within the South African social media environment. The aim of this paper is to investigate the transferability of knowledge of a MD model between different contextual environments. This research contributes a multimodal MD model capable of functioning in the South African social media environment, as well as introduces a South African misinformation dataset. The model makes use of multiple sources of information for misinformation detection, namely: textual and visual elements. It uses bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as the textual encoder and a residual network (ResNet) as the visual encoder. The model is trained and evaluated on the Fakeddit dataset and a South African misinformation dataset. Results show that using South African samples in the training of the model increases model performance, in a South African contextual environment, and that a multimodal model retains significantly more knowledge than both the textual and visual unimodal models. Our study suggests that the performance of a misinformation detection model is influenced by the cultural nuances of its operating environment and multimodal models assist in the transferability of knowledge between different contextual environments. Therefore, local data should be incorporated into the training process of a misinformation detection model in order to optimize model performance. ",

We consider a fluid queueing model that facilitates explicit characterization of the queueing delay of packets, and establish explicit conditions on link rates that can minimize the average and maximum queueing delay in both single-hop and multi-stage (switching) networks. These min-delay conditions require maintaining an identical ratio between the ingress and egress rates of different nodes at the same layer of the network. We term the policies that follow these conditions rate-proportional policies. We further generalize the rate-proportional policies to queue-proportional policies, which minimize the queueing delay asymptotically based on the time-varying queue length while remaining agnostic of packet arrival rates. We validate that the proposed policies lead to minimum queueing delay under various network topologies and settings, compared with benchmarks including the backpressure policy that maximizes network throughput and the max-link-rate policy that fully utilizes bandwidth. We further remark that the explicit min-delay policy design in multi-stage networks facilitates co-optimization with other metrics, such as minimizing total bandwidth, balancing link utilization and node buffer usage. This demonstrates the wider utility of our main results in data center network optimization in practice. ",

However, existing attempts, leveraging trajectory data for various applications have overlooked the implicit spatial-temporal dependency within trajectories and failed to encode and represent it in a format friendly to deep learning, posing a challenge in obtaining general-purpose trajectory representations. Therefore, this paper proposes a spatial-temporal joint representation learning method (ST-GraphRL) to formalize learnable spatial-temporal dependencies into trajectory representations. The proposed ST-GraphRL consists of three compositions: (i) a weighted directed spatial-temporal graph to explicitly construct mobility interactions over both space and time dimensions; (ii) a two-stage jointly encoder (i.e., decoupling and fusion) to learn entangled spatial-temporal dependencies by independently decomposing and jointly aggregating space and time information; (iii) a decoder guides ST-GraphRL to learn explicit mobility regularities by simulating the spatial-temporal distributions of trajectories. Tested on three real-world human mobility datasets, the proposed ST-GraphRL outperformed all the baseline models in predicting movement spatial-temporal distributions and preserving trajectory similarity with high spatial-temporal correlations. We also explore how spatial-temporal features presented in latent space, validating that ST-GraphRL understands spatial-temporal patterns. This method is also transferable for general-purpose geospatial data representations for broad downstream tasks, as well advancing GeoFMs developing. ",

Due to the similarity of features, boundary areas can result in mixed-up classes or clusters, leading to a crowding problem in dimensionality reduction. To address this challenge, numerous boundary point detection methods have been developed, but they are insufficiently to accurately and efficiently identify the boundary points in non-convex structures and high-dimensional manifolds. In this work, we propose a robust and efficient method for detecting boundary points using Local Direction Dispersion (LoDD). LoDD considers that internal points are surrounded by neighboring points in all directions, while neighboring points of a boundary point tend to be distributed only in a certain directional range. LoDD adopts a density-independent K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method to determine neighboring points, and defines a statistic-based metric using the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of KNN coordinates to measure the centrality of a query point. We demonstrated the validity of LoDD on five synthetic datasets (2-D and 3-D) and ten real-world benchmarks, and tested its clustering performance by equipping with two typical clustering methods, K-means and Ncut. Our results show that LoDD achieves promising and robust detection accuracy in a time-efficient manner. ",

Classical spectral clustering measures the edge weights of graph using pairwise Euclidean-based metric, and solves the optimal graph partition by relaxing the constraints of indicator matrix and performing Laplacian decomposition. However, Euclidean-based similarity might cause skew graph cuts when handling non-spherical data distributions, and the relaxation strategy introduces information loss. Meanwhile, spectral clustering requires specifying the number of clusters, which is hard to determine without enough prior knowledge. In this work, we leverage the path-based similarity to enhance intra-cluster associations, and propose MeanCut as the objective function and greedily optimize it in degree descending order for a nondestructive graph partition. This algorithm enables the identification of arbitrary shaped clusters and is robust to noise. To reduce the computational complexity of similarity calculation, we transform optimal path search into generating the maximum spanning tree (MST), and develop a fast MST (FastMST) algorithm to further improve its time-efficiency. Moreover, we define a density gradient factor (DGF) for separating the weakly connected clusters. The validity of our algorithm is demonstrated by testifying on real-world benchmarks and application of face recognition.

We observe that there is abundant semantic information such as genre, content maturity level, themes, etc. that complements co-engagement signals and provides interpretability in similarity models. To learn entity similarities from both data sources holistically, we propose a novel graph-based approach called SemanticGNN. SemanticGNN models entities, semantic concepts, collaborative edges, and semantic edges within a large-scale knowledge graph and conducts representation learning over it. Our key technical contributions are twofold: (1) we develop a novel relation-aware attention graph neural network (GNN) to handle the imbalanced distribution of relation types in our graph; (2) to handle web-scale graph data that has millions of nodes and billions of edges, we develop a novel distributed graph training paradigm. The proposed model is successfully deployed within Netflix and empirical experiments indicate it yields up to 35% improvement in performance on similarity judgment tasks. ",

The integration of fairness considerations significantly fuels interest in models and algorithms for mining fairness-aware cohesive subgraphs. Notably, the relative fair clique emerges as a robust model, ensuring not only comprehensive attribute coverage but also greater flexibility in distributing attribute vertices. Motivated by the strength of this model, we for the first time pioneer an investigation into the identification of the maximum relative fair clique in large-scale graphs. We introduce a novel concept of colorful support, which serves as the foundation for two innovative graph reduction techniques. These techniques effectively narrow the graph's size by iteratively removing edges that do not belong to relative fair cliques. Furthermore, a series of upper bounds of the maximum relative fair clique size is proposed by incorporating consideration of vertex attributes and colors. The pruning techniques derived from these upper bounds can significantly trim unnecessary search space during the branch-and-bound procedure. Adding to this, we present a heuristic algorithm with a linear time complexity, employing both a degree-based greedy strategy and a colored degree-based greedy strategy to identify a larger relative fair clique. This heuristic algorithm can serve a dual purpose by aiding in branch pruning, thereby enhancing overall search efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on six real-life datasets demonstrate the efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of our algorithms. ",

The challenge of machine unlearning is to discard information about the ``forget'' data in the learnt model without altering the knowledge about the remaining dataset and to do so more efficiently than the naive retraining approach. To achieve this, we adopt a projected-gradient based learning method, named as Projected-Gradient Unlearning (PGU), in which the model takes steps in the orthogonal direction to the gradient subspaces deemed unimportant for the retaining dataset, so as to its knowledge is preserved. By utilizing Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to update the model weights, our method can efficiently scale to any model and dataset size. We provide empirically evidence to demonstrate that our unlearning method can produce models that behave similar to models retrained from scratch across various metrics even when the training dataset is no longer accessible.

These devices interact using communication protocols like MQTT, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. However, as MIoT devices proliferate, these networked devices are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper focuses on the vulnerabilities present in the Message Queuing Telemetry and Transport (MQTT) protocol. The MQTT protocol is prone to cyber-attacks that can harm the system's functionality. The memory-constrained MIoT devices enforce a limitation on storing all data logs that are required for comprehensive network forensics. This paper solves the data log availability challenge by detecting the attack in real-time and storing the corresponding logs for further analysis with the proposed network forensics framework: MediHunt. Machine learning (ML) techniques are the most real safeguard against cyber-attacks. However, these models require a specific dataset that covers diverse attacks on the MQTT-based IoT system for training. The currently available datasets do not encompass a variety of applications and TCP layer attacks. To address this issue, we leveraged the usage of a flow-based dataset containing flow data for TCP/IP layer and application layer attacks. Six different ML models are trained with the generated dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the MediHunt framework in detecting real-time attacks. F1 scores and detection accuracy exceeded 0.99 for the proposed MediHunt framework with our custom dataset. ",

Addressing these concerns, we propose a method that leverages privacy-preserving images for reconstructing 3D head geometry within the NeRF framework. Our method stands apart from traditional facial reconstruction techniques as it does not depend on RGB information from images containing sensitive facial data.

Conventional trading mechanisms (e.g., onsite trading) confront many challenges, including decision-making overhead (e.g., latency) and potential trading failures. This paper investigates a series of cross-layer matching mechanisms to achieve stable and cost-effective resource provisioning across different layers (i.e., MUs, ESs, CSs), seamlessly integrated into a novel hybrid paradigm that incorporates futures and spot trading. In futures trading, we explore an overbooking-driven aforehand cross-layer matching (OA-CLM) mechanism, facilitating two future contract types: contract between MUs and ESs, and contract between ESs and CSs, while assessing potential risks under historical statistical analysis. In spot trading, we design two backup plans respond to current network/market conditions: determination on contractual MUs that should switch to local processing from edge/cloud services; and an onsite cross-layer matching (OS-CLM) mechanism that engages participants in real-time practical transactions. We next show that our matching mechanisms theoretically satisfy stability, individual rationality, competitive equilibrium, and weak Pareto optimality. Comprehensive simulations in real-world and numerical network settings confirm the corresponding efficacy, while revealing remarkable improvements in time/energy efficiency and social welfare. ",

    "abstract": "Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown prominent performance in semi-supervised node classification by leveraging knowledge from the graph database. However, most existing GNNs follow the homophily assumption, where connected nodes are more likely to exhibit similar feature distributions and the same labels, and such an assumption has proven to be vulnerable in a growing number of practical applications. As a supplement, heterophily reflects dissimilarity in connected nodes, which has gained significant attention in graph learning. To this end, data engineers aim to develop a powerful GNN model that can ensure performance under both homophily and heterophily. Despite numerous attempts, most existing GNNs struggle to achieve optimal node representations due to the constraints of undirected graphs. The neglect of directed edges results in sub-optimal graph representations, thereby hindering the capacity of GNNs. To address this issue, we introduce AMUD, which quantifies the relationship between node profiles and topology from a statistical perspective, offering valuable insights for \\underline{A}daptively \\underline{M}odeling the natural directed graphs as the \\underline{U}ndirected or \\underline{D}irected graph to maximize the benefits from subsequent graph learning.

The current mainstream methods still adopt reconstruction or future frame prediction techniques. However, reconstructing or predicting low-level pixel features easily enables the network to achieve overly strong generalization ability, allowing anomalies to be reconstructed or predicted as effectively as normal data. Different from their methods, inspired by the Student-Teacher Network, we propose a novel framework called the Multilevel Guidance-Exploration Network(MGENet), which detects anomalies through the difference in high-level representation between the Guidance and Exploration network. Specifically, we first utilize the pre-trained Normalizing Flow that takes skeletal keypoints as input to guide an RGB encoder, which takes unmasked RGB frames as input, to explore motion latent features. Then, the RGB encoder guides the mask encoder, which takes masked RGB frames as input, to explore the latent appearance feature. Additionally, we design a Behavior-Scene Matching Module(BSMM) to detect scene-related behavioral anomalies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ShanghaiTech and UBnormal datasets, with AUC of 86.9 % and 73.5 %, respectively.

Widely-used heuristics search for an optimal assignment of vertices based on the distance between local substructures. While faster ones only consider vertices and their incident edges, leading to poor accuracy, other approaches require computationally intense exact distance computations between subgraphs. Our new method abstracts local substructures to neighborhood trees and compares them using efficient tree matching techniques. This results in a ground distance for mapping vertices that yields high quality approximations of the graph edit distance. By limiting the maximum tree height, our method supports steering between more accurate results and faster execution. We thoroughly analyze the running time of the tree matching method and propose several techniques to accelerate computation in practice. We use compressed tree representations, recognize redundancies by tree canonization and exploit them via caching.

FL-IDS operates in a decentralized manner, enabling UAVs to collaboratively train a global intrusion detection model without sharing raw data. Local models are assigned to each UAV, using client-specific data, and only updated model weights are shared with a central server. This preserves privacy while utilizing collective intelligence for effective intrusion detection. Experimental results show FL-IDS's competitive performance with Central IDS (C-IDS) while mitigating privacy concerns. The Bias Towards Specific Clients (BTSC) method further enhances FL-IDS performance, surpassing C-IDS even at lower attacker ratios.

Recent studies in self-supervised learning have shown their potential in learning rich representations without relying on labels, yet they fall short in learning disentangled embeddings and addressing issues of inductive bias (e.g., transformation-invariance). To tackle these challenges, we propose TimeDRL, a generic multivariate time-series representation learning framework with disentangled dual-level embeddings. TimeDRL is characterized by three novel features: (i) disentangled derivation of timestamp-level and instance-level embeddings from patched time-series data using a [CLS] token strategy; (ii) utilization of timestamp-predictive and instance-contrastive tasks for disentangled representation learning, with the former optimizing timestamp-level embeddings with predictive loss, and the latter optimizing instance-level embeddings with contrastive loss; and (iii) avoidance of augmentation methods to eliminate inductive biases, such as transformation-invariance from cropping and masking. Comprehensive experiments on 6 time-series forecasting datasets and 5 time-series classification datasets have shown that TimeDRL consistently surpasses existing representation learning approaches, achieving an average improvement of forecasting by 57.98% in MSE and classification by 1.25% in accuracy. Furthermore, extensive ablation studies confirmed the relative contribution of each component in TimeDRL's architecture, and semi-supervised learning evaluations demonstrated its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, even with limited labeled data.

In human activity recognition, this pretext task employed a masking strategy centered on the time dimension.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel masking strategy called Channel Masking. It involves masking the sensor data along the channel dimension, thereby compelling the encoder to extract channel-related features while performing the masked reconstruction task. Moreover, Channel Masking can be seamlessly integrated with masking strategies along the time dimension, thereby motivating the self-supervised model to undertake the masked reconstruction task in both the time and channel dimensions. Integrated masking strategies are named Time-Channel Masking and Span-Channel Masking. Finally, we optimize the reconstruction loss function to incorporate the reconstruction loss in both the time and channel dimensions. We evaluate proposed masking strategies on three public datasets, and experimental results show that the proposed strategies outperform prior strategies in both self-supervised and semi-supervised scenarios.

However, challenges arise in this task due to photon noise inevitably introduced by photographic devices and spatial inconsistency in amplification, leading to flickering artifacts in static fields and motion blur and distortion in dynamic fields in the video. Existing methods focus on explicit motion modeling without emphasizing prioritized denoising during the motion magnification process. This paper proposes a novel dynamic filtering strategy to achieve static-dynamic field adaptive denoising. Specifically, based on Eulerian theory, we separate texture and shape to extract motion representation through inter-frame shape differences, expecting to leverage these subdivided features to solve this task finely. Then, we introduce a novel dynamic filter that eliminates noise cues and preserves critical features in the motion magnification and amplification generation phases. Overall, our unified framework, EulerMormer, is a pioneering effort to first equip with Transformer in learning-based VMM. The core of the dynamic filter lies in a global dynamic sparse cross-covariance attention mechanism that explicitly removes noise while preserving vital information, coupled with a multi-scale dual-path gating mechanism that selectively regulates the dependence on different frequency features to reduce spatial attenuation and complement motion boundaries. We demonstrate extensive experiments that EulerMormer achieves more robust video motion magnification from the Eulerian perspective, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

By assigning detected mRNA molecules to individual cells, it is possible to identify many different cell types in parallel.

However, cell typing typically depends on the segmentation of cell nuclei, which is often done based on images of a DNA stain, such as DAPI. Limiting cell definition to a nuclear stain makes it fundamentally difficult to determine accurate cell borders, and thereby also difficult to assign mRNA molecules to the correct cell. As such, we have developed a computational tool that segments cells solely based on the local composition of mRNA molecules. First, a small neural network is trained to compute attractive and repulsive edges between pairs of mRNA molecules. The signed graph is then partitioned by a mutex watershed into components corresponding to different cells. We evaluated our method on two publicly available datasets and compared it against the current state-of-the-art and older baselines.

The expected values of the soft-estimated symbols (i.e., after the linear combining and prior to the data detection) have been recently characterized for multiple user equipments (UEs) and maximum ratio combining (MRC) receiver at the base station. In this paper, we first provide a numerical evaluation of the expected value of the soft-estimated symbols with zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean squared error (MMSE) receivers for a multi-UE setting with correlated Rayleigh fading. Then, we propose a joint data detection (JD) strategy, which exploits the interdependence among the soft-estimated symbols of the interfering UEs, along with its low-complexity variant. These strategies are compared with a naive approach that adapts the maximum-likelihood data detection to the 1-bit quantization. Numerical results show that ZF and MMSE provide considerable gains over MRC in terms of symbol error rate. Moreover, the proposed JD and its low-complexity variant provide a significant boost in comparison with the single-UE data detection. ",

We will show how to change the translation, scaling, rotation, and also the shape of formation continuously by only tuning the positions of the leaders in both 2-D and 3-D spaces, where the rotation of formation in 3-D space is realized by changing the yaw angle, pitch angle, and roll angle of formation sequentially. Compared with real-Laplacian-based methods, the first advantage of the proposed complex-Laplacian-based approach is that each follower requires fewer neighbors and lesser communication. The second advantage is that non-convex and non-generic nominal configurations are allowed and the uniqueness of the complex-constraint-based target formation can be guaranteed by the non-collocated nominal agents. The third advantage is that more formation shapes can be realized by only tuning the positions of the leaders. Two simulation examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results. ",

In particular, we focus on the problem of clustering with horizontal and vertical structural constraints. Horizontal constraints are typically cannot-link and must-link among words, while vertical constraints are precedence constraints among cluster levels. We overcome state-of-the-art bottlenecks by formulating the problem in two steps: first, as a soft-constrained regularized least-squares which guides the result of a sequential graph coarsening algorithm towards the horizontal feasible set. Then, flat clusters are extracted from the resulting hierarchical tree by computing optimal cut heights based on the available constraints. We show that the resulting approach compares very well with respect to existing algorithms and is computationally light. ",

It has been long known that for real world road networks, creating a hierarchy of well-chosen shortcuts allows fast distance and path computation, with exact distance queries seemingly being answered in logarithmic time. However, these methods were but heuristics until the work of Abraham et al.~[JACM 2016], where they defined a graph parameter called highway dimension which is constant for real-world road networks, and showed that in graphs of constant highway dimension, a shortcut hierarchy exists that guarantees shortest distance computation takes $O(\\log (U+V))$ time and $O(V \\log (U+V))$ space, where $U$ is the ratio of the smallest to largest edge, and $V$ is the number of vertices. The problem is that they were unable to efficiently compute the hierarchy of shortcuts.

We propose a predictive control synthesis framework that guarantees, with high probability, the satisfaction of signal temporal logic (STL) tasks that are defined over the system and uncontrollable stochastic agents. We use trajectory predictors and conformal prediction to construct probabilistic prediction regions for each uncontrollable agent that are valid over multiple future time steps. Specifically, we reduce conservatism and increase data efficiency compared to existing works by constructing a normalized prediction region over all agents and time steps. We then formulate a worst-case mixed integer program (MIP) that accounts for all agent realizations within the prediction region to obtain control inputs that provably guarantee task satisfaction with high probability. To efficiently solve this MIP, we propose an equivalent MIP program based on KKT conditions of the original one. We illustrate our control synthesis framework on two case studies. ",

    "abstract": "Learning scene graphs from natural language descriptions has proven to be a cheap and promising scheme for Scene Graph Generation (SGG). However, such unstructured caption data and its processing are troubling the learning an acurrate and complete scene graph. This dilema can be summarized as three points. First, traditional language parsers often fail to extract meaningful relationship triplets from caption data. Second, grounding unlocalized objects in parsed triplets will meet ambiguity in visual-language alignment. Last, caption data typically are sparse and exhibit bias to partial observations of image content. These three issues make it hard for the model to generate comprehensive and accurate scene graphs. To fill this gap, we propose a simple yet effective framework, GPT4SGG, to synthesize scene graphs from holistic and region-specific narratives. The framework discards traditional language parser, and localize objects before obtaining relationship triplets. To obtain relationship triplets, holistic and dense region-specific narratives are generated from the image. With such textual representation of image data and a task-specific prompt, an LLM, particularly GPT-4, directly synthesizes a scene graph as \"pseudo labels\". Experimental results showcase GPT4SGG significantly improves the performance of SGG models trained on image-caption data.

Fortunately, the powerful generation ability of the denoising diffusion models can enable more precise measurement generation for power system data recovery. However, the controllable data generation and efficient computing methods of denoising diffusion models for deterministic trajectory still need further investigation. To this end, this paper proposes an improved two-stage denoising diffusion model (TSDM) to identify and reconstruct the measurements with various measurement uncertainties. The first stage of the model comprises a classifier-guided conditional anomaly detection component, while the second stage involves diffusion-based measurement imputation component. Moreover, the proposed TSDM adopts precise means and optimal variances to accelerate the diffusion generation process with subsequence sampling. Extensive numerical case studies demonstrate that the proposed TSDM can accurately recover power system measurements despite strong randomness under renewable energy integration and highly nonlinear dynamics under complex cyber-physical contingencies. Additionally, the proposed TSDM has stronger robustness compared to existing reconstruction networks and exhibits lower computational complexity than general denoising diffusion models. ",

We present numerous NP-complete (or even NP-hard) problems, which turn out to be easily solvable when input integers are represented in unary. We then discuss the computational complexities of such problems when taking unary-form integer inputs.

To address this, we propose a new NLP task, causal inference in natural language, inspired by the \"causal inference engine\" postulated by Judea Pearl et al. We compose a large dataset, CLadder, with 10K samples: based on a collection of causal graphs and queries (associational, interventional, and counterfactual), we obtain symbolic questions and ground-truth answers, through an oracle causal inference engine. These are then translated into natural language. We evaluate multiple LLMs on our dataset, and we introduce and evaluate a bespoke chain-of-thought prompting strategy, CausalCoT.

NeuJeans tackles the critical problem of the enormous computational cost for the FHE evaluation of convolutional layers (conv2d), mainly due to the high cost of data reordering and bootstrapping. We first propose an encoding method introducing nested structures inside encoded vectors for FHE, which enables us to develop efficient conv2d algorithms with reduced data reordering costs.

    "abstract": "The burgeoning navigation services using digital maps provide great convenience to drivers. Nevertheless, the presence of anomalies in lane rendering map images occasionally introduces potential hazards, as such anomalies can be misleading to human drivers and consequently contribute to unsafe driving conditions. In response to this concern and to accurately and effectively detect the anomalies, this paper transforms lane rendering image anomaly detection into a classification problem and proposes a four-phase pipeline consisting of data pre-processing, self-supervised pre-training with the masked image modeling (MiM) method, customized fine-tuning using cross-entropy based loss with label smoothing, and post-processing to tackle it leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, especially those involving Transformer models. Various experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline. Results indicate that the proposed pipeline exhibits superior performance in lane rendering image anomaly detection, and notably, the self-supervised pre-training with MiM can greatly enhance the detection accuracy while significantly reducing the total training time. For instance, employing the Swin Transformer with Uniform Masking as self-supervised pretraining (Swin-Trans-UM) yielded a heightened accuracy at 94.77% and an improved Area Under The Curve (AUC) score of 0.9743 compared with the pure Swin Transformer without pre-training (Swin-Trans) with an accuracy of 94.01% and an AUC of 0.9498. The fine-tuning epochs were dramatically reduced to 41 from the original 280. In conclusion, the proposed pipeline, with its incorporation of self-supervised pre-training using MiM and other advanced deep learning techniques, emerges as a robust solution for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of lane rendering image anomaly detection in digital navigation systems.

    "abstract": "Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models demonstrate impressive abilities in processing both images and text. However, they are vulnerable to multi-modal adversarial examples (AEs). Investigating the generation of high-transferability adversarial examples is crucial for uncovering VLP models' vulnerabilities in practical scenarios. Recent works have indicated that leveraging data augmentation and image-text modal interactions can enhance the transferability of adversarial examples for VLP models significantly. However, they do not consider the optimal alignment problem between dataaugmented image-text pairs. This oversight leads to adversarial examples that are overly tailored to the source model, thus limiting improvements in transferability. In our research, we first explore the interplay between image sets produced through data augmentation and their corresponding text sets. We find that augmented image samples can align optimally with certain texts while exhibiting less relevance to others. Motivated by this, we propose an Optimal Transport-based Adversarial Attack, dubbed OT-Attack. The proposed method formulates the features of image and text sets as two distinct distributions and employs optimal transport theory to determine the most efficient mapping between them. This optimal mapping informs our generation of adversarial examples to effectively counteract the overfitting issues. Extensive experiments across various network architectures and datasets in image-text matching tasks reveal that our OT-Attack outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of adversarial transferability.

    "abstract": "Automated decision systems are increasingly used to make consequential decisions in people's lives. Due to the sensitivity of the manipulated data as well as the resulting decisions, several ethical concerns need to be addressed for the appropriate use of such technologies, in particular, fairness and privacy. Unlike previous work, which focused on centralized differential privacy (DP) or local DP (LDP) for a single sensitive attribute, in this paper, we examine the impact of LDP in the presence of several sensitive attributes (i.e., multi-dimensional data) on fairness. Detailed empirical analysis on synthetic and benchmark datasets revealed very relevant observations. In particular, (1) multi-dimensional LDP is an efficient approach to reduce disparity, (2) the multi-dimensional approach of LDP (independent vs. combined) matters only at low privacy guarantees, and (3) the outcome Y distribution has an important effect on which group is more sensitive to the obfuscation. Last, we summarize our findings in the form of recommendations to guide practitioners in adopting effective privacy-preserving practices while maintaining fairness and utility in ML applications. ",

    "abstract": "Multicasting is a vital information dissemination technique in Software-Defined Networking (SDN). With SDN, a multicast service can incorporate network functions implemented at different nodes, which is referred to as software-defined multicast. Emerging ubiquitous wireless networks for 5G and Beyond (B5G) inherently support multicast. However, the broadcast nature of wireless channels, especially in dense deployments, leads to neighborhood interference as a primary system degradation factor, which introduces a new challenge for software-defined multicast in wireless mesh networks. To tackle this, this paper introduces a novel approach, based on the idea of minimizing both the total length cost of the multicast tree and the interference at the same time. Accordingly, a bicriteria optimization problem is formulated, which is called \\emph{Minimum Interference Steiner Tree (MIST)}. To solve the bicriteria problem, instead of resorting to heuristics, this paper employs an innovative approach that is an approximate algorithm for MIST but with guaranteed performance. Specifically, the approach is a two-stage relaxation algorithm by exploiting the monotone submodularity property of the interference metric and identifying Pareto optimal solutions for MIST. Simulation results demonstrate and validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. ",

Using this ontology and the extracted information, a large, scalable knowledge graph was created. Available graph storage was then leveraged to query and create datasets for further downstream tasks.

These \"Statements of Reasons\" (SoRs) are collected in the DSA Transparency Database to ensure transparency and scrutiny of content moderation decisions of the providers of online platforms. In this work, we empirically analyze 156 million SoRs within an observation period of two months to provide an early look at content moderation decisions of social media platforms in the EU. Our empirical analysis yields the following main findings: (i) There are vast differences in the frequency of content moderation across platforms. For instance, TikTok performs more than 350 times more content moderation decisions per user than X/Twitter. (ii) Content moderation is most commonly applied for text and videos, whereas images and other content formats undergo moderation less frequently. (ii) The primary reasons for moderation include content falling outside the platform's scope of service, illegal/harmful speech, and pornography/sexualized content, with moderation of misinformation being relatively uncommon. (iii) The majority of rule-breaking content is detected and decided upon via automated means rather than manual intervention. However, X/Twitter reports that it relies solely on non-automated methods. (iv) There is significant variation in the content moderation actions taken across platforms. Altogether, our study implies inconsistencies in how social media platforms implement their obligations under the DSA -- resulting in a fragmented outcome that the DSA is meant to avoid. Our findings have important implications for regulators to clarify existing guidelines or lay out more specific rules that ensure common standards on how social media providers handle rule-breaking content on their platforms.

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative learning paradigm allowing multiple clients to jointly train a model without sharing their training data. However, FL is susceptible to poisoning attacks, in which the adversary injects manipulated model updates into the federated model aggregation process to corrupt or destroy predictions (untargeted poisoning) or implant hidden functionalities (targeted poisoning or backdoors). Existing defenses against poisoning attacks in FL have several limitations, such as relying on specific assumptions about attack types and strategies or data distributions or not sufficiently robust against advanced injection techniques and strategies and simultaneously maintaining the utility of the aggregated model. To address the deficiencies of existing defenses, we take a generic and completely different approach to detect poisoning (targeted and untargeted) attacks. We present FreqFed, a novel aggregation mechanism that transforms the model updates (i.e., weights) into the frequency domain, where we can identify the core frequency components that inherit sufficient information about weights. This allows us to effectively filter out malicious updates during local training on the clients, regardless of attack types, strategies, and clients' data distributions. We extensively evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of FreqFed in different application domains, including image classification, word prediction, IoT intrusion detection, and speech recognition. We demonstrate that FreqFed can mitigate poisoning attacks effectively with a negligible impact on the utility of the aggregated model. ",

Such an embedding, serving as a unified ID representation, can not only encapsulate the characteristics of the same input ID comprehensively, but also accommodate the characteristics of different IDs for subsequent integration. This paves the way for more intriguing and practically valuable applications.

For example, consider prompting an LM to write code that counts the number of times it detects sarcasm in an essay: the LM may struggle to write an implementation for \"detect_sarcasm(string)\" that can be executed by the interpreter (handling the edge cases would be insurmountable). However, LMs may still produce a valid solution if they are used not only to write the code, but also to selectively \"emulate\" the interpreter by generating the expected output of \"detect_sarcasm(string)\" and other lines of code (e.g., that the interpreter could not compile). In this work, we propose Chain of Code (CoT), a simple yet surprisingly effective extension that improves LM code-driven reasoning. The key idea is to encourage LMs to format linguistic sub-tasks in a program as flexible pseudocode that the compiler can explicitly catch undefined behaviors and hand off to simulate with an LM (as an \"LMulator\"). Experiments demonstrate that Chain of Code outperforms Chain of Thought and other baselines across a variety of benchmarks; on BIG-Bench Hard, Chain of Code achieves 84%, a gain of 12% over Chain of Thought. CoT scales well with large and small models alike, and broadens the scope of reasoning questions that LMs can correctly answer by \"thinking in code\".

Next, a frustum-point fusion module is introduced to update per-point features hierarchically, which enables each point to extract more surrounding information via the frustum features.

Our approach, Graph Metanetworks (GMNs), generalizes to neural architectures where competing methods struggle, such as multi-head attention layers, normalization layers, convolutional layers, ResNet blocks, and group-equivariant linear layers.

The basic assumption of FL is that the devices communicate directly or indirectly with a parameter server that centrally coordinates the whole process, overcoming several challenges associated with it. However, in highly pervasive edge scenarios, the presence of a central controller that oversees the process cannot always be guaranteed, and the interactions (i.e., the connectivity graph) between devices might not be predetermined, resulting in a complex network structure. Moreover, the heterogeneity of data and devices further complicates the learning process. This poses new challenges from a learning standpoint that we address by proposing a communication-efficient Decentralised Federated Learning (DFL) algorithm able to cope with them. Our solution allows devices communicating only with their direct neighbours to train an accurate model, overcoming the heterogeneity induced by data and different training histories.

    "abstract": "Modeling spatial-temporal interactions among neighboring agents is at the heart of multi-agent problems such as motion forecasting and crowd navigation. Despite notable progress, it remains unclear to which extent modern representations can capture the causal relationships behind agent interactions. In this work, we take an in-depth look at the causal awareness of these representations, from computational formalism to real-world practice. First, we cast doubt on the notion of non-causal robustness studied in the recent CausalAgents benchmark. We show that recent representations are already partially resilient to perturbations of non-causal agents, and yet modeling indirect causal effects involving mediator agents remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a metric learning approach that regularizes latent representations with causal annotations. Our controlled experiments show that this approach not only leads to higher degrees of causal awareness but also yields stronger out-of-distribution robustness. To further operationalize it in practice, we propose a sim-to-real causal transfer method via cross-domain multi-task learning. Experiments on pedestrian datasets show that our method can substantially boost generalization, even in the absence of real-world causal annotations. We hope our work provides a new perspective on the challenges and potential pathways towards causally-aware representations of multi-agent interactions.

    "abstract": "Data shift is a phenomenon present in many real-world applications, and while there are multiple methods attempting to detect shifts, the task of localizing and correcting the features originating such shifts has not been studied in depth. Feature shifts can occur in many datasets, including in multi-sensor data, where some sensors are malfunctioning, or in tabular and structured data, including biomedical, financial, and survey data, where faulty standardization and data processing pipelines can lead to erroneous features. In this work, we explore using the principles of adversarial learning, where the information from several discriminators trained to distinguish between two distributions is used to both detect the corrupted features and fix them in order to remove the distribution shift between datasets. We show that mainstream supervised classifiers, such as random forest or gradient boosting trees, combined with simple iterative heuristics, can localize and correct feature shifts, outperforming current statistical and neural network-based techniques.

    "abstract": "In this work, we present Digital Life Project, a framework utilizing language as the universal medium to build autonomous 3D characters, who are capable of engaging in social interactions and expressing with articulated body motions, thereby simulating life in a digital environment. Our framework comprises two primary components: 1) SocioMind: a meticulously crafted digital brain that models personalities with systematic few-shot exemplars, incorporates a reflection process based on psychology principles, and emulates autonomy by initiating dialogue topics; 2) MoMat-MoGen: a text-driven motion synthesis paradigm for controlling the character's digital body. It integrates motion matching, a proven industry technique to ensure motion quality, with cutting-edge advancements in motion generation for diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that each module achieves state-of-the-art performance in its respective domain. Collectively, they enable virtual characters to initiate and sustain dialogues autonomously, while evolving their socio-psychological states. Concurrently, these characters can perform contextually relevant bodily movements. Additionally, a motion captioning module further allows the virtual character to recognize and appropriately respond to human players' actions. Homepage: https://digital-life-project.com/ ",

Similar to Zero-1-to-3, we start from a pre-trained 2D image generator for generalization, and fine-tune it for NVS. Compared to recent and concurrent works, we obtain significant improvements without resorting to an explicit 3D representation, which is slow and memory-consuming or training an additional 3D network. We do so by encoding better the target camera pose via a new per-pixel ray conditioning normalization (RCN) layer. The latter injects pose information in the underlying 2D image generator by telling each pixel its specific viewing direction. We also improve multi-view consistency via a light-weight multi-view attention layer and multi-view noise sharing. We train Free3D on the Objaverse dataset and demonstrate excellent generalization to various new categories in several new datasets, including OminiObject3D and GSO. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help future research in NVS with more accuracy pose. The project page is available at https://chuanxiaz.com/free3d/. ",

The GGM structure is encoded in its precision (inverse covariance) matrix. In many applications one is interested in estimating the difference in two precision matrices to characterize underlying changes in conditional dependencies of two sets of data. Existing methods for differential graph estimation are based on single-attribute (SA) models where one associates a scalar random variable with each node. In multi-attribute (MA) graphical models, each node represents a random vector. In this paper, we analyze a group lasso penalized D-trace loss function approach for differential graph learning from multi-attribute data. An alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is presented to optimize the objective function. Theoretical analysis establishing consistency in support recovery and estimation in high-dimensional settings is provided. Numerical results based on synthetic as well as real data are presented. ",

    "abstract": "The identification of essential proteins in protein-protein interaction networks (PINs) can help to discover drug targets and prevent disease. In order to improve the accuracy of the identification of essential proteins, researchers attempted to obtain a refined PIN by combining multiple biological information to filter out some unreliable interactions in the PIN. Unfortunately, such approaches drastically reduce the number of nodes in the PIN after multiple refinements and result in a sparser PIN. It makes a considerable portion of essential proteins unidentifiable. In this paper, we propose a multi-layer refined network (MR-PIN) that addresses this problem. Firstly, four refined networks are constructed by respectively integrating different biological information into the static PIN to form a multi-layer heterogeneous network. Then scores of proteins in each network layer are calculated by the existing node ranking method, and the importance score of a protein in the MR-PIN is evaluated in terms of the geometric mean of its scores in all layers. Finally, all nodes are sorted by their importance scores to determine their essentiality. To evaluate the effectiveness of the multi-layer refined network model, we apply 16 node ranking methods on the MR-PIN, and compare the results with those on the SPIN, DPIN and RDPIN. Then the predictive performances of these ranking methods are validated in terms of the identification number of essential protein at top100 - top600, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, F-measure, accuracy, Jackknife, ROCAUC and PRAUC. The experimental results show that the MR-PIN is superior to the existing refined PINs in the identification accuracy of essential proteins. ",

To address the first two issues, we introduce a new framework and open-source software nbi (Neural Bayesian Inference), which supports both amortized and sequential NPE. First, nbi provides built-in \"featurizer\" networks with demonstrated efficacy on sequential data, such as light curve and spectra, thus obviating the need for this customization on the user end. Second, we introduce a modified algorithm SNPE-IS, which facilities asymptotically exact inference by using the surrogate posterior under NPE only as a proposal distribution for importance sampling. These features allow nbi to be applied off-the-shelf to astronomical inference problems involving light curves and spectra. We discuss how nbi may serve as an effective alternative to existing methods such as Nested Sampling. Our package is at https://github.com/kmzzhang/nbi. ",

We developed and implemented a multiple-input, single-output (MISO) framework comprising two deep neural network (DNN) models, predicting key process performance indicators. These models were then integrated into an optimization framework, leveraging particle swarm optimization (PSO) and statistical analysis to generate a comprehensive Pareto front representation. This approach delineated feasible operational regions (FORs) and highlighted the spectrum of optimal decision-making scenarios. A key aspect of our methodology was the evaluation of optimization effectiveness. This was accomplished by testing decision variables derived from the Pareto front against a phenomenological model, affirming the surrogate models reliability. Subsequently, the study delved into analyzing the feasible operational domains of these decision variables. A detailed correlation map was constructed to elucidate the interplay between these variables, thereby uncovering the most impactful factors influencing process behavior. The study offers a practical, insightful operational map that aids operators in pinpointing the optimal process location and prioritizing specific operational goals. ",

    "abstract": "Weather forecasting is a fundamental problem for anticipating and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recently, data-driven approaches for weather forecasting based on deep learning have shown great promise, achieving accuracies that are competitive with operational systems. However, those methods often employ complex, customized architectures without sufficient ablation analysis, making it difficult to understand what truly contributes to their success. Here we introduce Stormer, a simple transformer model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on weather forecasting with minimal changes to the standard transformer backbone. We identify the key components of Stormer through careful empirical analyses, including weather-specific embedding, randomized dynamics forecast, and pressure-weighted loss. At the core of Stormer is a randomized forecasting objective that trains the model to forecast the weather dynamics over varying time intervals. During inference, this allows us to produce multiple forecasts for a target lead time and combine them to obtain better forecast accuracy. On WeatherBench 2, Stormer performs competitively at short to medium-range forecasts and outperforms current methods beyond 7 days, while requiring orders-of-magnitude less training data and compute. Additionally, we demonstrate Stormer's favorable scaling properties, showing consistent improvements in forecast accuracy with increases in model size and training tokens. Code and checkpoints will be made publicly available. ",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted a profound impact on the global economy and continues to exact a significant toll on human lives. The COVID-19 case growth rate stands as a key epidemiological parameter to estimate and monitor for effective detection and containment of the resurgence of outbreaks. A fundamental challenge in growth rate estimation and hence outbreak detection is balancing the accuracy-speed tradeoff, where accuracy typically degrades with shorter fitting windows. In this paper, we develop a machine learning (ML) algorithm, which we call Transfer Learning Generalized Random Forest (TLGRF), that balances this accuracy-speed tradeoff. Specifically, we estimate the instantaneous COVID-19 exponential growth rate for each U.S. county by using TLGRF that chooses an adaptive fitting window size based on relevant day-level and county-level features affecting the disease spread. Through transfer learning, TLGRF can accurately estimate case growth rates for counties with small sample sizes. Out-of-sample prediction analysis shows that TLGRF outperforms established growth rate estimation methods. Furthermore, we conducted a case study based on outbreak case data from the state of Colorado and showed that the timely detection of outbreaks could have been improved by up to 224% using TLGRF when compared to the decisions made by Colorado's Department of Health and Environment (CDPHE). To facilitate implementation, we have developed a publicly available outbreak detection tool for timely detection of COVID-19 outbreaks in each U.S. county, which received substantial attention from policymakers.

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection in Brain MRIs aims to identify abnormalities as outliers from a healthy training distribution. Reconstruction-based approaches that use generative models to learn to reconstruct healthy brain anatomy are commonly used for this task. Diffusion models are an emerging class of deep generative models that show great potential regarding reconstruction fidelity. However, they face challenges in preserving intensity characteristics in the reconstructed images, limiting their performance in anomaly detection. To address this challenge, we propose to condition the denoising mechanism of diffusion models with additional information about the image to reconstruct coming from a latent representation of the noise-free input image. This conditioning enables high-fidelity reconstruction of healthy brain structures while aligning local intensity characteristics of input-reconstruction pairs. We evaluate our method's reconstruction quality, domain adaptation features and finally segmentation performance on publicly available data sets with various pathologies. Using our proposed conditioning mechanism we can reduce the false-positive predictions and enable a more precise delineation of anomalies which significantly enhances the anomaly detection performance compared to established state-of-the-art approaches to unsupervised anomaly detection in brain MRI. Furthermore, our approach shows promise in domain adaptation across different MRI acquisitions and simulated contrasts, a crucial property of general anomaly detection methods. ",

Data heterogeneity is one of the core challenges in federated learning, which could severely degrade the convergence rate and prediction performance of deep neural networks. To address this issue, we develop a novel personalized federated learning framework for heterogeneous data, which we refer to as FedSplit. This modeling framework is motivated by the finding that, data in different clients contain both common knowledge and personalized knowledge. Then the hidden elements in each neural layer can be split into the shared and personalized groups. With this decomposition, a novel objective function is established and optimized. We demonstrate FedSplit enjoyers a faster convergence speed than the standard federated learning method both theoretically and empirically. The generalization bound of the FedSplit method is also studied. To practically implement the proposed method on real datasets, factor analysis is introduced to facilitate the decoupling of hidden elements. This leads to a practically implemented model for FedSplit and we further refer to as FedFac. We demonstrated by simulation studies that, using factor analysis can well recover the underlying shared/personalized decomposition. The superior prediction performance of FedFac is further verified empirically by comparison with various state-of-the-art federated learning methods on several real datasets. ",

We apply ADDM to anomaly detection in unsupervised MRI images. Experimental results show that the proposed ADDM outperformed existing generative model-based unsupervised anomaly detection methods.
