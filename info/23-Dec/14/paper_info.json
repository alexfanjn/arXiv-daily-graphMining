    "abstract": "Audit logs containing system level events are frequently used for behavior modeling as they can provide detailed insight into cyber-threat occurrences. However, mapping low-level system events in audit logs to highlevel behaviors has been a major challenge in identifying host contextual behavior for the purpose of detecting potential cyber threats. Relying on domain expert knowledge may limit its practical implementation. This paper presents TapTree, an automated process-tree based technique to extract host behavior by compiling system events' semantic information. After extracting behaviors as system generated process trees, TapTree integrates event semantics as a representation of behaviors. To further reduce pattern matching workloads for the analyst, TapTree aggregates semantically equivalent patterns and optimizes representative behaviors. In our evaluation against a recent benchmark audit log dataset (DARPA OpTC), TapTree employs tree pattern queries and sequential pattern mining techniques to deduce the semantics of connected system events, achieving high accuracy for behavior abstraction and then Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attack detection. Moreover, we illustrate how to update the baseline model gradually online, allowing it to adapt to new log patterns over time. ",

    "abstract": "Gland instance segmentation is an essential but challenging task in the diagnosis and treatment of adenocarcinoma. The existing models usually achieve gland instance segmentation through multi-task learning and boundary loss constraint. However, how to deal with the problems of gland adhesion and inaccurate boundary in segmenting the complex samples remains a challenge. In this work, we propose a displacement-field assisted graph energy transmitter (DFGET) framework to solve these problems. Specifically, a novel message passing manner based on anisotropic diffusion is developed to update the node features, which can distinguish the isomorphic graphs and improve the expressivity of graph nodes for complex samples. Using such graph framework, the gland semantic segmentation map and the displacement field (DF) of the graph nodes are estimated with two graph network branches. With the constraint of DF, a graph cluster module based on diffusion theory is presented to improve the intra-class feature consistency and inter-class feature discrepancy, as well as to separate the adherent glands from the semantic segmentation maps. Extensive comparison and ablation experiments on the GlaS dataset demonstrate the superiority of DFGET and effectiveness of the proposed anisotropic message passing manner and clustering method. Compared to the best comparative model, DFGET increases the object-Dice and object-F1 score by 2.5% and 3.4% respectively, while decreases the object-HD by 32.4%, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

    "abstract": "Knowledge graphs generally suffer from incompleteness, which can be alleviated by completing the missing information. Deep knowledge convolutional embedding models based on neural networks are currently popular methods for knowledge graph completion. However, most existing methods use external convolution kernels and traditional plain convolution processes, which limits the feature interaction capability of the model. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic convolutional embedding model ConvD for knowledge graph completion, which directly reshapes the relation embeddings into multiple internal convolution kernels to improve the external convolution kernels of the traditional convolutional embedding model. The internal convolution kernels can effectively augment the feature interaction between the relation embeddings and entity embeddings, thus enhancing the model embedding performance. Moreover, we design a priori knowledge-optimized attention mechanism, which can assign different contribution weight coefficients to multiple relation convolution kernels for dynamic convolution to improve the expressiveness of the model further. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our proposed model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods, with average improvements ranging from 11.30\\% to 16.92\\% across all model evaluation metrics. Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of each component module of the ConvD model. ",

Given the evolution of hardware attacks, which can render them vulnerable, it is essential to consider security as a significant aspect of the HLS design flow. Yet the need to evaluate a huge number of functionally equivalent de-signs of the HLS design space challenges hardware security evaluation methods (e.g., fault injection - FI campaigns). In this work, we propose an evaluation methodology of hardware security properties of HLS-produced designs using state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network (GNN) approaches that achieves significant speedup and better scalability than typical evaluation methods (such as FI). We demonstrate the proposed methodology on a Double Modular Redundancy (DMR) coun-termeasure applied on an AES SBox implementation, en-hanced by diversifying the redundant modules through HLS directives. The experimental results show that GNNs can be efficiently trained to predict important hardware security met-rics concerning fault attacks (e.g., critical and detection error rates), by using regression. The proposed method predicts the fault vulnerability metrics of the HLS-based designs with high R-squared scores and achieves huge speedup compared to fault injection once the training of the GNN is completed.

    "abstract": "X (formerly Twitter) has evolved into a contemporary agora, offering a platform for individuals to express opinions and viewpoints on current events. The majority of the topics discussed on Twitter are directly related to ongoing events, making it an important source for monitoring public discourse. However, linking tweets to specific news presents a significant challenge due to their concise and informal nature. Previous approaches, including topic models, graph-based models, and supervised classifiers, have fallen short in effectively capturing the unique characteristics of tweets and articles. Inspired by the success of the CLIP model in computer vision, which employs contrastive learning to model similarities between images and captions, this paper introduces a contrastive learning approach for training a representation space where linked articles and tweets exhibit proximity. We present our contrastive learning approach, CATBERT (Contrastive Articles Tweets BERT), leveraging pre-trained BERT models. The model is trained and tested on a dataset containing manually labeled English and Polish tweets and articles related to the Russian-Ukrainian war. We evaluate CATBERT's performance against traditional approaches like LDA, and the novel method based on OpenAI embeddings, which has not been previously applied to this task. Our findings indicate that CATBERT demonstrates superior performance in associating tweets with relevant news articles. Furthermore, we demonstrate the performance of the models when applied to finding the main topic -- represented by an article -- of the whole cascade of tweets. In this new task, we report the performance of the different models in dependence on the cascade size. ",

In this thesis, we present a series of frameworks for dynamic scene understanding starting from road event detection from an autonomous driving perspective to complex video activity detection, followed by continual learning approaches for the life-long learning of the models. Firstly, we introduce the ROad event Awareness Dataset (ROAD) for Autonomous Driving, to our knowledge the first of its kind. Due to the lack of datasets equipped with formally specified logical requirements, we also introduce the ROad event Awareness Dataset with logical Requirements (ROAD-R), the first publicly available dataset for autonomous driving with requirements expressed as logical constraints, as a tool for driving neurosymbolic research in the area. Next, we extend event detection to holistic scene understanding by proposing two complex activity detection methods. In the first method, we present a deformable, spatiotemporal scene graph approach, consisting of three main building blocks: action tube detection, a 3D deformable RoI pooling layer designed for learning the flexible, deformable geometry of the constituent action tubes, and a scene graph constructed by considering all parts as nodes and connecting them based on different semantics. In a second approach evolving from the first, we propose a hybrid graph neural network that combines attention applied to a graph encoding of the local (short-term) dynamic scene with a temporal graph modelling the overall long-duration activity. Finally, the last part of the thesis is about presenting a new continual semi-supervised learning (CSSL) paradigm. ",

These cells regulate neural activity through tripartite synapses, directly impacting cognitive processes such as learning and memory. Despite the growing recognition of astrocytes' significance, traditional Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models remain predominantly neuron-centric, overlooking the profound influence of astrocytes on neural dynamics. Inspired by these biological insights, we have developed an Astrocyte-Modulated Spiking Unit (AM-SU), an innovative framework that integrates neuron-astrocyte interactions into the computational paradigm, demonstrating wide applicability across various hardware platforms. Our Astrocyte-Modulated Spiking Neural Network (AM-SNet) exhibits exceptional performance in tasks involving memory retention and natural language generation, particularly in handling long-term dependencies and complex linguistic structures. The design of AM-SNet not only enhances its biological authenticity but also introduces novel computational dynamics, enabling more effective processing of complex temporal dependencies. Furthermore, AM-SNet shows low latency, high throughput, and reduced memory usage in practical applications, making it highly suitable for resource-constrained environments. By successfully integrating astrocytic dynamics into intelligent neural networks, our work narrows the gap between biological plausibility and neural modeling, laying the groundwork for future biologically-inspired neural computing research that includes both neurons and astrocytes.

As our main technical contribution, we establish the tractability of computing a welfare-maximizing partitioning of the agents into coalitions on tree-like networks, for every score-based function $u^s$. We provide more efficient algorithms when dealing with specific choices of $u^s$ or simpler networks, and also extend all of these results to computing coalitions that are Nash stable or individually rational. We view these results as a further strong indication of the usefulness of the proposed score-based utility function: even on very simple networks, the problem of computing a welfare-maximizing partitioning into coalitions remains open for the originally considered canonical function $u$.

    "abstract": "In this study, we present a novel computational method for generating molecular fingerprints using multiparameter persistent homology (MPPH). This technique holds considerable significance for drug discovery and materials science, where precise molecular property prediction is vital. By integrating SE(3)-invariance with Vietoris-Rips persistent homology, we effectively capture the three-dimensional representations of molecular chirality. This non-superimposable mirror image property directly influences the molecular interactions, serving as an essential factor in molecular property prediction. We explore the underlying topologies and patterns in molecular structures by applying Vietoris-Rips persistent homology across varying scales and parameters such as atomic weight, partial charge, bond type, and chirality. Our method's efficacy can be improved by incorporating additional parameters such as aromaticity, orbital hybridization, bond polarity, conjugated systems, as well as bond and torsion angles. Additionally, we leverage Stochastic Gradient Langevin Boosting in a Bayesian ensemble of GBDTs to obtain aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty estimates for gradient boosting models. With these uncertainty estimates, we prioritize high-uncertainty samples for active learning and model fine-tuning, benefiting scenarios where data labeling is costly or time consuming. Compared to conventional GNNs which usually suffer from oversmoothing and oversquashing, MPPH provides a more comprehensive and interpretable characterization of molecular data topology. We substantiate our approach with theoretical stability guarantees and demonstrate its superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods in predicting molecular properties through extensive evaluations on the MoleculeNet benchmark datasets.

This paper presents an optimal strategy for streaming contexts with limited labeled data, introducing an adaptive technique for unsupervised regression.

To enhance adaptability, we integrate the ADWIN (ADaptive WINdowing) algorithm with error generalization based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). ADWIN facilitates real-time drift detection, while RMSE provides a robust measure of model prediction accuracy. This combination enables our multivariate method to effectively navigate the challenges of streaming data, continuously adapting to changing patterns while maintaining a high level of predictive precision. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our multivariate method across various public datasets, comparing it to non-adapting baselines. Through comprehensive assessments, we demonstrate the superior efficacy of our adaptive regression technique for tasks where obtaining labels in real-time is a significant challenge. The results underscore the method's capacity to outperform traditional approaches and highlight its potential in scenarios characterized by label scarcity and evolving data patterns. ",

    "abstract": "We study the incentives behind double-spend attacks on Nakamoto-style Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies. In these systems, miners are allowed to choose which transactions to reference with their block, and a common strategy for selecting transactions is to simply choose those with the highest fees. This can be problematic if these transactions originate from an adversary with substantial (but less than 50\\%) computational power, as high-value transactions can present an incentive for a rational adversary to attempt a double-spend attack if they expect to profit. The most common mechanism for deterring double-spend attacks is for the recipients of large transactions to wait for additional block confirmations (i.e., to increase the attack cost). We argue that this defense mechanism is not satisfactory, as the security of the system is contingent on the actions of its users. Instead, we propose that defending against double-spend attacks should be the responsibility of the miners; specifically, miners should limit the amount of transaction value they include in a block (i.e., reduce the attack reward). To this end, we model cryptocurrency mining as a mean-field game in which we augment the standard mining reward function to simulate the presence of a rational, double-spending adversary. We design and implement an algorithm which characterizes the behavior of miners at equilibrium, and we show that miners who use the adversary-aware reward function accumulate more wealth than those who do not. We show that the optimal strategy for honest miners is to limit the amount of value transferred by each block such that the adversary's expected profit is 0. Additionally, we examine Bitcoin's resilience to double-spend attacks. Assuming a 6 block confirmation time, we find that an attacker with at least 25% of the network mining power can expect to profit from a double-spend attack. ",

    "abstract": "Group Activity Scene Graph (GASG) generation is a challenging task in computer vision, aiming to anticipate and describe relationships between subjects and objects in video sequences. Traditional Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) methods focus on retrospective analysis, limiting their predictive capabilities. To enrich the scene understanding capabilities, we introduced a GASG dataset extending the JRDB dataset with nuanced annotations involving \\textit{Appearance, Interaction, Position, Relationship, and Situation} attributes. This work also introduces an innovative approach, \\textbf{H}ierarchical \\textbf{Att}ention-\\textbf{Flow} (HAtt-Flow) Mechanism, rooted in flow network theory to enhance GASG performance. Flow-Attention incorporates flow conservation principles, fostering competition for sources and allocation for sinks, effectively preventing the generation of trivial attention. Our proposed approach offers a unique perspective on attention mechanisms, where conventional \"values\" and \"keys\" are transformed into sources and sinks, respectively, creating a novel framework for attention-based models. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our Hatt-Flow model and the superiority of our proposed Flow-Attention mechanism. This work represents a significant advancement in predictive video scene understanding, providing valuable insights and techniques for applications that require real-time relationship prediction in video data.

    "abstract": "HPC-based applications often have complex workflows with many software dependencies that hinder their portability on contemporary HPC architectures. In addition, these applications often require extraordinary efforts to deploy and execute at performance potential on new HPC systems, while the users expert in these applications generally have less expertise in HPC and related technologies. This paper provides a dynamic solution that facilitates containerization for transferring HPC software onto diverse parallel systems. The study relies on the HPC Workflow as a Service (HPCWaaS) paradigm proposed by the EuroHPC eFlows4HPC project. It offers to deploy workflows through containers tailored for any of a number of specific HPC systems. Traditional container image creation tools rely on OS system packages compiled for generic architecture families (x86\\_64, amd64, ppc64, ...) and specific MPI or GPU runtime library versions. The containerization solution proposed in this paper leverages HPC Builders such as Spack or Easybuild and multi-platform builders such as buildx to create a service for automating the creation of container images for the software specific to each hardware architecture, aiming to sustain the overall performance of the software. We assess the efficiency of our proposed solution for porting the geostatistics ExaGeoStat software on various parallel systems while preserving the computational performance. The results show that the performance of the generated images is comparable with the native execution of the software on the same architectures. On the distributed-memory system, the containerized version can scale up to 256 nodes without impacting performance. ",

However, recent studies have revealed that self-attention, a key component of Transformers, can lead to an oversmoothing issue. We show that Transformers for tabular data also face this problem, and to address the problem, we propose a novel matrix polynomial-based self-attention layer as a substitute for the original self-attention layer, which enhances model scalability. In our experiments with three representative table learning models equipped with our proposed layer, we illustrate that the layer effectively mitigates the oversmoothing problem and enhances the representation performance of the existing methods, outperforming the state-of-the-art table representation methods.

    "abstract": "Compressing large neural networks with minimal performance loss is crucial to enabling their deployment on edge devices. (Cho et al., 2022) proposed a weight quantization method that uses an attention-based clustering algorithm called differentiable $k$-means (DKM). Despite achieving state-of-the-art results, DKM's performance is constrained by its heavy memory dependency. We propose an implicit, differentiable $k$-means algorithm (IDKM), which eliminates the major memory restriction of DKM. Let $t$ be the number of $k$-means iterations, $m$ be the number of weight-vectors, and $b$ be the number of bits per cluster address. IDKM reduces the overall memory complexity of a single $k$-means layer from $\\mathcal{O}(t \\cdot m \\cdot 2^b)$ to $\\mathcal{O}( m \\cdot 2^b)$. We also introduce a variant, IDKM with Jacobian-Free-Backpropagation (IDKM-JFB), for which the time complexity of the gradient calculation is independent of $t$ as well. We provide a proof of concept of our methods by showing that, under the same settings, IDKM achieves comparable performance to DKM with less compute time and less memory. We also use IDKM and IDKM-JFB to quantize a large neural network, Resnet18, on hardware where DKM cannot train at all. ",

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to automate the design of these complex architectures, reducing the need for costly manual design work by human experts. Cellular Encoding (CE) is an evolutionary computation technique which excels in constructing novel multi-path topologies of varying complexity and has recently been applied with NAS to evolve CNN architectures for various classification tasks. However, existing CE approaches have severe limitations. They are restricted to only one domain, only partially implement the theme of CE, or only focus on the micro-architecture search space. This paper introduces a new CE representation and algorithm capable of evolving novel multi-path CNN architectures of varying depth, width, and complexity for image and text classification tasks. The algorithm explicitly focuses on the macro-architecture search space. Furthermore, by using a surrogate model approach, we show that the algorithm can evolve a performant CNN architecture in less than one GPU day, thereby allowing a sufficient number of experiment runs to be conducted to achieve scientific robustness. Experiment results show that the approach is highly competitive, defeating several state-of-the-art methods, and is generalisable to both the image and text domains. ",

A large number of companies base their businesses on building products that use neural networks for tasks such as face recognition, machine translation, and autonomous cars. They are being used in safety and security-critical applications like high definition maps and medical wristbands, or in globally used products like Google Translate and ChatGPT. Much of the intellectual property underpinning these products is encoded in the exact configuration of the neural networks. Consequently, protecting these is of utmost priority to businesses. At the same time, many of these products need to operate under a strong threat model, in which the adversary has unfettered physical control of the product. Past work has demonstrated that with physical access, attackers can reverse engineer neural networks that run on scalar microcontrollers, like ARM Cortex M3. However, for performance reasons, neural networks are often implemented on highly-parallel general purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs), and so far, attacks on these have only recovered course-grained information on the structure of the neural network, but failed to retrieve the weights and biases. In this work, we present BarraCUDA, a novel attack on GPGPUs that can completely extract the parameters of neural networks. BarraCUDA uses correlation electromagnetic analysis to recover the weights and biases in the convolutional layers of neural networks. We use BarraCUDA to attack the popular NVIDIA Jetson Nano device, demonstrating successful parameter extraction of neural networks in a highly parallel and noisy environment. ",

An embedding attempts to map data tokens to a low-dimensional space where similar tokens are mapped to vectors that are close to one another by some metric in the embedding space. A basic question is how well can such embedding be learned? To study this problem, we consider a simple probability model for discrete data where there is some \"true\" but unknown embedding where the correlation of random variables is related to the similarity of the embeddings. Under this model, it is shown that the embeddings can be learned by a variant of low-rank approximate message passing (AMP) method. The AMP approach enables precise predictions of the accuracy of the estimation in certain high-dimensional limits. In particular, the methodology provides insight on the relations of key parameters such as the number of samples per value, the frequency of the terms, and the strength of the embedding correlation on the probability distribution. Our theoretical findings are validated by simulations on both synthetic data and real text data. ",

We experimented with lightweight baseline models by freezing PhoBERT and XLM-RoBERTa and using their hidden states in a BiLSTM to assess the complexity of the dataset.

We address beam scheduling for tracking multiple smart targets in phased array radar networks. We aim to mitigate the performance degradation in previous myopic tracking methods and enhance the system performance, which is measured by a discounted cost objective related to the tracking error covariance (TEC) of the targets. The scheduling problem is formulated as a restless multi-armed bandit problem (RMABP) with state variables, following the Markov decision process. In particular, the problem consists of parallel bandit processes. Each bandit process is associated with a target and evolves with different transition rules for different actions, i.e., either the target is tracked or not. We propose a non-myopic, scalable policy based on Whittle indices for selecting the targets to be tracked at each time. The proposed policy has a linear computational complexity in the number of targets and the truncated time horizon in the index computation, and is hence applicable to large networks with a realistic number of targets. We present numerical evidence that the model satisfies sufficient conditions for indexability (existence of the Whittle index) based upon partial conservation laws, and, through extensive simulations, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed policy in different scenarios.

    "abstract": "Rationale discovery is defined as finding a subset of the input data that maximally supports the prediction of downstream tasks. In graph machine learning context, graph rationale is defined to locate the critical subgraph in the given graph topology, which fundamentally determines the prediction results. In contrast to the rationale subgraph, the remaining subgraph is named the environment subgraph. Graph rationalization can enhance the model performance as the mapping between the graph rationale and prediction label is viewed as invariant, by assumption. To ensure the discriminative power of the extracted rationale subgraphs, a key technique named \"intervention\" is applied. The core idea of intervention is that given any changing environment subgraphs, the semantics from the rationale subgraph is invariant, which guarantees the correct prediction result. However, most, if not all, of the existing rationalization works on graph data develop their intervention strategies on the graph level, which is coarse-grained. In this paper, we propose well-tailored intervention strategies on graph data. Our idea is driven by the development of Transformer models, whose self-attention module provides rich interactions between input nodes. Based on the self-attention module, our proposed invariant graph Transformer (IGT) can achieve fine-grained, more specifically, node-level and virtual node-level intervention. Our comprehensive experiments involve 7 real-world datasets, and the proposed IGT shows significant performance advantages compared to 13 baseline methods. ",

    "abstract": "The emergence of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in graph data analysis and their deployment on Machine Learning as a Service platforms have raised critical concerns about data misuse during model training. This situation is further exacerbated due to the lack of transparency in local training processes, potentially leading to the unauthorized accumulation of large volumes of graph data, thereby infringing on the intellectual property rights of data owners. Existing methodologies often address either data misuse detection or mitigation, and are primarily designed for local GNN models rather than cloud-based MLaaS platforms. These limitations call for an effective and comprehensive solution that detects and mitigates data misuse without requiring exact training data while respecting the proprietary nature of such data. This paper introduces a pioneering approach called GraphGuard, to tackle these challenges. We propose a training-data-free method that not only detects graph data misuse but also mitigates its impact via targeted unlearning, all without relying on the original training data. Our innovative misuse detection technique employs membership inference with radioactive data, enhancing the distinguishability between member and non-member data distributions. For mitigation, we utilize synthetic graphs that emulate the characteristics previously learned by the target model, enabling effective unlearning even in the absence of exact graph data. We conduct comprehensive experiments utilizing four real-world graph datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of GraphGuard in both detection and unlearning. We show that GraphGuard attains a near-perfect detection rate of approximately 100% across these datasets with various GNN models. In addition, it performs unlearning by eliminating the impact of the unlearned graph with a marginal decrease in accuracy (less than 5%). ",

Even with considerable efforts spent on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), recent studies have shown that LLMs are still subject to attacks such as adversarial perturbation and Trojan attacks. Further research is thus needed to evaluate their security and/or understand the lack of it. In this work, we propose a framework for conducting light-weight causality-analysis of LLMs at the token, layer, and neuron level. We applied our framework to open-source LLMs such as Llama2 and Vicuna and had multiple interesting discoveries. Based on a layer-level causality analysis, we show that RLHF has the effect of overfitting a model to harmful prompts. It implies that such security can be easily overcome by `unusual' harmful prompts. As evidence, we propose an adversarial perturbation method that achieves 100\\% attack success rate on the red-teaming tasks of the Trojan Detection Competition 2023. Furthermore, we show the existence of one mysterious neuron in both Llama2 and Vicuna that has an unreasonably high causal effect on the output. While we are uncertain on why such a neuron exists, we show that it is possible to conduct a ``Trojan'' attack targeting that particular neuron to completely cripple the LLM, i.e., we can generate transferable suffixes to prompts that frequently make the LLM produce meaningless responses.

In practice, using a brute-force attack to discover vulnerabilities is infeasible due to the wide variety of attack patterns. Thus, various black-box testing techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, these techniques suffer from low efficiency. This paper presents Reinforcement-Learning-Driven and Adaptive Testing (RAT), an automated black-box testing strategy to discover injection vulnerabilities in WAFs. In particular, we focus on SQL injection and Cross-site Scripting, which have been among the top ten vulnerabilities over the past decade. More specifically, RAT clusters similar attack samples together. It then utilizes a reinforcement learning technique combined with a novel adaptive search algorithm to discover almost all bypassing attack patterns efficiently. We compare RAT with three state-of-the-art methods considering their objectives. The experiments show that RAT performs 33.53% and 63.16% on average better than its counterparts in discovering the most possible bypassing payloads and reducing the number of attempts before finding the first bypassing payload when testing well-configured WAFs, respectively.

    "abstract": "A timely software update is vital to combat the increasing security vulnerabilities. However, some software vendors may secretly patch their vulnerabilities without creating CVE entries or even describing the security issue in their change log. Thus, it is critical to identify these hidden security patches and defeat potential N-day attacks. Researchers have employed various machine learning techniques to identify security patches in open-source software, leveraging the syntax and semantic features of the software changes and commit messages. However, all these solutions cannot be directly applied to the binary code, whose instructions and program flow may dramatically vary due to different compilation configurations. In this paper, we propose BinGo, a new security patch detection system for binary code. The main idea is to present the binary code as code property graphs to enable a comprehensive understanding of program flow and perform a language model over each basic block of binary code to catch the instruction semantics. BinGo consists of four phases, namely, patch data pre-processing, graph extraction, embedding generation, and graph representation learning. Due to the lack of an existing binary security patch dataset, we construct such a dataset by compiling the pre-patch and post-patch source code of the Linux kernel. Our experimental results show BinGo can achieve up to 80.77% accuracy in identifying security patches between two neighboring versions of binary code. Moreover, BinGo can effectively reduce the false positives and false negatives caused by the different compilers and optimization levels. ",

    "abstract": "Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are potential competitors to artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to their high energy-efficiency on neuromorphic hardware. However, SNNs are unfolded over simulation time steps during the training process. Thus, SNNs require much more memory than ANNs, which impedes the training of deeper SNN models. In this paper, we propose the reversible spiking neural network to reduce the memory cost of intermediate activations and membrane potentials during training. Firstly, we extend the reversible architecture along temporal dimension and propose the reversible spiking block, which can reconstruct the computational graph and recompute all intermediate variables in forward pass with a reverse process. On this basis, we adopt the state-of-the-art SNN models to the reversible variants, namely reversible spiking ResNet (RevSResNet) and reversible spiking transformer (RevSFormer). Through experiments on static and neuromorphic datasets, we demonstrate that the memory cost per image of our reversible SNNs does not increase with the network depth. On CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, our RevSResNet37 and RevSFormer-4-384 achieve comparable accuracies and consume 3.79x and 3.00x lower GPU memory per image than their counterparts with roughly identical model complexity and parameters. We believe that this work can unleash the memory constraints in SNN training and pave the way for training extremely large and deep SNNs. The code is available at https://github.com/mi804/RevSNN.git.

    "abstract": "Document dewarping, aiming to eliminate geometric deformation in photographed documents to benefit text recognition, has made great progress in recent years but is still far from being solved. While Cartesian coordinates are typically leveraged by state-of-the-art approaches to learn a group of deformation control points, such representation is not efficient for dewarping model to learn the deformation information. In this work, we explore Polar coordinates representation for each point in document dewarping, namely Polar-Doc. In contrast to most current works adopting a two-stage pipeline typically, Polar representation enables a unified point regression framework for both segmentation and dewarping network in one single stage. Such unification makes the whole model more efficient to learn under an end-to-end optimization pipeline, and also obtains a compact representation. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-scope Polar-Doc-IOU loss to constrain the relationship among control points as a grid-based regularization under the Polar representation. Visual comparisons and quantitative experiments on two benchmarks show that, with much fewer parameters than the other mainstream counterparts, our one-stage model with multi-scope constraints achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both pixel alignment metrics and OCR metrics.

    "abstract": "We consider a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. Specifically, the arms are strategic agents who can improve their rewards or absorb them. The utility of an agent increases if she is pulled more or absorbs more of her rewards but decreases if she spends more effort improving her rewards. Agents have heterogeneous properties, specifically having different means and able to improve their rewards up to different levels. Further, a non-empty subset of agents are ''honest'' and in the worst case always give their rewards without absorbing any part. The principal wishes to obtain a high revenue (cumulative reward) by designing a mechanism that incentives top level performance at equilibrium. At the same time, the principal wishes to be robust and obtain revenue at least at the level of the honest agent with the highest mean in case of non-equilibrium behaviour. We identify a class of MAB algorithms which we call performance incentivizing which satisfy a collection of properties and show that they lead to mechanisms that incentivize top level performance at equilibrium and are robust under any strategy profile. Interestingly, we show that UCB is an example of such a MAB algorithm. Further, in the case where the top performance level is unknown we show that combining second price auction ideas with performance incentivizing algorithms achieves performance at least at the second top level while also being robust.

Sequence embedding, which maps Levenshtein distance to a conventional distance between embedding vectors, has emerged as a promising solution. In this paper, a novel neural network-based sequence embedding technique using Poisson regression is proposed. We first provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of embedding dimension on model performance and present a criterion for selecting an appropriate embedding dimension. Under this embedding dimension, the Poisson regression is introduced by assuming the Levenshtein distance between sequences of fixed length following a Poisson distribution, which naturally aligns with the definition of Levenshtein distance. Moreover, from the perspective of the distribution of embedding distances, Poisson regression approximates the negative log likelihood of the chi-squared distribution and offers advancements in removing the skewness. Through comprehensive experiments on real DNA storage data, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches. ",

The results showed that YOLOv8 performed better than Mask R-CNN, achieving good precision and near-perfect recall across both datasets at a confidence threshold of 0.5. Specifically, for Dataset 1, YOLOv8 achieved a precision of 0.90 and a recall of 0.95 for all classes.

    "abstract": "Leveraging the advantage of satellite and terrestrial networks, the integrated satellite terrestrial networks (ISTNs) can help to achieve seamless global access and eliminate the digital divide. However, the dense deployment and frequent handover of satellites aggravate intra- and inter-system interference, resulting in a decrease in downlink sum rate. To address this issue, we propose a coordinated intra- and inter-system interference management algorithm for ISTN. This algorithm coordinates multidimensional interference through a joint design of inter-satellite handover and resource allocation method. On the one hand, we take inter-system interference between low earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary orbit (GEO) satellites as a constraint, and reduce interference to GEO satellite ground stations (GEO-GS) while ensuring system capacity through inter-satellite handover. On the other hand, satellite and terrestrial resource allocation schemes are designed based on the matching idea, and channel gain and interference to other channels are considered during the matching process to coordinate co-channel interference. In order to avoid too many unnecessary handovers, we consider handover scenarios related to service capabilities and service time to determine the optimal handover target satellite. Numerical results show that the gap between the results on the system sum rate obtained by the proposed method and the upper bound is reduced as the user density increases, and the handover frequency can be significantly reduced.

In this work, prediction models based on the exponential moving average (EMA) are investigated in depth, which are proven to outperform other simple statistical methods and whose performance is nearly as good as artificial neural networks, but with dramatically lower computational requirements. Regarding the innovation and motivation of this work, a new model that we called EMA linear combination (ELC), is introduced, explained, and evaluated experimentally. Its prediction accuracy, tested on some databases acquired from a real setup based on Wi-Fi devices, showed that ELC brings tangible improvements over EMA in any experimental conditions, the only drawback being a slight increase in computational complexity.

However, in text-to-image synthesis (T2Isyn), current augmentation wisdom still suffers from the semantic mismatch between augmented paired data. Even worse, semantic collapse may occur when generated images are less semantically constrained. In this paper, we develop a novel Semantic-aware Data Augmentation (SADA) framework dedicated to T2Isyn. In particular, we propose to augment texts in the semantic space via an Implicit Textual Semantic Preserving Augmentation ($ITA$), in conjunction with a specifically designed Image Semantic Regularization Loss ($L_r$) as Generated Image Semantic Conservation, to cope well with semantic mismatch and collapse. As one major contribution, we theoretically show that $ITA$ can certify better text-image consistency while $L_r$ regularizing the semantics of generated images would avoid semantic collapse and enhance image quality. Extensive experiments validate that SADA enhances text-image consistency and improves image quality significantly in T2Isyn models across various backbones. Especially, incorporating SADA during the tuning process of Stable Diffusion models also yields performance improvements. ",

    "abstract": "Researchers have recently found that Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. The attacker can embed hidden SSL backdoors via a few poisoned examples in the training dataset and maliciously manipulate the behavior of downstream models. To defend against SSL backdoor attacks, a feasible route is to detect and remove the poisonous samples in the training set. However, the existing SSL backdoor defense method fails to detect the poisonous samples precisely. In this paper, we propose to erase the SSL backdoor by cluster activation masking and propose a novel PoisonCAM method. After obtaining the threat model trained on the poisoned dataset, our method can precisely detect poisonous samples based on the assumption that masking the backdoor trigger can effectively change the activation of a downstream clustering model. In experiments, our PoisonCAM achieves 96% accuracy for backdoor trigger detection compared to 3% of the state-of-the-art method on poisoned ImageNet-100. Moreover, our proposed PoisonCAM significantly improves the performance of the trained SSL model under backdoor attacks compared to the state-of-the-art method.

    "abstract": "Decentralized Federated Learning (FL) has attracted significant attention due to its enhanced robustness and scalability compared to its centralized counterpart. It pivots on peer-to-peer communication rather than depending on a central server for model aggregation. While prior research has delved into various factors of decentralized FL such as aggregation methods and privacy-preserving techniques, one crucial aspect affecting privacy is relatively unexplored: the underlying graph topology. In this paper, we fill the gap by deriving a stringent privacy bound for decentralized FL under the condition that the accuracy is not compromised, highlighting the pivotal role of graph topology. Specifically, we demonstrate that the minimum privacy loss at each model aggregation step is dependent on the size of what we term as 'honest components', the maximally connected subgraphs once all untrustworthy participants are excluded from the networks, which is closely tied to network robustness. Our analysis suggests that attack-resilient networks will provide a superior privacy guarantee. We further validate this by studying both Poisson and power law networks, showing that the latter, being less robust against attacks, indeed reveals more privacy. In addition to a theoretical analysis, we consolidate our findings by examining two distinct privacy attacks: membership inference and gradient inversion. ",

In the entity typing stage, the correlations between entities and contexts are purified by minimizing the interference information and facilitating correlation generalization to alleviate the perturbations caused by textual adversarial attacks. In addition, we construct adversarial examples for few-shot NER based on public datasets Few-NERD and Cross-Dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on those two groups of few-shot NER datasets containing adversarial examples demonstrate the robustness and superiority of the proposed method. ",

Despite this, several challenges persist: 1) most methods are designed for static or discrete-time dynamic graphs; 2) existing continuous-time dynamic graph algorithms focus on a single evolving perspective; and 3) many continuous-time dynamic graph approaches necessitate numerous temporal neighbors to capture long-term dependencies. In response, this paper introduces the Multi-Perspective Feedback-Attention Coupling (MPFA) model. MPFA incorporates information from both evolving and raw perspectives, efficiently learning the interleaved dynamics of observed processes. The evolving perspective employs temporal self-attention to distinguish continuously evolving temporal neighbors for information aggregation. Through dynamic updates, this perspective can capture long-term dependencies using a small number of temporal neighbors. Meanwhile, the raw perspective utilizes a feedback attention module with growth characteristic coefficients to aggregate raw neighborhood information. Experimental results on a self-organizing dataset and seven public datasets validate the efficacy and competitiveness of our proposed model. ",

Many privacy-preserving clustering algorithms leverage cryptographic techniques like homomorphic encryption or secure multiparty computation, to guarantee full privacy, i.e., no additional information is leaked other than the final output. However, given the iterative nature of clustering algorithms, consistently encrypting intermediate outputs, such as centroids, hampers efficiency. This paper delves into this intricate trade-off, questioning the necessity of continuous encryption in iterative algorithms. Using the federated K-means clustering as an example, we mathematically formulate the problem of reconstructing input private data from the intermediate centroids as a classical cryptographic problem called hidden subset sum problem (HSSP)-extended from an NP-complete problem called subset sum problem (SSP). Through an in-depth analysis, we show that existing lattice-based HSSP attacks fail in reconstructing the private data given the knowledge of intermediate centroids, thus it is secure to reveal them for the sake of efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to cast federated clustering's privacy concerns as a cryptographic problem HSSP such that a concrete and rigorous analysis can be conducted. ",

Besides, a self-boosting learning strategy is further proposed to encourage the model to place more emphasis on challenging objects in computation-expensive temporal stereo matching. Together they provide advanced depth estimation results for high-quality BEV features construction, benefiting the ultimate 3D detection. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on the challenging nuScenes benchmark, and extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our designs. ",

    "abstract": "Class-agnostic motion prediction methods aim to comprehend motion within open-world scenarios, holding significance for autonomous driving systems. However, training a high-performance model in a fully-supervised manner always requires substantial amounts of manually annotated data, which can be both expensive and time-consuming to obtain. To address this challenge, our study explores the potential of semi-supervised learning (SSL) for class-agnostic motion prediction. Our SSL framework adopts a consistency-based self-training paradigm, enabling the model to learn from unlabeled data by generating pseudo labels through test-time inference. To improve the quality of pseudo labels, we propose a novel motion selection and re-generation module. This module effectively selects reliable pseudo labels and re-generates unreliable ones. Furthermore, we propose two data augmentation strategies: temporal sampling and BEVMix. These strategies facilitate consistency regularization in SSL. Experiments conducted on nuScenes demonstrate that our SSL method can surpass the self-supervised approach by a large margin by utilizing only a tiny fraction of labeled data. Furthermore, our method exhibits comparable performance to weakly and some fully supervised methods. These results highlight the ability of our method to strike a favorable balance between annotation costs and performance. Code will be available at https://github.com/kwwcv/SSMP. ",

We show that with a small number of images available for training, a model quantifying uncertainty performs better than a model without such functionality.

Various corresponding solutions rely on the efficient Sphinx packet format. However, flaws in Sphinx's underlying proof strategy were found recently. It is thus currently unclear which guarantees Sphinx actually provides, and, even worse, there is no suitable proof strategy available. In this paper, we restore the security foundation for all these works by building a theoretical framework for Sphinx. We discover that the previously-used DDH assumption is insufficient for a security proof and show that the Gap Diffie-Hellman (GDH) assumption is required instead. We apply it to prove that a slightly adapted version of the Sphinx packet format is secure under the GDH assumption. Ours is the first work to provide a detailed, in-depth security proof for Sphinx in this manner. Our adaptations to Sphinx are necessary, as we demonstrate with an attack on sender privacy that would be possible otherwise. ",

    "abstract": "Objective: Biomedical Knowledge Graphs play a pivotal role in various biomedical research domains. Concurrently, term clustering emerges as a crucial step in constructing these knowledge graphs, aiming to identify synonymous terms. Due to a lack of knowledge, previous contrastive learning models trained with Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) synonyms struggle at clustering difficult terms and do not generalize well beyond UMLS terms. In this work, we leverage the world knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose Contrastive Learning for Representing Terms via Explanations (CoRTEx) to enhance term representation and significantly improves term clustering. Materials and Methods: The model training involves generating explanations for a cleaned subset of UMLS terms using ChatGPT. We employ contrastive learning, considering term and explanation embeddings simultaneously, and progressively introduce hard negative samples. Additionally, a ChatGPT-assisted BIRCH algorithm is designed for efficient clustering of a new ontology. Results: We established a clustering test set and a hard negative test set, where our model consistently achieves the highest F1 score. With CoRTEx embeddings and the modified BIRCH algorithm, we grouped 35,580,932 terms from the Biomedical Informatics Ontology System (BIOS) into 22,104,559 clusters with O(N) queries to ChatGPT. Case studies highlight the model's efficacy in handling challenging samples, aided by information from explanations. Conclusion: By aligning terms to their explanations, CoRTEx demonstrates superior accuracy over benchmark models and robustness beyond its training set, and it is suitable for clustering terms for large-scale biomedical ontologies.

These authors work with a very strict symmetry definition based on the network's automorphism. The potential problem with this approach is that even a slight change in the graph's structure can remove or create some symmetry. Recently, Liu 2020 proposed to use an approximate automorphism instead of strict automorphism. This method can discover symmetries in the network while accepting some minor imperfections in their structure. The proposed numerical method, however, exhibits some performance problems and has some limitations while it assumes the absence of fixed points. In this work, we exploit alternative approaches recently developed for treating the Graph Matching Problem and propose a method, which we will refer to as Quadratic Symmetry Approximator (QSA), to address the aforementioned shortcomings. To test our method, we propose a set of random graph models suitable for assessing a wide family of approximate symmetry algorithms.

Existing approaches using classic machine learning or deep learning embed trajectories as dense vectors, which lack interpretability and are inefficient to store and analyze in downstream tasks. In this paper, an explainable trajectory representation learning framework through dictionary learning is proposed. Given a collection of trajectories on a network, it extracts a compact dictionary of commonly used subpaths called \"pathlets\", which optimally reconstruct each trajectory by simple concatenations. The resulting representation is naturally sparse and encodes strong spatial semantics. Theoretical analysis of our proposed algorithm is conducted to provide a probabilistic bound on the estimation error of the optimal dictionary. A hierarchical dictionary learning scheme is also proposed to ensure the algorithm's scalability on large networks, leading to a multi-scale trajectory representation. Our framework is evaluated on two large-scale real-world taxi datasets. Compared to previous work, the dictionary learned by our method is more compact and has better reconstruction rate for new trajectories. We also demonstrate the promising performance of this method in downstream tasks including trip time prediction task and data compression. ",

Despite the rapid advancement of reactive detectors, the exploration of adversarial socialbot modeling remains incomplete, significantly hindering the development of proactive detectors. To address this issue, we propose a mathematical Structural Information principles-based Adversarial Socialbots Modeling framework, namely SIASM, to enable more accurate and effective modeling of adversarial behaviors. First, a heterogeneous graph is presented to integrate various users and rich activities in the original social network and measure its dynamic uncertainty as structural entropy. By minimizing the high-dimensional structural entropy, a hierarchical community structure of the social network is generated and referred to as the optimal encoding tree. Secondly, a novel method is designed to quantify influence by utilizing the assigned structural entropy, which helps reduce the computational cost of SIASM by filtering out uninfluential users. Besides, a new conditional structural entropy is defined between the socialbot and other users to guide the follower selection for network influence maximization. Extensive and comparative experiments on both homogeneous and heterogeneous social networks demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art baselines, the proposed SIASM framework yields substantial performance improvements in terms of network influence (up to 16.32%) and sustainable stealthiness (up to 16.29%) when evaluated against a robust detector with 90% accuracy.

However, if an object with a different refractive index is included in a scene such as transparent object, NeRF shows limited performance because refracted light ray at the surface of the transparent object is not appropriately considered. To resolve the problem, we propose a NeRF-based method consisting of the following three steps: First, we reconstruct a three-dimensional shape of a transparent object using visual hull. Second, we simulate the refraction of the rays inside of the transparent object according to Snell's law. Last, we sample points through refracted rays and put them into NeRF.

It provides the effective allocation of resources to the unlicensed users or Secondary Users (SUs) to access the spectrum those are unused by the licensed users or Primary Users (Pus). This paper develops an Optimal Relay Selection scheme with the spectrum-sharing scheme in CRN. The proposed Cross-Layer Spider Swarm Shifting is implemented in CRN for the optimal relay selection with Spider Swarm Optimization (SSO). The shortest path is estimated with the data shifting model for the data transmission path in the CRN. This study examines a cognitive relay network (CRN) with interference restrictions imposed by a mobile end user (MU). Half-duplex communication is used in the proposed system model between a single primary user (PU) and a single secondary user (SU). Between the SU source and SU destination, an amplify and forward (AF) relaying mechanism is also used. While other nodes (SU Source, SU relays, and PU) are supposed to be immobile in this scenario, the mobile end user (SU destination) is assumed to travel at high vehicle speeds. The suggested method achieves variety by placing a selection combiner at the SU destination and dynamically selecting the optimal relay for transmission based on the greatest signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio. The performance of the proposed Cross-Layer Spider Swarm Shifting model is compared with the Spectrum Sharing Optimization with QoS Guarantee (SSO-QG). The comparative analysis expressed that the proposed Cross-Layer Spider Swarm Shifting model delay is reduced by 15% compared with SSO-QG. Additionally, the proposed Cross-Layer Spider Swarm Shifting exhibits the improved network performance of ~25% higher throughput compared with SSO-QG. ",

To maintain such a small memory footprint but achieve faster inference times, recent works have adopted `sampler' networks that adaptively sample a small subset of points along each ray in the implicit neural radiance fields. Although these methods achieve up to a 10$\\times$ reduction in rendering time, they still suffer from considerable quality degradation compared to the vanilla NeRF. In contrast, we propose ProNeRF, which provides an optimal trade-off between memory footprint (similar to NeRF), speed (faster than HyperReel), and quality (better than K-Planes). ProNeRF is equipped with a novel projection-aware sampling (PAS) network together with a new training strategy for ray exploration and exploitation, allowing for efficient fine-grained particle sampling. Our ProNeRF yields state-of-the-art metrics, being 15-23x faster with 0.65dB higher PSNR than NeRF and yielding 0.95dB higher PSNR than the best published sampler-based method, HyperReel. Our exploration and exploitation training strategy allows ProNeRF to learn the full scenes' color and density distributions while also learning efficient ray sampling focused on the highest-density regions.

Empirical p-values have been used to quantify the relative strength of an observed node activation compared to activations created by already-known inputs. Nonetheless, keeping raw data for these calculations increases memory resource consumption and raises privacy concerns. To this end, we propose a model-agnostic framework for creating representations of activations in DNNs using node-specific histograms to compute p-values of observed activations without retaining already-known inputs. Our proposed approach demonstrates promising potential when validated with multiple network architectures across various downstream tasks and compared with the kernel density estimates and brute-force empirical baselines. In addition, the framework reduces memory usage by 30% with up to 4 times faster p-value computing time while maintaining state of-the-art detection power in downstream tasks such as the detection of adversarial attacks and synthesized content.

A few solutions have been proposed to reduce grid load, for example, using storage systems for storing surplus energy from EVs or time-scheduling supply. These solutions are costly and limited to specific regions and times. This paper proposes a smart energy management solution for a massively electrified road transport network. It comprises of energy supplies from grid, charging stations, renewable sources and EVs connected by 5G-enabled aggregators. We propose EVs as prosumers, which are energy consumers but also supply back their surplus energy via Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology. We use machine learning to forecast hourly energy output from renewable sources, surplus supply from EVs and their demands. A grid cost minimization using Mixed Integer Linear Programming solution is proposed to dynamically alter supply according to demand and energy provision from EVs. The upper bounds of surplus supply and demand of EVs are theoretically derived. An incentive distribution mechanism is presented to reward EVs offering their surplus supply and to discourage them to become selfish which is analyzed using Prisoner's dilemma game. The paper also presents an optimum number of charging stations on a road. Simulation results show that the proposed solution can effectively meet the demand requirements even if the supply from grid is limited, and can averagely reduce 38.21% of grid load. It results in 5.3% of average cost reduction compared with optimization without prosumers. The proposed penalty charge for CO2 emissions results in over 50% cost reduction by using renewable resources in the proposed solution as compared to fossil fuels. The communication and computation complexity of the proposed solution is reduced by 5G-enabled aggregator. ",

    "abstract": "Deep-learning accelerators are increasingly in demand; however, their performance is constrained by the size of the feature map, leading to high bandwidth requirements and large buffer sizes. We propose an adaptive scale feature map compression technique leveraging the unique properties of the feature map. This technique adopts independent channel indexing given the weak channel correlation and utilizes a cubical-like block shape to benefit from strong local correlations. The method further optimizes compression using a switchable endpoint mode and adaptive scale interpolation to handle unimodal data distributions, both with and without outliers. This results in 4$\\times$ and up to 7.69$\\times$ compression rates for 16-bit data in constant and variable bitrates, respectively. Our hardware design minimizes area cost by adjusting interpolation scales, which facilitates hardware sharing among interpolation points. Additionally, we introduce a threshold concept for straightforward interpolation, preventing the need for intricate hardware. The TSMC 28nm implementation showcases an equivalent gate count of 6135 for the 8-bit version. Furthermore, the hardware architecture scales effectively, with only a sublinear increase in area cost. Achieving a 32$\\times$ throughput increase meets the theoretical bandwidth of DDR5-6400 at just 7.65$\\times$ the hardware cost. ",

    "abstract": "When selecting committees based on preferences of voters, a variety of different criteria can be considered. Two natural objectives are maximizing the utilitarian welfare (the sum of voters' utilities) and coverage (the number of represented voters) of the selected committee. Previous work has studied the impact on utilitarian welfare and coverage when requiring the committee to satisfy minimal requirements such as justified representation or weak proportionality. In this paper, we consider the impact of imposing much more demanding proportionality axioms. We identify a class of voting rules that achieve strong guarantees on utilitarian welfare and coverage when combined with appropriate completions. This class is defined via a weakening of priceability and contains prominent rules such as the Method of Equal Shares. We show that committees selected by these rules (i) can be completed to achieve optimal coverage and (ii) can be completed to achieve an asymptotically optimal approximation to the utilitarian welfare if they additionally satisfy EJR+. Answering an open question of Elkind et al. (2022), we use the Greedy Justified Candidate Rule to obtain the best possible utilitarian guarantee subject to proportionality. We also consider completion methods suggested in the participatory budgeting literature and other objectives besides welfare and coverage. ",

To address these issues, we construct a Multi-Scene Infrared Pre-training (MSIP) dataset comprising 178,756 images, and introduce object-sensitive random RoI cropping, an image preprocessing method, to tackle the challenge posed by non-iconic images. To alleviate the impact of weak textures on feature learning, we propose a pre-training paradigm called Pre-training with ADapter (PAD), which uses adapters to learn domain-specific features while freezing parameters pre-trained on ImageNet to retain the general feature extraction capability. This new paradigm is applicable to any transformer-based SSL method. Furthermore, to achieve more flexible coordination between pre-trained and newly-learned features in different layers and patches, a patchwise-scale adapter with dynamically learnable scale factors is introduced. Extensive experiments on three downstream tasks show that PAD, with only 1.23M pre-trainable parameters, outperforms other baseline paradigms including continual full pre-training on MSIP.

We evaluate our system on the VIRAT surveillance video dataset, and we show a median 43.7% speed improvement in FAST feature detection compared to OpenCV.

Suicide can result from social factors such as shame, abuse, abandonment, and mental health conditions like depression, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, and bipolar disorders. As these conditions develop, signs of suicidal ideation may manifest in social media interactions. Analyzing social media data using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can help identify patterns of suicidal behavior, providing invaluable insights for suicide prevention agencies, professionals, and broader community awareness initiatives. Machine learning algorithms for this purpose require large volumes of accurately labeled data. Previous research has not fully explored the potential of incorporating explanations in analyzing and labeling longitudinal social media data. In this study, we employed a model explanation method, Layer Integrated Gradients, on top of a fine-tuned state-of-the-art language model, to assign each token from Reddit users' posts an attribution score for predicting suicidal ideation. By extracting and analyzing attributions of tokens from the data, we propose a methodology for preliminary screening of social media posts for suicidal ideation without using large language models during inference.

To automate the detection process, prior works have proposed varieties of machine learning (ML) approaches to train Language Models (LMs) for toxic content detection. However, both their accuracy and transferability across datasets are limited. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in toxic content detection due to their superior zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning ability as well as broad transferability on ML tasks. However, efficiently designing prompts for LLMs remains challenging. Moreover, the high run-time cost of LLMs may hinder their deployments in production. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose BD-LLM, a novel and efficient approach to Bootstrapping and Distilling LLMs for toxic content detection. Specifically, we design a novel prompting method named Decision-Tree-of-Thought (DToT) to bootstrap LLMs' detection performance and extract high-quality rationales. DToT can automatically select more fine-grained context to re-prompt LLMs when their responses lack confidence. Additionally, we use the rationales extracted via DToT to fine-tune student LMs. Our experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that DToT can improve the accuracy of LLMs by up to 4.6%. Furthermore, student LMs fine-tuned with rationales extracted via DToT outperform baselines on all datasets with up to 16.9\\% accuracy improvement, while being more than 60x smaller than conventional LLMs. Finally, we observe that student LMs fine-tuned with rationales exhibit better cross-dataset transferability.

However, U-shape networks cannot effectively resolve this challenge due to the lack of boundary shape constraints. Besides, existing methods of refining boundaries overemphasize the slender structure, which results in the overfitting phenomenon due to networks' limited abilities to model tiny objects. In this paper, we reconceptualize the mechanism of boundary generation by encompassing the interaction dynamics with adjacent regions. Moreover, we propose a unified network termed PnPNet to model shape characteristics of the confused boundary region. Core ingredients of PnPNet contain the pushing and pulling branches. Specifically, based on diffusion theory, we devise the semantic difference module (SDM) from the pushing branch to squeeze the boundary region. Explicit and implicit differential information inside SDM significantly boost representation abilities for inter-class boundaries. Additionally, motivated by the K-means algorithm, the class clustering module (CCM) from the pulling branch is introduced to stretch the intersected boundary region. Thus, pushing and pulling branches will shrink and enlarge the boundary uncertainty respectively. They furnish two adversarial forces to promote models to output a more precise delineation of boundaries. We carry out experiments on three challenging public datasets and one in-house dataset, containing three types of boundary confusion in model predictions. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of PnPNet over other segmentation networks, especially on evaluation metrics of HD and ASSD. Besides, pushing and pulling branches can serve as plug-and-play modules to enhance classic U-shape baseline models. Codes are available. ",

Graphs that require distributed settings are often too large to fit in the main memory of a single machine. This challenge renders traditional in-memory graph partitioners infeasible, leading to the emergence of streaming solutions. Streaming partitioners produce lower-quality partitions because they work from partial information and must make premature decisions before they have a complete view of a vertex's neighborhood. We introduce CUTTANA, a streaming graph partitioner that partitions massive graphs (Web/Twitter scale) with superior quality compared to existing streaming solutions. CUTTANA uses a novel buffering technique that prevents the premature assignment of vertices to partitions and a scalable coarsening and refinement technique that enables a complete graph view, improving the intermediate assignment made by a streaming partitioner. We implemented a parallel version for CUTTANA that offers nearly the same partitioning latency as existing streaming partitioners. Our experimental analysis shows that CUTTANA consistently yields better partitioning quality than existing state-of-the-art streaming vertex partitioners in terms of both edge-cut and communication volume metrics. We also evaluate the workload latencies that result from using CUTTANA and other partitioners in distributed graph analytics and databases. CUTTANA outperforms the other methods in most scenarios (algorithms, datasets). In analytics applications, CUTTANA improves runtime performance by up to 59% compared to various streaming partitioners (HDRF, Fennel, Ginger, HeiStream). In graph database tasks, CUTTANA results in higher query throughput by up to 23%, without hurting tail latency. ",

Many previous works have applied deep learning techniques to 3D point clouds for instance segmentation. However, these methods often failed to generalize to various types of scenes due to the scarcity and low-diversity of labeled 3D point cloud data. Some recent works have attempted to lift 2D instance segmentations to 3D within a bottom-up framework. The inconsistency in 2D instance segmentations among views can substantially degrade the performance of 3D segmentation. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D-to-2D query framework to effectively exploit 2D segmentation models for 3D instance segmentation. Specifically, we pre-segment the scene into several superpoints in 3D, formulating the task into a graph cut problem. The superpoint graph is constructed based on 2D segmentation models, where node features are obtained from multi-view image features and edge weights are computed based on multi-view segmentation results, enabling the better generalization ability. To process the graph, we train a graph neural network using pseudo 3D labels from 2D segmentation models. Experimental results on the ScanNet, ScanNet++ and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust segmentation performance and can generalize across different types of scenes.

To decrease model misclassifications, two key steps of image processing were employed. Firstly, the uppermost and lowermost slices were removed, preserving sixty percent of each patient's slices. Secondly, all slices underwent manual cropping to emphasize the lung areas. Subsequently, resized CT scans (224 by 224) were input into an Xception transfer learning model. Leveraging Xception's architecture and pre-trained weights, the modified model achieved binary classification. Promising results on the COV19-CT database showcased higher validation accuracy and macro F1 score at both the slice and patient levels compared to our previous solution and alternatives on the same dataset.

    "abstract": "Indoor localization is the process of determining the location of a person or object inside a building. Potential usage of indoor localization includes navigation, personalization, safety and security, and asset tracking. Commonly used technologies for indoor localization include WiFi, Bluetooth, RFID, and Ultra-wideband. Among these, WiFi's Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)-based localization is preferred because of widely available WiFi Access Points (APs). We have two main contributions. First, we develop our method, 'IndoorGNN' which involves using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based algorithm in a supervised manner to classify a specific location into a particular region based on the RSSI values collected at that location. Most of the ML algorithms that perform this classification require a large number of labeled data points (RSSI vectors with location information). Collecting such data points is a labor-intensive and time-consuming task. To overcome this challenge, as our second contribution, we demonstrate the performance of IndoorGNN on the restricted dataset. It shows a comparable prediction accuracy to that of the complete dataset. We performed experiments on the UJIIndoorLoc and MNAV datasets, which are real-world standard indoor localization datasets. Our experiments show that IndoorGNN gives better location prediction accuracies when compared with state-of-the-art existing conventional as well as GNN-based methods for this same task. It continues to outperform these algorithms even with restricted datasets. It is noteworthy that its performance does not decrease a lot with a decrease in the number of available data points. Our method can be utilized for navigation and wayfinding in complex indoor environments, asset tracking and building management, enhancing mobile applications with location-based services, and improving safety and security during emergencies.

For tasks where voxel-level precision is not required, object detection models offer a viable alternative that can reduce annotation effort. Despite this potential application, there are few options for general purpose object detection frameworks available for 3-D medical imaging. We report on MedYOLO, a 3-D object detection framework using the one-shot detection method of the YOLO family of models and designed for use with medical imaging. We tested this model on four different datasets: BRaTS, LIDC, an abdominal organ Computed Tomography (CT) dataset, and an ECG-gated heart CT dataset. We found our models achieve high performance on commonly present medium and large-sized structures such as the heart, liver, and pancreas even without hyperparameter tuning. However, the models struggle with very small or rarely present structures. ",

    "abstract": "As the popularity of deep learning (DL) in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to rise, recent research has indicated that DL-based MRI reconstruction models might be excessively sensitive to minor input disturbances, including worst-case additive perturbations. This sensitivity often leads to unstable, aliased images. This raises the question of how to devise DL techniques for MRI reconstruction that can be robust to train-test variations. To address this problem, we propose a novel image reconstruction framework, termed Smoothed Unrolling (SMUG), which advances a deep unrolling-based MRI reconstruction model using a randomized smoothing (RS)-based robust learning approach. RS, which improves the tolerance of a model against input noises, has been widely used in the design of adversarial defense approaches for image classification tasks. Yet, we find that the conventional design that applies RS to the entire DL-based MRI model is ineffective. In this paper, we show that SMUG and its variants address the above issue by customizing the RS process based on the unrolling architecture of a DL-based MRI reconstruction model. Compared to the vanilla RS approach, we show that SMUG improves the robustness of MRI reconstruction with respect to a diverse set of instability sources, including worst-case and random noise perturbations to input measurements, varying measurement sampling rates, and different numbers of unrolling steps. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the robustness of our method in the presence of perturbations. ",

    "abstract": "Radio signal classification plays a pivotal role in identifying the modulation scheme used in received radio signals, which is essential for demodulation and proper interpretation of the transmitted information. Researchers have underscored the high susceptibility of ML algorithms for radio signal classification to adversarial attacks. Such vulnerability could result in severe consequences, including misinterpretation of critical messages, interception of classified information, or disruption of communication channels. Recent advancements in quantum computing have revolutionized theories and implementations of computation, bringing the unprecedented development of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). It is shown that quantum variational classifiers (QVCs) provide notably enhanced robustness against classical adversarial attacks in image classification. However, no research has yet explored whether QML can similarly mitigate adversarial threats in the context of radio signal classification. This work applies QVCs to radio signal classification and studies their robustness to various adversarial attacks. We also propose the novel application of the approximate amplitude encoding (AAE) technique to encode radio signal data efficiently. Our extensive simulation results present that attacks generated on QVCs transfer well to CNN models, indicating that these adversarial examples can fool neural networks that they are not explicitly designed to attack. However, the converse is not true. QVCs primarily resist the attacks generated on CNNs. Overall, with comprehensive simulations, our results shed new light on the growing field of QML by bridging knowledge gaps in QAML in radio signal classification and uncovering the advantages of applying QML methods in practical applications.

Identifying and treating pneumonia on chest X-ray images can be difficult due to its similarity to other pulmonary diseases. Thus, the existing methods for predicting pneumonia cannot attain substantial levels of accuracy. Therefore, this paper presents a computer-aided classification of pneumonia, coined as Ensemble Learning (EL), to simplify the diagnosis process on chest X-ray images. Our proposal is based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, which are pre-trained CNN models that have been recently employed to enhance the performance of many medical tasks instead of training CNN models from scratch. We propose to use three well-known CNN pre-trained (DenseNet169, MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformer) using the ImageNet database. Then, these models are trained on the chest X-ray data set using fine-tuning. Finally, the results are obtained by combining the extracted features from these three models during the experimental phase. The proposed EL approach outperforms other existing state-of-the-art methods, and it obtains an accuracy of 93.91% and a F1-Score of 93.88% on the testing phase. ",

    "abstract": "In today's digital landscape, journalists urgently require tools to verify the authenticity of facial images and videos depicting specific public figures before incorporating them into news stories. Existing deepfake detectors are not optimized for this detection task when an image is associated with a specific and identifiable individual. This study focuses on the deepfake detection of facial images of individual public figures. We propose to condition the proposed detector on the identity of the identified individual given the advantages revealed by our theory-driven simulations. While most detectors in the literature rely on perceptible or imperceptible artifacts present in deepfake facial images, we demonstrate that the detection performance can be improved by exploiting the idempotency property of neural networks. In our approach, the training process involves double neural-network operations where we pass an authentic image through a deepfake simulating network twice. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the area under the curve (AUC) from 0.92 to 0.94 and reduces its standard deviation by 17\\%. For evaluating the detection performance of individual public figures, a facial image dataset with individuals' names is required, a criterion not met by the current deepfake datasets. To address this, we curated a dataset comprising 32k images featuring 45 public figures, which we intend to release to the public after the paper is published. ",

While existing methods primarily focus on managing uncertainty during infer-ence, uMoE integrates uncertainty directly into the train-ing process. The uMoE approach adopts a \"Divide and Conquer\" paradigm to partition the uncertain input space into more manageable subspaces. It consists of Expert components, each trained solely on the portion of input uncertainty corresponding to their subspace. On top of the Experts, a Gating Unit, guided by additional infor-mation about the distribution of uncertain inputs across these subspaces, learns to weight the Experts to minimize deviations from the ground truth. Our results highlight that uMoE significantly outperforms baseline methods in handling data uncertainty. Furthermore, we conducted a robustness analysis, illustrating its capability to adapt to varying levels of uncertainty and suggesting optimal threshold parameters. This innovative approach holds wide applicability across diverse data-driven domains, in-cluding biomedical signal processing, autonomous driv-ing, and production quality control. ",

We then combine both FMPE and NPE with importance sampling, in which case both methods outperform nested sampling in terms of accuracy and simulation efficiency. Going forward, our analysis suggests that simulation-based inference with likelihood-based importance sampling provides a framework for accurate and efficient AR that may become a valuable tool not only for the analysis of observational data from existing telescopes, but also for the development of new missions and instruments.

    "abstract": "Equivariant neural networks have considerably improved the accuracy and data-efficiency of predictions of molecular properties. Building on this success, we introduce EquiReact, an equivariant neural network to infer properties of chemical reactions, built from three-dimensional structures of reactants and products. We illustrate its competitive performance on the prediction of activation barriers on the GDB7-22-TS, Cyclo-23-TS and Proparg-21-TS datasets with different regimes according to the inclusion of atom-mapping information. We show that, compared to state-of-the-art models for reaction property prediction, EquiReact offers: (i) a flexible model with reduced sensitivity between atom-mapping regimes, (ii) better extrapolation capabilities to unseen chemistries, (iii) impressive prediction errors for datasets exhibiting subtle variations in three-dimensional geometries of reactants/products, (iv) reduced sensitivity to geometry quality and (iv) excellent data efficiency.

    "abstract": "Image segmentation, real-value prediction, and cross-modal translation are critical challenges in medical imaging. In this study, we propose a versatile multi-task neural network framework, based on an enhanced Transformer U-Net architecture, capable of simultaneously, selectively, and adaptively addressing these medical image tasks. Validation is performed on a public repository of human brain MR and CT images. We decompose the traditional problem of synthesizing CT images into distinct subtasks, which include skull segmentation, Hounsfield unit (HU) value prediction, and image sequential reconstruction. To enhance the framework's versatility in handling multi-modal data, we expand the model with multiple image channels. Comparisons between synthesized CT images derived from T1-weighted and T2-Flair images were conducted, evaluating the model's capability to integrate multi-modal information from both morphological and pixel value perspectives.

A near triangulation is a 2-connected plane graph that has at most one face that is not a triangle. In this paper, we explore minimal cuts of 4-connected planar graphs. Our main result is that every minimal cut of a 4-connected planar graph $G$ is connected if and only if $G$ is a near-triangulation. We use this result to sketch a linear-time algorithm for finding a disconnected cut of a 4-connected planar graph. ",

The most uplifting result is the existence of a $\\{13,6,1;1,6,9\\}$-CR code in $H(n,2)$, $n\\ge 13$. We also establish the non-existence of a $\\{11,4;3,6\\}$-code and a $\\{10,3;4,7\\}$-code in $H(12,2)$ and $H(13,2)$. A partition of the complement of the quaternary Hamming code of length~$5$ into $4$-cliques is found, which can be used to construct completely regular codes with covering radius $1$ by known constructions. Additionally we discuss the parameters $\\{24,21,10;1,4,12\\}$ of a putative completely regular code in $H(24,2)$ and show the nonexistence of such a code in $H(8,4)$.
