    "abstract": "An acoustic model, trained on a significant amount of unlabeled data, consists of a self-supervised learned speech representation useful for solving downstream tasks, perhaps after a fine-tuning of the model in the respective downstream task. In this work, we build an acoustic model of Brazilian Portuguese Speech through a Transformer neural network. This model was pretrained on more than $800$ hours of Brazilian Portuguese Speech, using a combination of pretraining techniques. Using a labeled dataset collected for the detection of respiratory insufficiency in Brazilian Portuguese speakers, we fine-tune the pretrained Transformer neural network on the following tasks: respiratory insufficiency detection, gender recognition and age group classification. We compare the performance of pretrained Transformers on these tasks with that of Transformers without previous pretraining, noting a significant improvement. In particular, the performance of respiratory insufficiency detection obtains the best reported results so far, indicating this kind of acoustic model as a promising tool for speech-as-biomarker approach. Moreover, the performance of gender recognition is comparable to the state of the art models in English. ",

    "abstract": "The ongoing biodiversity crisis, driven by factors such as land-use change and global warming, emphasizes the need for effective ecological monitoring methods. Acoustic monitoring of biodiversity has emerged as an important monitoring tool. Detecting human voices in soundscape monitoring projects is useful both for analysing human disturbance and for privacy filtering. Despite significant strides in deep learning in recent years, the deployment of large neural networks on compact devices poses challenges due to memory and latency constraints. Our approach focuses on leveraging knowledge distillation techniques to design efficient, lightweight student models for speech detection in bioacoustics. In particular, we employed the MobileNetV3-Small-Pi model to create compact yet effective student architectures to compare against the larger EcoVAD teacher model, a well-regarded voice detection architecture in eco-acoustic monitoring. The comparative analysis included examining various configurations of the MobileNetV3-Small-Pi derived student models to identify optimal performance. Additionally, a thorough evaluation of different distillation techniques was conducted to ascertain the most effective method for model selection. Our findings revealed that the distilled models exhibited comparable performance to the EcoVAD teacher model, indicating a promising approach to overcoming computational barriers for real-time ecological monitoring.

    "abstract": "Modern attacks against enterprises often have multiple targets inside the enterprise network. Due to the large size of these networks and increasingly stealthy attacks, attacker activities spanning multiple hosts are extremely difficult to correlate during a threat-hunting effort. In this paper, we present a method for an efficient cross-host attack correlation across multiple hosts. Unlike previous works, our approach does not require lateral movement detection techniques or host-level modifications. Instead, our approach relies on an observation that attackers have a few strategic mission objectives on every host that they infiltrate, and there exist only a handful of techniques for achieving those objectives. The central idea behind our approach involves comparing (OS agnostic) activities on different hosts and correlating the hosts that display the use of similar tactics, techniques, and procedures. We implement our approach in a tool called Ostinato and successfully evaluate it in threat hunting scenarios involving DARPA-led red team engagements spanning 500 hosts and in another multi-host attack scenario. Ostinato successfully detected 21 additional compromised hosts, which the underlying host-based detection system overlooked in activities spanning multiple days of the attack campaign. Additionally, Ostinato successfully reduced alarms generated from the underlying detection system by more than 90%, thus helping to mitigate the threat alert fatigue problem ",

In this study, we combined a qualitative survey (n=119) with in-depth interviews (n=21) to investigate how older adults in America conceptualize, discern, and contextualize social media misinformation. As misinformation on social media in the past was driven towards influencing voting outcomes, we were particularly interested to approach our study from a voting intention perspective. We found that 62% of the participants intending to vote Democrat saw a manipulative political purpose behind the spread of misinformation while only 5% of those intending to vote Republican believed misinformation has a political dissent purpose. Regardless of the voting intentions, most participants relied on source heuristics combined with fact-checking to discern truth from misinformation on social media. The biggest concern about the misinformation, among all the participants, was that it increasingly leads to biased reasoning influenced by personal values and feelings instead of reasoning based on objective evidence. The participants intending to vote Democrat were in 74% of the cases concerned that misinformation will cause escalation of extremism in the future, while those intending to vote Republican, were undecided, or planned to abstain were concerned that misinformation will further erode the trust in democratic institutions, specifically in the context of public health and free and fair elections. During our interviews, we found that 63% of the participants who intended to vote Republican, were fully aware and acknowledged that Republican or conservative voices often time speak misinformation, even though they are closely aligned to their political ideology.

Yet, little is known about children's experience with misinformation as well as what their parents think of the misinformation's effect on child development. To answer these questions, we combined a qualitative survey of parents (n=87) with semi-structured interviews of both parents and children (n=12). We found that children usually encounter deep fakes, memes with political context, or celebrity/influencer rumors on social media. Children revealed they \"ask Siri\" whether a social media video or post is true or not before they search on Google or ask their parents about it. Parents expressed discontent that their children are impressionable to misinformation, stating that the burden falls on them to help their children develop critical thinking skills for navigating falsehoods on social media. Here, the majority of parents felt that schools should also teach these skills as well as media literacy to their children. Misinformation, according to both parents and children affects the family relationships especially with grandparents with different political views than theirs. ",

Such schemes rely on measurement-based estimated models, where the models are first estimated using raw measurements and then used in the control problem. This work focuses on measurement-based estimation of the voltage sensitivity coefficients which can be used for voltage control. In the existing literature, these coefficients are estimated using regression-based methods, which do not perform well in the case of high measurement noise. This work proposes tackling this problem by using neural network (NN)-based estimation of the voltage sensitivity coefficients which is robust against measurement noise. In particular, we propose using Feedforward and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The trained NNs take measurements of nodal voltage magnitudes and active and reactive powers and output the vector of voltage magnitude sensitivity coefficients. The performance of the proposed scheme is compared against the regression-based method for a CIGRE benchmark network. ",

    "abstract": "The functional analysis of the left atrium (LA) is important for evaluating cardiac health and understanding diseases like atrial fibrillation. Cine MRI is ideally placed for the detailed 3D characterisation of LA motion and deformation, but it is lacking appropriate acquisition and analysis tools. In this paper, we present Analysis for Left Atrial Displacements and Deformations using unsupervIsed neural Networks, \\textit{Aladdin}, to automatically and reliably characterise regional LA deformations from high-resolution 3D Cine MRI. The tool includes: an online few-shot segmentation network (Aladdin-S), an online unsupervised image registration network (Aladdin-R), and a strain calculations pipeline tailored to the LA. We create maps of LA Displacement Vector Field (DVF) magnitude and LA principal strain values from images of 10 healthy volunteers and 8 patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). We additionally create an atlas of these biomarkers using the data from the healthy volunteers. Aladdin is able to accurately track the LA wall across the cardiac cycle and characterize its motion and deformation. The overall DVF magnitude and principal strain values are significantly higher in the healthy group vs CVD patients: $2.85 \\pm 1.59~mm$ and $0.09 \\pm 0.05$ vs $1.96 \\pm 0.74~mm$ and $0.03 \\pm 0.04$, respectively. The time course of these metrics is also different in the two groups, with a more marked active contraction phase observed in the healthy cohort. Finally, utilizing the LA atlas allows us to identify regional deviations from the population distribution that may indicate focal tissue abnormalities. The proposed tool for the quantification of novel regional LA deformation biomarkers should have important clinical applications.

    "abstract": "High-fidelity 3D assets with materials composed of fibers (including hair), complex layered material shaders, or fine scattering geometry are ubiquitous in high-end realistic rendering applications. Rendering such models is computationally expensive due to heavy shaders and long scattering paths. Moreover, implementing the shading and scattering models is non-trivial and has to be done not only in the 3D content authoring software (which is necessarily complex), but also in all downstream rendering solutions. For example, web and mobile viewers for complex 3D assets are desirable, but frequently cannot support the full shading complexity allowed by the authoring application. Our goal is to design a neural representation for 3D assets with complex shading that supports full relightability and full integration into existing renderers. We provide an end-to-end shading solution at the first intersection of a ray with the underlying geometry. All shading and scattering is precomputed and included in the neural asset; no multiple scattering paths need to be traced, and no complex shading models need to be implemented to render our assets, beyond a single neural architecture. We combine an MLP decoder with a feature grid. Shading consists of querying a feature vector, followed by an MLP evaluation producing the final reflectance value. Our method provides high-fidelity shading, close to the ground-truth Monte Carlo estimate even at close-up views. We believe our neural assets could be used in practical renderers, providing significant speed-ups and simplifying renderer implementations. ",

This topic spans various techniques, from structured pruning to neural architecture search, encompassing both pruning and erasing operators perspectives.

We introduce the third-generation Only-Train-Once (OTOv3), which first automatically trains and compresses a general DNN through pruning and erasing operations, creating a compact and competitive sub-network without the need of fine-tuning. OTOv3 simplifies and automates the training and compression process, minimizes the engineering efforts required from users. It offers key technological advancements: (i) automatic search space construction for general DNNs based on dependency graph analysis; (ii) Dual Half-Space Projected Gradient (DHSPG) and its enhanced version with hierarchical search (H2SPG) to reliably solve (hierarchical) structured sparsity problems and ensure sub-network validity; and (iii) automated sub-network construction using solutions from DHSPG/H2SPG and dependency graphs. Our empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of OTOv3 across various benchmarks in structured pruning and neural architecture search.

However, current methods confine themselves to presumed data manifolds, assuming that trajectories strictly adhere to these manifolds, resulting in overly simplified predictions. To this end, we propose a novel approach called SSWNP (Self-Supervised Waypoint Noise Prediction). In our approach, we first create clean and noise-augmented views of past observed trajectories across the spatial domain of waypoints. We then compel the trajectory prediction model to maintain spatial consistency between predictions from these two views, in addition to the trajectory prediction task. Introducing the noise-augmented view mitigates the model's reliance on a narrow interpretation of the data manifold, enabling it to learn more plausible and diverse representations. We also predict the noise present in the two views of past observed trajectories as an auxiliary self-supervised task, enhancing the model's understanding of the underlying representation and future predictions. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the incorporation of SSWNP into the model learning process significantly improves performance, even in noisy environments, when compared to baseline methods. Our approach can complement existing trajectory prediction methods. To showcase the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments on three datasets: NBA Sports VU, ETH-UCY, and TrajNet++, with experimental results highlighting the substantial improvement achieved in trajectory prediction tasks.

    "abstract": "In response to the rapidly evolving nature of adversarial attacks on a monthly basis, numerous defenses have been proposed to generalize against as many known attacks as possible. However, designing a defense method that can generalize to all types of attacks, including unseen ones, is not realistic because the environment in which defense systems operate is dynamic and comprises various unique attacks used by many attackers. The defense system needs to upgrade itself by utilizing few-shot defense feedback and efficient memory. Therefore, we propose the first continual adversarial defense (CAD) framework that adapts to any attacks in a dynamic scenario, where various attacks emerge stage by stage. In practice, CAD is modeled under four principles: (1) continual adaptation to new attacks without catastrophic forgetting, (2) few-shot adaptation, (3) memory-efficient adaptation, and (4) high accuracy on both clean and adversarial images. We leverage cutting-edge continual learning, few-shot learning, and ensemble learning techniques to qualify the principles. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 validate the effectiveness of our approach against multiple stages of 10 modern adversarial attacks and significant improvements over 10 baseline methods. In particular, CAD is capable of quickly adapting with minimal feedback and a low cost of defense failure, while maintaining good performance against old attacks. Our research sheds light on a brand-new paradigm for continual defense adaptation against dynamic and evolving attacks. ",

In this paper, we propose No-Skim, a general framework to help the owners of skimming-based LLM to understand and measure the robustness of their acceleration scheme. Specifically, our framework searches minimal and unnoticeable perturbations at character-level and token-level to generate adversarial inputs that sufficiently increase the remaining token ratio, thus increasing the computation cost and energy consumption. We systematically evaluate the vulnerability of the skimming acceleration in various LLM architectures including BERT and RoBERTa on the GLUE benchmark. In the worst case, the perturbation found by No-Skim substantially increases the running cost of LLM by over 145% on average. Moreover, No-Skim extends the evaluation framework to various scenarios, making the evaluation conductible with different level of knowledge. ",

However, constructing an end-to-end graph structure learning model poses a challenge due to the impediment of gradient flow caused by the nearest neighbor sampling strategy. In this paper, we construct a differential graph structure learning model by replacing the non-differentiable nearest neighbor sampling with a differentiable sampling using the reparameterization trick. Under this framework, we argue that the act of sampling \\mbox{nearest} neighbors may not invariably be essential, particularly in instances where node features exhibit a significant degree of similarity. To alleviate this issue, the bell-shaped Gaussian Similarity (GauSim) modeling is proposed to sample non-nearest neighbors. To adaptively model the similarity, we further propose Neural Gaussian Similarity (NeuralGauSim) with learnable parameters featuring flexible sampling behaviors. In addition, we develop a scalable method by transferring the large-scale graph to the transition graph to significantly reduce the complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. ",

    "abstract": "Motion prediction is a crucial task in autonomous driving, and one of its major challenges lands in the multimodality of future behaviors. Many successful works have utilized mixture models which require identification of positive mixture components, and correspondingly fall into two main lines: prediction-based and anchor-based matching. The prediction clustering phenomenon in prediction-based matching makes it difficult to pick representative trajectories for downstream tasks, while the anchor-based matching suffers from a limited regression capability. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm, named Evolving and Distinct Anchors (EDA), to define the positive and negative components for multimodal motion prediction based on mixture models. We enable anchors to evolve and redistribute themselves under specific scenes for an enlarged regression capacity. Furthermore, we select distinct anchors before matching them with the ground truth, which results in impressive scoring performance. Our approach enhances all metrics compared to the baseline MTR, particularly with a notable relative reduction of 13.5% in Miss Rate, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.

Our study aims to exploit multimodal features more effectively in order to accurately capture users' preferences for items. To this end, we point out following two limitations of existing GCN-based multimedia recommender systems: (L1) although multimodal features of interacted items by a user can reveal her preferences on items, existing methods utilize GCN designed to focus only on capturing collaborative signals, resulting in insufficient reflection of the multimodal features in the final user/item embeddings; (L2) although a user decides whether to prefer the target item by considering its multimodal features, existing methods represent her as only a single embedding regardless of the target item's multimodal features and then utilize her embedding to predict her preference for the target item. To address the above issues, we propose a novel multimedia recommender system, named MONET, composed of following two core ideas: modality-embracing GCN (MeGCN) and target-aware attention. Through extensive experiments using four real-world datasets, we demonstrate i) the significant superiority of MONET over seven state-of-the-art competitors (up to 30.32% higher accuracy in terms of recall@20, compared to the best competitor) and ii) the effectiveness of the two core ideas in MONET.

While researchers have extensively explored the integrity of AD perception due to its safety and security implications, the aspect of availability (real-time performance) or latency has received limited attention. Existing works on latency-based attack have focused mainly on object detection, i.e., a component in camera-based AD perception, overlooking the entire camera-based AD perception, which hinders them to achieve effective system-level effects, such as vehicle crashes. In this paper, we propose SlowTrack, a novel framework for generating adversarial attacks to increase the execution time of camera-based AD perception. We propose a novel two-stage attack strategy along with the three new loss function designs. Our evaluation is conducted on four popular camera-based AD perception pipelines, and the results demonstrate that SlowTrack significantly outperforms existing latency-based attacks while maintaining comparable imperceptibility levels. Furthermore, we perform the evaluation on Baidu Apollo, an industry-grade full-stack AD system, and LGSVL, a production-grade AD simulator, with two scenarios to compare the system-level effects of SlowTrack and existing attacks. Our evaluation results show that the system-level effects can be significantly improved, i.e., the vehicle crash rate of SlowTrack is around 95% on average while existing works only have around 30%.

    "abstract": "The optical flow guidance strategy is ideal for obtaining motion information of objects in the video. It is widely utilized in video segmentation tasks. However, existing optical flow-based methods have a significant dependency on optical flow, which results in poor performance when the optical flow estimation fails for a particular scene. The temporal consistency provided by the optical flow could be effectively supplemented by modeling in a structural form. This paper proposes a new hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) architecture, dubbed hierarchical graph pattern understanding (HGPU), for zero-shot video object segmentation (ZS-VOS). Inspired by the strong ability of GNNs in capturing structural relations, HGPU innovatively leverages motion cues (\\ie, optical flow) to enhance the high-order representations from the neighbors of target frames. Specifically, a hierarchical graph pattern encoder with message aggregation is introduced to acquire different levels of motion and appearance features in a sequential manner. Furthermore, a decoder is designed for hierarchically parsing and understanding the transformed multi-modal contexts to achieve more accurate and robust results. HGPU achieves state-of-the-art performance on four publicly available benchmarks (DAVIS-16, YouTube-Objects, Long-Videos and DAVIS-17).

However, promoting coordination among agents and enhancing exploration capabilities remain challenges. In multi-agent environments, interactions between agents are limited in specific situations. Effective collaboration between agents thus requires a nuanced understanding of when and how agents' actions influence others. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel MARL algorithm named Situation-Dependent Causal Influence-Based Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (SCIC), which incorporates a novel Intrinsic reward mechanism based on a new cooperation criterion measured by situation-dependent causal influence among agents. Our approach aims to detect inter-agent causal influences in specific situations based on the criterion using causal intervention and conditional mutual information. This effectively assists agents in exploring states that can positively impact other agents, thus promoting cooperation between agents. The resulting update links coordinated exploration and intrinsic reward distribution, which enhance overall collaboration and performance.

The non-robust nature of physical adversarial attack methods brings less-than-stable performance consequently. To enhance the robustness of physical adversarial attacks in the real world, instead of statically optimizing a robust adversarial example via an off-line training manner like the existing methods, this paper proposes a brand new robust adversarial attack framework: Embodied Adversarial Attack (EAA) from the perspective of dynamic adaptation, which aims to employ the paradigm of embodied intelligence: Perception-Decision-Control to dynamically adjust the optimal attack strategy according to the current situations in real time. For the perception module, given the challenge of needing simulation for the victim's viewpoint, EAA innovatively devises a Perspective Transformation Network to estimate the target's transformation from the attacker's perspective. For the decision and control module, EAA adopts the laser-a highly manipulable medium to implement physical attacks, and further trains an attack agent with reinforcement learning to make it capable of instantaneously determining the best attack strategy based on the perceived information. Finally, we apply our framework to the autonomous driving scenario. A variety of experiments verify the high effectiveness of our method under complex scenes. ",

In the meanwhile, 3D adversarial samples, due to their potential of multi-view robustness, can more comprehensively identify weaknesses in existing deep learning systems, possessing great application value. However, the field of transferable targeted 3D adversarial attacks remains vacant. The goal of this work is to develop a more effective technique that could generate transferable targeted 3D adversarial examples, filling the gap in this field. To achieve this goal, we design a novel framework named TT3D that could rapidly reconstruct from few multi-view images into Transferable Targeted 3D textured meshes. While existing mesh-based texture optimization methods compute gradients in the high-dimensional mesh space and easily fall into local optima, leading to unsatisfactory transferability and distinct distortions, TT3D innovatively performs dual optimization towards both feature grid and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) parameters in the grid-based NeRF space, which significantly enhances black-box transferability while enjoying naturalness. Experimental results show that TT3D not only exhibits superior cross-model transferability but also maintains considerable adaptability across different renders and vision tasks. More importantly, we produce 3D adversarial examples with 3D printing techniques in the real world and verify their robust performance under various scenarios. ",

Vulnerability exploits, as code snippets provided for reproducing vulnerabilities after disclosure, contain a wealth of vulnerability-related information. This study proposes a new method based on vulnerability exploits, called VESTA (Vulnerability Exploit-based Software Testing Auto-Generator), which provides vulnerability exploit tests as the basis for developers to decide whether to update dependencies. VESTA extends the search-based test generation methods by adding a migration step, ensuring the similarity between the generated test and the vulnerability exploit, which increases the likelihood of detecting potential library vulnerabilities in a project. We perform experiments on 30 vulnerabilities disclosed in the past five years, involving 60 vulnerability-project pairs, and compare the experimental results with the baseline method, TRANSFER. The success rate of VESTA is 71.7\\% which is a 53.4\\% improvement over TRANSFER in the effectiveness of verifying exploitable vulnerabilities. ",

    "abstract": "Legal case retrieval and judgment prediction are crucial components in intelligent legal systems. In practice, determining whether two cases share the same charges through legal judgment prediction is essential for establishing their relevance in case retrieval. However, current studies on legal case retrieval merely focus on the semantic similarity between paired cases, ignoring their charge-level consistency. This separation leads to a lack of context and potential inaccuracies in the case retrieval that can undermine trust in the system's decision-making process. Given the guidance role of laws to both tasks and inspired by the success of generative retrieval, in this work, we propose to incorporate judgment prediction into legal case retrieval, achieving a novel law-aware Generative legal case retrieval method called Gear. Specifically, Gear first extracts rationales (key circumstances and key elements) for legal cases according to the definition of charges in laws, ensuring a shared and informative representation for both tasks. Then in accordance with the inherent hierarchy of laws, we construct a law structure constraint tree and assign law-aware semantic identifier(s) to each case based on this tree. These designs enable a unified traversal from the root, through intermediate charge nodes, to case-specific leaf nodes, which respectively correspond to two tasks. Additionally, in the training, we also introduce a revision loss that jointly minimizes the discrepancy between the identifiers of predicted and labeled charges as well as retrieved cases, improving the accuracy and consistency for both tasks. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that Gear consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in legal case retrieval while maintaining competitive judgment prediction performance. ",

The rationality of the generated data is further ensured through theoretical foundations. Drawing insights from analyses conducted using our dataset, we introduce a lightweight and highly adaptable GNN module designed to strengthen GNNs' causal learning capabilities across a diverse range of tasks. Through a series of experiments conducted on both synthetic datasets and other real-world datasets, we empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed module. ",

    "abstract": "As the number and complexity of malware attacks continue to increase, there is an urgent need for effective malware detection systems. While deep learning models are effective at detecting malware, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Attacks like this can create malicious files that are resistant to detection, creating a significant cybersecurity risk. Recent research has seen the development of several adversarial attack and response approaches aiming at strengthening deep learning models' resilience to such attacks. This survey study offers an in-depth look at current research in adversarial attack and defensive strategies for malware classification in cybersecurity. The methods are classified into four categories: generative models, feature-based approaches, ensemble methods, and hybrid tactics. The article outlines cutting-edge procedures within each area, assessing their benefits and drawbacks. Each topic presents cutting-edge approaches and explores their advantages and disadvantages. In addition, the study discusses the datasets and assessment criteria that are often utilized on this subject. Finally, it identifies open research difficulties and suggests future study options.

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of speech synthesis and voice conversion has raised substantial concerns due to the potential misuse of such technology, prompting a pressing need for effective audio deepfake detection mechanisms. Existing detection models have shown remarkable success in discriminating known deepfake audio, but struggle when encountering new attack types. To address this challenge, one of the emergent effective approaches is continual learning. In this paper, we propose a continual learning approach called Radian Weight Modification (RWM) for audio deepfake detection. The fundamental concept underlying RWM involves categorizing all classes into two groups: those with compact feature distributions across tasks, such as genuine audio, and those with more spread-out distributions, like various types of fake audio. These distinctions are quantified by means of the in-class cosine distance, which subsequently serves as the basis for RWM to introduce a trainable gradient modification direction for distinct data types. Experimental evaluations against mainstream continual learning methods reveal the superiority of RWM in terms of knowledge acquisition and mitigating forgetting in audio deepfake detection. Furthermore, RWM's applicability extends beyond audio deepfake detection, demonstrating its potential significance in diverse machine learning domains such as image recognition. ",

    "abstract": "Speech recognition systems driven by DNNs have revolutionized human-computer interaction through voice interfaces, which significantly facilitate our daily lives. However, the growing popularity of these systems also raises special concerns on their security, particularly regarding backdoor attacks. A backdoor attack inserts one or more hidden backdoors into a DNN model during its training process, such that it does not affect the model's performance on benign inputs, but forces the model to produce an adversary-desired output if a specific trigger is present in the model input. Despite the initial success of current audio backdoor attacks, they suffer from the following limitations: (i) Most of them require sufficient knowledge, which limits their widespread adoption. (ii) They are not stealthy enough, thus easy to be detected by humans. (iii) Most of them cannot attack live speech, reducing their practicality. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose FlowMur, a stealthy and practical audio backdoor attack that can be launched with limited knowledge. FlowMur constructs an auxiliary dataset and a surrogate model to augment adversary knowledge. To achieve dynamicity, it formulates trigger generation as an optimization problem and optimizes the trigger over different attachment positions. To enhance stealthiness, we propose an adaptive data poisoning method according to Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Furthermore, ambient noise is incorporated into the process of trigger generation and data poisoning to make FlowMur robust to ambient noise and improve its practicality. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets demonstrate that FlowMur achieves high attack performance in both digital and physical settings while remaining resilient to state-of-the-art defenses. In particular, a human study confirms that triggers generated by FlowMur are not easily detected by participants. ",

    "abstract": "Robot calligraphy is an emerging exploration of artificial intelligence in the fields of art and education. Traditional calligraphy generation researches mainly focus on methods such as tool-based image processing, generative models, and style transfer. Unlike the English alphabet, the number of Chinese characters is tens of thousands, which leads to difficulties in the generation of a style consistent Chinese calligraphic font with over 6000 characters. Due to the lack of high-quality data sets, formal definitions of calligraphy knowledge, and scientific art evaluation methods, The results generated are frequently of low quality and falls short of professional-level requirements. To address the above problem, this paper proposes an automatic calligraphy generation model based on deep generative adversarial networks (deepGAN) that can generate style calligraphy fonts with professional standards. The key highlights of the proposed method include: (1) The datasets use a high-precision calligraphy synthesis method to ensure its high quality and sufficient quantity; (2) Professional calligraphers are invited to conduct a series of Turing tests to evaluate the gap between model generation results and human artistic level; (3) Experimental results indicate that the proposed model is the state-of-the-art among current calligraphy generation methods. The Turing tests and similarity evaluations validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

This is mainly due to the limited availability of comprehensive representations. This paper presents an approach that utilizes knowledge graphs to model the diverse entities and their semantic connections within traffic scenes. Further, we present nuScenes Knowledge Graph (nSKG), a knowledge graph for the nuScenes dataset, that models explicitly all scene participants and road elements, as well as their semantic and spatial relationships.

However, previous methods usually blend multi-view information in a posteriors stage, falling short in learning coherent and consistent representations across different views. In this paper, we form a new pipeline to learn consistent representations across varying views, and propose the multi-view Contrastive Prediction model for urban Region embedding (ReCP), which leverages the multiple information views from point-of-interest (POI) and human mobility data. Specifically, ReCP comprises two major modules, namely an intra-view learning module utilizing contrastive learning and feature reconstruction to capture the unique information from each single view, and inter-view learning module that perceives the consistency between the two views using a contrastive prediction learning scheme. We conduct thorough experiments on two downstream tasks to assess the proposed model, i.e., land use clustering and region popularity prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods significantly in urban region representation learning. ",

    "abstract": "Continuous machine learning pipelines are common in industrial settings where models are periodically trained on data streams. Unfortunately, concept drifts may occur in data streams where the joint distribution of the data X and label y, P(X, y), changes over time and possibly degrade model accuracy. Existing concept drift adaptation approaches mostly focus on updating the model to the new data possibly using ensemble techniques of previous models and tend to discard the drifted historical data. However, we contend that explicitly utilizing the drifted data together leads to much better model accuracy and propose Quilt, a data-centric framework for identifying and selecting data segments that maximize model accuracy. To address the potential downside of efficiency, Quilt extends existing data subset selection techniques, which can be used to reduce the training data without compromising model accuracy. These techniques cannot be used as is because they only assume virtual drifts where the posterior probabilities P(y|X) are assumed not to change. In contrast, a key challenge in our setup is to also discard undesirable data segments with concept drifts. Quilt thus discards drifted data segments and selects data segment subsets holistically for accurate and efficient model training. The two operations use gradient-based scores, which have little computation overhead. In our experiments, we show that Quilt outperforms state-of-the-art drift adaptation and data selection baselines on synthetic and real datasets. ",

In this work, we present the first approach for robustness verification of DRL-based control systems by introducing reward martingales, which offer a rigorous mathematical foundation to characterize the impact of state perturbations on system performance in terms of cumulative rewards. Our verified results provide provably quantitative certificates for the two questions. We then show that reward martingales can be implemented and trained via neural networks, against different types of control policies. Experimental results demonstrate that our certified bounds tightly enclose simulation outcomes on various DRL-based control systems, indicating the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach.

To address this limitation, this paper presents GraphRARE, a general framework built upon node relative entropy and deep reinforcement learning, to strengthen the expressive capability of GNNs. An innovative node relative entropy, which considers node features and structural similarity, is used to measure mutual information between node pairs. In addition, to avoid the sub-optimal solutions caused by mixing useful information and noises of remote nodes, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm is developed to optimize the graph topology. This algorithm selects informative nodes and discards noisy nodes based on the defined node relative entropy. Extensive experiments are conducted on seven real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of GraphRARE in node classification and its capability to optimize the original graph topology. ",

Concretely, we first refactor the core module of ZSL, i.e., visual-semantics mapping function, into several base linear networks that correspond to diverse components of the semantic space, where the complex nonlinearity can be collapsed into simple local linearities. Then, to facilitate the generalization of local linearities, we construct a maximal margin geometry on the learned features by enforcing low-rank constraints on intra-class samples and high-rank constraints on inter-class samples, resulting in orthogonal subspaces for different classes and each subspace lies on a compact manifold. To enhance the model's adaptability and counterbalance over/under-fittings in ZSL, a set of sample-wise indicators is employed to select a sparse subset from these base linear networks to form a composite semantic predictor for each sample. Notably, maximal margin geometry can guarantee the diversity of features, and meanwhile, local linearities guarantee efficiency. Thus, our ParsNets can generalize better to unseen classes and can be deployed flexibly on resource-constrained devices. Theoretical explanations and extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. ",

Most existing CTR Prediction models utilize explicit feature interactions to overcome the performance bottleneck of implicit feature interactions.

However, these parallel subcomponents lack effective supervisory signals, making it challenging to efficiently capture valuable multi-views feature interaction information in different semantic spaces. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective novel CTR model: Contrast-enhanced Through Network for CTR (CETN), so as to ensure the diversity and homogeneity of feature interaction information. Specifically, CETN employs product-based feature interactions and the augmentation (perturbation) concept from contrastive learning to segment different semantic spaces, each with distinct activation functions. This improves diversity in the feature interaction information captured by the model. Additionally, we introduce self-supervised signals and through connection within each semantic space to ensure the homogeneity of the captured feature interaction information. The experiments and research conducted on four real datasets demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms twenty baseline models in terms of AUC and Logloss. ",

Due to the limitations of small-sample datasets, existing methods typically adopt ML algorithms to regress numerical properties or transfer other pre-trained knowledge graphs (KGs) to the material. However, these methods cannot simultaneously handle semantic and numerical information. In this paper, we propose a numerical reasoning method for material KGs (NR-KG), which constructs a cross-modal KG using semantic nodes and numerical proxy nodes. It captures both types of information by projecting KG into a canonical KG and utilizes a graph neural network to predict material properties. In this process, a novel projection prediction loss is proposed to extract semantic features from numerical information. NR-KG facilitates end-to-end processing of cross-modal data, mining relationships and cross-modal information in small-sample datasets, and fully utilizes valuable experimental data to enhance material prediction. We further propose two new High-Entropy Alloys (HEA) property datasets with semantic descriptions. NR-KG outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving relative improvements of 25.9% and 16.1% on two material datasets. Besides, NR-KG surpasses SOTA methods on two public physical chemistry molecular datasets, showing improvements of 22.2% and 54.3%, highlighting its potential application and generalizability.

Despite spotlights around, recent theoretical results verified that some causal features recovered by IRLs merely pretend domain-invariantly in the training environments but fail in unseen domains. The \\emph{fake invariance} severely endangers OOD generalization since the trustful objective can not be diagnosed and existing causal surgeries are invalid to rectify. In this paper, we review a IRL family (InvRat) under the Partially and Fully Informative Invariant Feature Structural Causal Models (PIIF SCM /FIIF SCM) respectively, to certify their weaknesses in representing fake invariant features, then, unify their causal diagrams to propose ReStructured SCM (RS-SCM). RS-SCM can ideally rebuild the spurious and the fake invariant features simultaneously. Given this, we further develop an approach based on conditional mutual information with respect to RS-SCM, then rigorously rectify the spurious and fake invariant effects. It can be easily implemented by a small feature selection subnet introduced in the IRL family, which is alternatively optimized to achieve our goal. Experiments verified the superiority of our approach to fight against the fake invariant issue across a variety of OOD generalization benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce RANRAC, a robust reconstruction algorithm for 3D objects handling occluded and distracted images, which is a particularly challenging scenario that prior robust reconstruction methods cannot deal with. Our solution supports single-shot reconstruction by involving light-field networks, and is also applicable to photo-realistic, robust, multi-view reconstruction from real-world images based on neural radiance fields. While the algorithm imposes certain limitations on the scene representation and, thereby, the supported scene types, it reliably detects and excludes inconsistent perspectives, resulting in clean images without floating artifacts. Our solution is based on a fuzzy adaption of the random sample consensus paradigm, enabling its application to large scale models. We interpret the minimal number of samples to determine the model parameters as a tunable hyperparameter. This is applicable, as a cleaner set of samples improves reconstruction quality. Further, this procedure also handles outliers. Especially for conditioned models, it can result in the same local minimum in the latent space as would be obtained with a completely clean set. We report significant improvements for novel-view synthesis in occluded scenarios, of up to 8dB PSNR compared to the baseline. ",

    "abstract": "Explaining predictions of black-box neural networks is crucial when applied to decision-critical tasks. Thus, attribution maps are commonly used to identify important image regions, despite prior work showing that humans prefer explanations based on similar examples. To this end, ProtoPNet learns a set of class-representative feature vectors (prototypes) for case-based reasoning. During inference, similarities of latent features to prototypes are linearly classified to form predictions and attribution maps are provided to explain the similarity. In this work, we evaluate whether architectures for case-based reasoning fulfill established axioms required for faithful explanations using the example of ProtoPNet. We show that such architectures allow the extraction of faithful explanations. However, we prove that the attribution maps used to explain the similarities violate the axioms. We propose a new procedure to extract explanations for trained ProtoPNets, named ProtoPFaith. Conceptually, these explanations are Shapley values, calculated on the similarity scores of each prototype. They allow to faithfully answer which prototypes are present in an unseen image and quantify each pixel's contribution to that presence, thereby complying with all axioms. The theoretical violations of ProtoPNet manifest in our experiments on three datasets (CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, RSNA) and five architectures (ConvNet, ResNet, ResNet50, WideResNet50, ResNeXt50). Our experiments show a qualitative difference between the explanations given by ProtoPNet and ProtoPFaith. Additionally, we quantify the explanations with the Area Over the Perturbation Curve, on which ProtoPFaith outperforms ProtoPNet on all experiments by a factor $>10^3$. ",

However, high-resolution and accurate multi-physics computational models are computationally expensive and their personalisation involves fine calibration of a large number of parameters, which may be space-dependent, challenging their clinical translation. In this work, we propose a new approach which relies on the combination of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with three-dimensional soft tissue nonlinear biomechanical models, capable of reconstructing displacement fields and estimating heterogeneous patient-specific biophysical properties. The proposed learning algorithm encodes information from a limited amount of displacement and, in some cases, strain data, that can be routinely acquired in the clinical setting, and combines it with the physics of the problem, represented by a mathematical model based on partial differential equations, to regularise the problem and improve its convergence properties. Several benchmarks are presented to show the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method and its great potential to enable the robust and effective identification of patient-specific, heterogeneous physical properties, s.a. tissue stiffness properties. In particular, we demonstrate the capability of the PINN to detect the presence, location and severity of scar tissue, which is beneficial to develop personalised simulation models for disease diagnosis, especially for cardiac applications.

With this new training objective we are able to increase object detection performance by a large margin.

Some nodes may have an incentive to evade such measures, i.e., to hide their actual importance, in order to conceal their true role in the network. A number of studies have been proposed in the literature to understand how nodes can rewire the network in order to evade standard centrality, but no study has focused on group centrality to date. We close this gap by analyzing four group centrality measures: degree, closeness, betweenness, and GED-walk. We show that an optimal way to rewire the network can be computed efficiently given the former measure, but the problem is NP-complete given closeness and betweenness. Moreover, we empirically evaluate a number of hiding strategies, and show that an optimal way to hide from degree group centrality is also effective in practice against the other measures. Altogether, our results suggest that it is possible to hide from group centrality measures based solely on the local information available to the group members about the network topology. ",

Leveraging external cues such as human pose or parsing to locate and align part features has been proven to be very effective in occluded person ReID. Meanwhile, recent Transformer structures have a strong ability of long-range modeling. Considering the above facts, we propose a Teacher-Student Decoder (TSD) framework for occluded person ReID, which utilizes the Transformer decoder with the help of human parsing. More specifically, our proposed TSD consists of a Parsing-aware Teacher Decoder (PTD) and a Standard Student Decoder (SSD). PTD employs human parsing cues to restrict Transformer's attention and imparts this information to SSD through feature distillation. Thereby, SSD can learn from PTD to aggregate information of body parts automatically. Moreover, a mask generator is designed to provide discriminative regions for better ReID. In addition, existing occluded person ReID benchmarks utilize occluded samples as queries, which will amplify the role of alleviating occlusion interference and underestimate the impact of the feature absence issue. Contrastively, we propose a new benchmark with non-occluded queries, serving as a complement to the existing benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is superior and the new benchmark is essential. The source codes are available at https://github.com/hh23333/TSD. ",

We define three \\textit{filtering scores} for quantifying the fragility, robustness and antifragility characteristics of DNN parameters based on the performances for (i) clean dataset, (ii) adversarial dataset, and (iii) the difference in performances of clean and adversarial datasets. We validate the proposed systematic analysis on ResNet-18, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-v1.1 and ShuffleNet V2 x1.0 network architectures for MNIST, CIFAR10 and Tiny ImageNet datasets. The filtering scores, for a given network architecture, identify network parameters that are invariant in characteristics across different datasets over learning epochs. Vice-versa, for a given dataset, the filtering scores identify the parameters that are invariant in characteristics across different network architectures. We show that our synaptic filtering method improves the test accuracy of ResNet and ShuffleNet models on adversarial datasets when only the robust and antifragile parameters are selectively retrained at any given epoch, thus demonstrating applications of the proposed strategy in improving model robustness.

However, existing methods produce low-quality scene reconstruction and low-accuracy localization performance when scaling up to large indoor scenes and long sequences. These limitations are mainly due to their single, global radiance field with finite capacity, which does not adapt to large scenarios. Their end-to-end pose networks are also not robust enough with the growth of cumulative errors in large scenes. To this end, we present PLGSLAM, a neural visual SLAM system which performs high-fidelity surface reconstruction and robust camera tracking in real time. To handle large-scale indoor scenes, PLGSLAM proposes a progressive scene representation method which dynamically allocates new local scene representation trained with frames within a local sliding window. This allows us to scale up to larger indoor scenes and improves robustness (even under pose drifts). In local scene representation, PLGSLAM utilizes tri-planes for local high-frequency features. We also incorporate multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks for the low-frequency feature, smoothness, and scene completion in unobserved areas. Moreover, we propose local-to-global bundle adjustment method with a global keyframe database to address the increased pose drifts on long sequences. Experimental results demonstrate that PLGSLAM achieves state-of-the-art scene reconstruction results and tracking performance across various datasets and scenarios (both in small and large-scale indoor environments).

In this paper, we study the use of LLM-generated context information and propose an approach to distill the generated information during fine-tuning of self-supervised speech models, which we refer to as generative context-aware fine-tuning. This approach allows the fine-tuned model to make improved predictions without access to the true surrounding segments or to the LLM at inference time, while requiring only a very small additional context module. We evaluate the proposed approach using the SLUE and Libri-light benchmarks for several downstream tasks: automatic speech recognition, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. The results show that generative context-aware fine-tuning outperforms a context injection fine-tuning approach that accesses the ground-truth previous text, and is competitive with a generative context injection fine-tuning approach that requires the LLM at inference time.

To address this issue, prior studies mainly introduce item features (e.g., thumbnails) for cold-start item recommendation. They learn a feature extractor on warm-start items to align feature representations with interactions, and then leverage the feature extractor to extract the feature representations of cold-start items for interaction prediction. Unfortunately, the features of cold-start items, especially the popular ones, tend to diverge from those of warm-start ones due to temporal feature shifts, preventing the feature extractor from accurately learning feature representations of cold-start items. To alleviate the impact of temporal feature shifts, we consider using Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) to enhance the generation ability of the feature extractor. Nonetheless, existing DRO methods face an inconsistency issue: the worse-case warm-start items emphasized during DRO training might not align well with the cold-start item distribution. To capture the temporal feature shifts and combat this inconsistency issue, we propose a novel temporal DRO with new optimization objectives, namely, 1) to integrate a worst-case factor to improve the worst-case performance, and 2) to devise a shifting factor to capture the shifting trend of item features and enhance the optimization of the potentially popular groups in cold-start items. Substantial experiments on three real-world datasets validate the superiority of our temporal DRO in enhancing the generalization ability of cold-start recommender models. ",

However, editing implicit or hybrid representations as used for NeRFs is difficult due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry encoded in the model parameters. Despite these challenges, recent research has shown first promising steps towards photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance edits. The main open issues of related work include limited interactivity, a lack of support for local edits and large memory requirements, rendering them less useful in practice. We address these limitations with LAENeRF, a unified framework for photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance editing of NeRFs. To tackle local editing, we leverage a voxel grid as starting point for region selection. We learn a mapping from expected ray terminations to final output color, which can optionally be supervised by a style loss, resulting in a framework which can perform photorealistic and non-photorealistic appearance editing of selected regions. Relying on a single point per ray for our mapping, we limit memory requirements and enable fast optimization. To guarantee interactivity, we compose the output color using a set of learned, modifiable base colors, composed with additive layer mixing. Compared to concurrent work, LAENeRF enables recoloring and stylization while keeping processing time low. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. ",

In light of recent progress on information preservation guarantees for sketches based on random features, a major objective is to design easy-to-tune algorithms (called decoders) to robustly and efficiently extract this information. To address the underlying non-convex optimization problems, various heuristics have been proposed. In the case of compressive clustering, the standard heuristic is CL-OMPR, a variant of sliding Frank-Wolfe. Yet, CL-OMPR is hard to tune, and the examination of its robustness was overlooked. In this work, we undertake a scrutinized examination of CL-OMPR to circumvent its limitations. In particular, we show how this algorithm can fail to recover the clusters even in advantageous scenarios. To gain insight, we show how the deficiencies of this algorithm can be attributed to optimization difficulties related to the structure of a correlation function appearing at core steps of the algorithm. To address these limitations, we propose an alternative decoder offering substantial improvements over CL-OMPR. Its design is notably inspired from the mean shift algorithm, a classic approach to detect the local maxima of kernel density estimators. The proposed algorithm can extract clustering information from a sketch of the MNIST dataset that is 10 times smaller than previously. ",

    "title": "Peer Learning: Learning Complex Policies in Groups from Scratch via  Action Recommendations",
    "abstract": "Peer learning is a novel high-level reinforcement learning framework for agents learning in groups. While standard reinforcement learning trains an individual agent in trial-and-error fashion, all on its own, peer learning addresses a related setting in which a group of agents, i.e., peers, learns to master a task simultaneously together from scratch. Peers are allowed to communicate only about their own states and actions recommended by others: \"What would you do in my situation?\". Our motivation is to study the learning behavior of these agents. We formalize the teacher selection process in the action advice setting as a multi-armed bandit problem and therefore highlight the need for exploration. Eventually, we analyze the learning behavior of the peers and observe their ability to rank the agents' performance within the study group and understand which agents give reliable advice. Further, we compare peer learning with single agent learning and a state-of-the-art action advice baseline. We show that peer learning is able to outperform single-agent learning and the baseline in several challenging discrete and continuous OpenAI Gym domains. Doing so, we also show that within such a framework complex policies from action recommendations beyond discrete action spaces can evolve. ",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in learning techniques have garnered attention for their applicability to a diverse range of real-world sequential decision-making problems. Yet, many practical applications have critical constraints for operation in real environments. Most learning solutions often neglect the risk of failing to meet these constraints, hindering their implementation in real-world contexts. In this paper, we propose a risk-aware decision-making framework for contextual bandit problems, accommodating constraints and continuous action spaces. Our approach employs an actor multi-critic architecture, with each critic characterizing the distribution of performance and constraint metrics. Our framework is designed to cater to various risk levels, effectively balancing constraint satisfaction against performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we first compare it against state-of-the-art baseline methods in a synthetic environment, highlighting the impact of intrinsic environmental noise across different risk configurations. Finally, we evaluate our framework in a real-world use case involving a 5G mobile network where only our approach consistently satisfies the system constraint (a signal processing reliability target) with a small performance toll (8.5% increase in power consumption).

    "abstract": "Graph matching is a fundamental problem in pattern recognition, with many applications such as software analysis and computational biology. One well-known type of graph matching problem is graph isomorphism, which consists of deciding if two graphs are identical. Despite its usefulness, the properties that one may check using graph isomorphism are rather limited, since it only allows strict equality checks between two graphs. For example, it does not allow one to check complex structural properties such as if the target graph is an arbitrary length sequence followed by an arbitrary size loop. We propose a generalization of graph isomorphism that allows one to check such properties through a declarative specification. This specification is given in the form of a Regular Graph Pattern (ReGaP), a special type of graph, inspired by regular expressions, that may contain wildcard nodes that represent arbitrary structures such as variable-sized sequences or subgraphs. We propose a SAT-based algorithm for checking if a target graph matches a given ReGaP. We also propose a preprocessing technique for improving the performance of the algorithm and evaluate it through an extensive experimental evaluation on benchmarks from the CodeSearchNet dataset. ",

Although researchers have made considerable progress in this area, further work is still required due to resource constraints. This study examines innovative approaches to expedite the training process of deep neural networks (DNN), with specific emphasis on three state-of-the-art models such as ResNet50, Vision Transformer (ViT), and EfficientNet. The research utilizes sophisticated methodologies, including Gradient Accumulation (GA), Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP), and Pin Memory (PM), in order to optimize performance and accelerate the training procedure. The study examines the effects of these methodologies on the DNN models discussed earlier, assessing their efficacy with regard to training rate and computational efficacy. The study showcases the efficacy of including GA as a strategic approach, resulting in a noteworthy decrease in the duration required for training. This enables the models to converge at a faster pace. The utilization of AMP enhances the speed of computations by taking advantage of the advantages offered by lower precision arithmetic while maintaining the correctness of the model. Furthermore, this study investigates the application of Pin Memory as a strategy to enhance the efficiency of data transmission between the central processing unit and the graphics processing unit, thereby offering a promising opportunity for enhancing overall performance. The experimental findings demonstrate that the combination of these sophisticated methodologies significantly accelerates the training of DNNs, offering vital insights for experts seeking to improve the effectiveness of deep learning processes.

Two classical approaches to solving these problems are Dynamic Programming and the Pontryagin Maximum Principle. In both approaches, Hamiltonian equations offer an interpretation of optimality through auxiliary variables known as costates. However, Hamiltonian equations are rarely used due to their reliance on forward-backward algorithms across the entire temporal domain. This paper introduces a novel neural-based approach to optimal control, with the aim of working forward-in-time. Neural networks are employed not only for implementing state dynamics but also for estimating costate variables. The parameters of the latter network are determined at each time step using a newly introduced local policy referred to as the time-reversed generalized Riccati equation. This policy is inspired by a result discussed in the Linear Quadratic (LQ) problem, which we conjecture stabilizes state dynamics. We support this conjecture by discussing experimental results from a range of optimal control case studies. ",

The primary aim is to simultaneously predict both the shoulder and elbow joint angles while executing elbow flexion-extension (FE) movements, especially under varying load conditions. The PINN model is constructed by combining a feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with a joint torque computation model. During the training process, the model utilizes a custom loss function derived from an inverse dynamics joint torque musculoskeletal model, along with a mean square angle loss. The training dataset for the PINN model comprises EMG and time data collected from four different subjects. To assess the model's performance, we conducted a comparison between the predicted joint angles and experimental data using a testing data set. The results demonstrated strong correlations of 58% to 83% in joint angle prediction. The findings highlight the potential of incorporating physical principles into the model, not only increasing its versatility but also enhancing its accuracy. The findings could have significant implications for the precise estimation of multi-joint kinematics in dynamic scenarios, particularly concerning the advancement of human-machine interfaces (HMIs) for exoskeletons and prosthetic control systems.

With a focus on ensuring fairness among UAVs, our objective is to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at UAVs by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming parameters at the BS and phase shift parameters at RISs. We propose two novel algorithms to address this problem. The first algorithm aims to mitigate interference by calculating the BS beamforming matrix through matrix inverse operations once the phase shift parameters are determined. The second one is based on the principle that one RIS element only serves one UAV and the phase shift parameter of this RIS element is optimally designed to compensate the phase offset caused by the propagation and fading. To obtain the optimal parameters, we utilize one state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, deep deterministic policy gradient, to solve these two optimization problems. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution and some insightful remarks are observed. ",

    "abstract": "Cognitive Radar Networks, which were popularized by Simon Haykin in 2006, have been proposed to address limitations with legacy radar installations. These limitations include large physical size, power consumption, fixed operating parameters, and single point vulnerabilities. Cognitive radar solves part of this problem through adaptability, using biologically inspired techniques to observe the environment and adjust operation accordingly. Cognitive radar networks extend the capabilities of cognitive radar spatially, providing the opportunity to observe targets from multiple angles to mitigate stealth effects; distribute resources over space and in time; obtain better tracking performance; and gain more information from a scene. Often, problems of cognition in CRNs are viewed through the lens of iterative learning problems - one or multiple cognitive processes are implemented in the network, where each process first observes the environment, then selects operating parameters (from discrete or continuous options) using the history of observations and previous rewards, then repeats the cycle. Further, cognitive radar networks often are implemented with a flexible architecture and wide-bandwidth front-ends, enabling the addition of electronic support measures such as passive signal estimation. In this work we consider questions of the form \"How should a cognitive radar network choose when to observe targets?\" and \"How can a cognitive radar network reduce the amount of energy it uses?\" We implement tools from the multi-armed bandit and age of information literature to select modes for the network, choosing either an active radar mode or a passive signal estimation mode. We show that through the use of target classes, the network can determine how often each target should be observed to optimize tracking performance. ",

However, the impact of embedding EEG signals in the context of language models and the effect of subjectivity, remain unexplored, leading to uncertainty about the best approach to enhance decoding performance. Additionally, current evaluation metrics used to assess decoding effectiveness are predominantly syntactic and do not provide insights into the comprehensibility of the decoded output for human understanding. We present an end-to-end deep learning framework for non-invasive brain recordings that brings modern representational learning approaches to neuroscience.

Reliable auditory-EEG decoders could facilitate the objective diagnosis of hearing disorders, or find applications in cognitively-steered hearing aids. Previously, we developed decoders for the ICASSP Auditory EEG Signal Processing Grand Challenge (SPGC). These decoders aimed to solve the match-mismatch task: given a short temporal segment of EEG recordings, and two candidate speech segments, the task is to identify which of the two speech segments is temporally aligned, or matched, with the EEG segment. The decoders made use of cortical responses to the speech envelope, as well as speech-related frequency-following responses, to relate the EEG recordings to the speech stimuli. Here we comprehensively document the methods by which the decoders were developed. We extend our previous analysis by exploring the association between speaker characteristics (pitch and sex) and classification accuracy, and provide a full statistical analysis of the final performance of the decoders as evaluated on a heldout portion of the dataset. Finally, the generalisation capabilities of the decoders are characterised, by evaluating them using an entirely different dataset which contains EEG recorded under a variety of speech-listening conditions. The results show that the match-mismatch decoders achieve accurate and robust classification accuracies, and they can even serve as auditory attention decoders without additional training. ",

We investigate the locality of LNO by looking into its receptive field and receptive range, carrying a main concern about how the locality acts in LNO training and applications. In a large group of LNO training experiments for learning fluid dynamics, it is found that an initial receptive range compatible with the learning task is crucial for LNO to perform well. On the one hand, an over-small receptive range is fatal and usually leads LNO to numerical oscillation; on the other hand, an over-large receptive range hinders LNO from achieving the best accuracy. We deem rules found in this paper general when applying LNO to learn and solve transient PDEs in diverse fields. Practical examples of applying the pre-trained LNOs in flow prediction are presented to confirm the findings further. Overall, with the architecture properly designed with a compatible receptive range, the pre-trained LNO shows commendable accuracy and efficiency in solving practical cases. ",

    "abstract": "The identification of the Purkinje conduction system in the heart is a challenging task, yet essential for a correct definition of cardiac digital twins for precision cardiology. Here, we propose a probabilistic approach for identifying the Purkinje network from non-invasive clinical data such as the standard electrocardiogram (ECG). We use cardiac imaging to build an anatomically accurate model of the ventricles; we algorithmically generate a rule-based Purkinje network tailored to the anatomy; we simulate physiological electrocardiograms with a fast model; we identify the geometrical and electrical parameters of the Purkinje-ECG model with Bayesian optimization and approximate Bayesian computation. The proposed approach is inherently probabilistic and generates a population of plausible Purkinje networks, all fitting the ECG within a given tolerance. In this way, we can estimate the uncertainty of the parameters, thus providing reliable predictions. We test our methodology in physiological and pathological scenarios, showing that we are able to accurately recover the ECG with our model. We propagate the uncertainty in the Purkinje network parameters in a simulation of conduction system pacing therapy. Our methodology is a step forward in creation of digital twins from non-invasive data in precision medicine. An open source implementation can be found at this http URL ",

    "abstract": "In this pioneering research paper, we present a groundbreaking exploration into the synergistic fusion of classical and quantum computing paradigms within the realm of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our objective is to seamlessly integrate quantum computational elements into the conventional GAN architecture, thereby unlocking novel pathways for enhanced training processes. Drawing inspiration from the inherent capabilities of quantum bits (qubits), we delve into the incorporation of quantum data representation methodologies within the GAN framework. By capitalizing on the unique quantum features, we aim to accelerate the training process of GANs, offering a fresh perspective on the optimization of generative models. Our investigation deals with theoretical considerations and evaluates the potential quantum advantages that may manifest in terms of training efficiency and generative quality. We confront the challenges inherent in the quantum-classical amalgamation, addressing issues related to quantum hardware constraints, error correction mechanisms, and scalability considerations. This research is positioned at the forefront of quantum-enhanced machine learning, presenting a critical stride towards harnessing the computational power of quantum systems to expedite the training of Generative Adversarial Networks. Through our comprehensive examination of the interface between classical and quantum realms, we aim to uncover transformative insights that will propel the field forward, fostering innovation and advancing the frontier of quantum machine learning.

    "abstract": "WHO's report on environmental noise estimates that 22 M people suffer from chronic annoyance related to noise caused by audio events (AEs) from various sources. Annoyance may lead to health issues and adverse effects on metabolic and cognitive systems. In cities, monitoring noise levels does not provide insights into noticeable AEs, let alone their relations to annoyance. To create annoyance-related monitoring, this paper proposes a graph-based model to identify AEs in a soundscape, and explore relations between diverse AEs and human-perceived annoyance rating (AR). Specifically, this paper proposes a lightweight multi-level graph learning (MLGL) based on local and global semantic graphs to simultaneously perform audio event classification (AEC) and human annoyance rating prediction (ARP). Experiments show that: 1) MLGL with 4.1 M parameters improves AEC and ARP results by using semantic node information in local and global context aware graphs; 2) MLGL captures relations between coarse and fine-grained AEs and AR well; 3) Statistical analysis of MLGL results shows that some AEs from different sources significantly correlate with AR, which is consistent with previous research on human perception of these sound sources.

    "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted sensor networks (UASNets), which play a crucial role in creating new opportunities, are experiencing significant growth in civil applications worldwide. UASNets improve disaster management through timely surveillance and advance precision agriculture with detailed crop monitoring, thereby significantly transforming the commercial economy. UASNets revolutionize the commercial sector by offering greater efficiency, safety, and cost-effectiveness, highlighting their transformative impact. A fundamental aspect of these new capabilities and changes is the collection of data from rugged and remote areas. Due to their excellent mobility and maneuverability, UAVs are employed to collect data from ground sensors in harsh environments, such as natural disaster monitoring, border surveillance, and emergency response monitoring. One major challenge in these scenarios is that the movements of UAVs affect channel conditions and result in packet loss. Fast movements of UAVs lead to poor channel conditions and rapid signal degradation, resulting in packet loss. On the other hand, slow mobility of a UAV can cause buffer overflows of the ground sensors, as newly arrived data is not promptly collected by the UAV. Our proposal to address this challenge is to minimize packet loss by jointly optimizing the velocity controls and data collection schedules of multiple UAVs.Furthermore, in UASNets, swift movements of UAVs result in poor channel conditions and fast signal attenuation, leading to an extended age of information (AoI). In contrast, slow movements of UAVs prolong flight time, thereby extending the AoI of ground sensors.To address this challenge, we propose a new mean-field flight resource allocation optimization to minimize the AoI of sensory data.

    "title": "Towards Architecture-Insensitive Untrained Network Priors for  Accelerated MRI Reconstruction",
    "abstract": "Untrained neural networks pioneered by Deep Image Prior (DIP) have recently enabled MRI reconstruction without requiring fully-sampled measurements for training. Their success is widely attributed to the implicit regularization induced by suitable network architectures. However, the lack of understanding of such architectural priors results in superfluous design choices and sub-optimal outcomes. This work aims to simplify the architectural design decisions for DIP-MRI to facilitate its practical deployment. We observe that certain architectural components are more prone to causing overfitting regardless of the number of parameters, incurring severe reconstruction artifacts by hindering accurate extrapolation on the un-acquired measurements. We interpret this phenomenon from a frequency perspective and find that the architectural characteristics favoring low frequencies, i.e., deep and narrow with unlearnt upsampling, can lead to enhanced generalization and hence better reconstruction. Building on this insight, we propose two architecture-agnostic remedies: one to constrain the frequency range of the white-noise input and the other to penalize the Lipschitz constants of the network. We demonstrate that even with just one extra line of code on the input, the performance gap between the ill-designed models and the high-performing ones can be closed. These results signify that for the first time, architectural biases on untrained MRI reconstruction can be mitigated without architectural modifications. ",
