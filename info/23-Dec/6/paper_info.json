    "abstract": "In the realm of 5G communication systems, the accuracy of Channel State Information (CSI) prediction is vital for optimizing performance. This letter introduces a pioneering approach: the Spectral-Temporal Graph Neural Network (STEM GNN), which fuses spatial relationships and temporal dynamics of the wireless channel using the Graph Fourier Transform. We compare the STEM GNN approach with conventional Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for CSI prediction. Our findings reveal a significant enhancement in overall communication system performance through STEM GNNs. For instance, in one scenario, STEM GNN achieves a sum rate of 5.009 bps/Hz which is $11.9\\%$ higher than that of LSTM and $35\\%$ higher than that of RNN. The spectral-temporal analysis capabilities of STEM GNNs capture intricate patterns often overlooked by traditional models, offering improvements in beamforming, interference mitigation, and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC).

    "abstract": "The A-channel is a noiseless multiple access channel in which users simultaneously transmit Q-ary symbols and the receiver observes the set of transmitted symbols, but not their multiplicities. An A-channel is said to be unsourced if, additionally, users transmissions are encoded across time using a common codebook and decoding of the transmitted messages is done without regard to the identities of the active users. An interesting variant of the unsourced A-channel is the unsourced A-channel with erasures (UACE), in which transmitted symbols are erased with a given independent and identically distributed probability. In this paper, we focus on designing a code that enables a list of transmitted codewords to be recovered despite the erasures of some of the transmitted symbols. To this end, we propose the linked-loop code (LLC), which uses parity bits to link each symbol to the previous M symbols in a tail-biting manner, i.e., the first symbols of the transmission are linked to the last ones. The decoding process occurs in two phases: the first phase decodes the codewords that do not suffer from any erasures, and the second phase attempts to recover the erased symbols using the available parities. We compare the performance of the LLC over the UACE with other codes in the literature and argue for the effectiveness of the construction. Our motivation for studying the UACE comes from its relevance in machine-type communication and coded compressed sensing. ",

    "abstract": "Perceptive mobile network (PMN) is an emerging concept for next-generation wireless networks capable of conducting integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). A major challenge for realizing high performance sensing in PMNs is how to deal with spatially separated asynchronous transceivers. Asynchronicity results in timing offsets (TOs) and carrier frequency offsets (CFOs), which further cause ambiguity in ranging and velocity sensing. Most existing algorithms mitigate TOs and CFOs based on the line-of-sight (LOS) propagation path between sensing transceivers. However, LOS paths may not exist in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a cooperation based joint active and passive sensing scheme for the non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios having asynchronous transceivers. This scheme relies on the cross-correlation cooperative sensing (CCCS) algorithm, which regards active sensing as a reference and mitigates TOs and CFOs by correlating active and passive sensing information. Another major challenge for realizing high performance sensing in PMNs is how to realize high accuracy angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation with low complexity. Correspondingly, we propose a low complexity AoA algorithm based on cooperative sensing, which comprises coarse AoA estimation and fine AoA estimation. Analytical and numerical simulation results verify the performance advantages of the proposed CCCS algorithm and the low complexity AoA estimation algorithm. ",

Classic methods for creating a human shape model register a surface template mesh to a database of 3D scans and use dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis, to learn a compact representation. While these shape models enable global shape modifications by correlating anthropometric measurements with the learned subspace, they only provide limited localized shape control. We instead register a volumetric anatomical template, consisting of skeleton bones and soft tissue, to the surface scans of the CAESAR database. We further enlarge our training data to the full Cartesian product of all skeletons and all soft tissues using physically plausible volumetric deformation transfer. This data is then used to learn an anatomically constrained volumetric human shape model in a self-supervised fashion. The resulting TailorMe model enables shape sampling, localized shape manipulation, and fast inference from given surface scans. ",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the mobility problem in extremely large antenna array (ELAA) communication systems. In order to account for the performance loss caused by the spherical wavefront of ELAA in the mobility scenario, we propose a wavefront transformation-based matrix pencil (WTMP) channel prediction method. In particular, we design a matrix to transform the spherical wavefront into a new wavefront, which is closer to the plane wave. We also design a time-frequency projection matrix to capture the time-varying path delay due to user movement. Furthermore, we adopt the matrix pencil (MP) method to estimate channel parameters. Our proposed WTMP method can mitigate the effect of near-field radiation when predicting future channels. Theoretical analysis shows that the designed matrix is asymptotically determined by the distance between the base station (BS) antenna array and the scatterers or the user when the number of BS antennas is large enough. For an ELAA communication system in the mobility scenario, we prove that the prediction error converges to zero with the increasing number of BS antennas. Simulation results demonstrate that our designed transform matrix efficiently mitigates the near-field effect, and that our proposed WTMP method can overcome the ELAA mobility challenge and approach the performance in stationary setting.

    "abstract": "As the demand for high-quality services proliferates, an innovative network architecture, the fully-decoupled RAN (FD-RAN), has emerged for more flexible spectrum resource utilization and lower network costs. However, with the decoupling of uplink base stations and downlink base stations in FD-RAN, the traditional transmission mechanism, which relies on real-time channel feedback, is not suitable as the receiver is not able to feedback accurate and timely channel state information to the transmitter. This paper proposes a novel transmission scheme without relying on physical layer channel feedback. Specifically, we design a radio map based complex-valued precoding network~(RMCPNet) model, which outputs the base station precoding based on user location. RMCPNet comprises multiple subnets, with each subnet responsible for extracting unique modal features from diverse input modalities. Furthermore, the multi-modal embeddings derived from these distinct subnets are integrated within the information fusion layer, culminating in a unified representation. We also develop a specific RMCPNet training algorithm that employs the negative spectral efficiency as the loss function. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme on the public DeepMIMO dataset and show that RMCPNet can achieve 16\\% and 76\\% performance improvements over the conventional real-valued neural network and statistical codebook approach, respectively.

An intriguing but underexplored problem with existing text-to-3D methods is that 3D models obtained from the sampling-by-optimization procedure tend to have mode collapses, and hence poor diversity in their results. In this paper, we provide an analysis and identify potential causes of such a limited diversity, and then devise a new method that considers the joint generation of different 3D models from the same text prompt, where we propose to use augmented text prompts via textual inversion of reference images to diversify the joint generation.

Towards improved data-centric methods for cleaning real world vision datasets, we first conduct more than 200 experiments carefully benchmarking recently developed automated mislabel detection methods on multiple datasets under a variety of synthetic and real noise settings with varying noise levels. We compare these methods to a Simple and Efficient Mislabel Detector (SEMD) that we craft, and find that SEMD performs similarly to or outperforms prior mislabel detection approaches. We then apply SEMD to multiple real world computer vision datasets and test how dataset size, mislabel removal strategy, and mislabel removal amount further affect model performance after retraining on the cleaned data. With careful design of the approach, we find that mislabel removal leads per-class performance improvements of up to 8% of a retrained classifier in smaller data regimes. ",

    "abstract": "Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables training performant models using limited labeled data. One of the pillars underlying vision SSL is the use of data augmentations/perturbations of the input which do not significantly alter its semantic content. For audio and other temporal signals, augmentations are commonly used alongside format transforms such as Fourier transforms or wavelet transforms. Unlike augmentations, format transforms do not change the information contained in the data; rather, they express the same information in different coordinates. In this paper, we study the effects of format transforms and augmentations both separately and together on vision SSL. We define augmentations in frequency space called Fourier Domain Augmentations (FDA) and show that training SSL models on a combination of these and image augmentations can improve the downstream classification accuracy by up to 1.3% on ImageNet-1K. We also show improvements against SSL baselines in few-shot and transfer learning setups using FDA. Surprisingly, we also observe that format transforms can improve the quality of learned representations even without augmentations; however, the combination of the two techniques yields better quality.

However, the transferability of adversarial examples on semantic segmentation has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we propose an effective two-stage adversarial attack strategy to improve the transferability of adversarial examples on semantic segmentation, dubbed TranSegPGD. Specifically, at the first stage, every pixel in an input image is divided into different branches based on its adversarial property. Different branches are assigned different weights for optimization to improve the adversarial performance of all pixels.We assign high weights to the loss of the hard-to-attack pixels to misclassify all pixels. At the second stage, the pixels are divided into different branches based on their transferable property which is dependent on Kullback-Leibler divergence. Different branches are assigned different weights for optimization to improve the transferability of the adversarial examples. We assign high weights to the loss of the high-transferability pixels to improve the transferability of adversarial examples. Extensive experiments with various segmentation models are conducted on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a significant trend in deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly transformer-based models, of developing ever-larger and more capable models. While they demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, their growing scale requires increased computational resources (e.g., GPUs with greater memory capacity). To address this problem, quantization techniques (i.e., low-bit-precision representation and matrix multiplication) have been proposed. Most quantization techniques employ a static strategy in which the model parameters are quantized, either during training or inference, without considering the test-time sample. In contrast, dynamic quantization techniques, which have become increasingly popular, adapt during inference based on the input provided, while maintaining full-precision performance. However, their dynamic behavior and average-case performance assumption makes them vulnerable to a novel threat vector -- adversarial attacks that target the model's efficiency and availability. In this paper, we present QuantAttack, a novel attack that targets the availability of quantized models, slowing down the inference, and increasing memory usage and energy consumption. We show that carefully crafted adversarial examples, which are designed to exhaust the resources of the operating system, can trigger worst-case performance. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on vision transformers on a wide range of tasks, both uni-modal and multi-modal. We also examine the effect of different attack variants (e.g., a universal perturbation) and the transferability between different models. ",

Furthermore, LGPN incorporates a learnable pooling-unpooling mechanism tailored to model parsing, which adaptively learns hyperparameter dependencies of GMs used to generate the input image.

This is due to their requirement to output the full adjacency matrices whose size grows quadratically with the number of nodes. In response to this challenge, we introduce a new, simple, and scalable graph representation named gap encoded edge list (GEEL) that has a small representation size that aligns with the number of edges. In addition, GEEL significantly reduces the vocabulary size by incorporating the gap encoding and bandwidth restriction schemes. GEEL can be autoregressively generated with the incorporation of node positional encoding, and we further extend GEEL to deal with attributed graphs by designing a new grammar. Our findings reveal that the adoption of this compact representation not only enhances scalability but also bolsters performance by simplifying the graph generation process.

    "abstract": "Adversarial training (AT) is an important and attractive topic in deep learning security, exhibiting mysteries and odd properties. Recent studies of neural network training dynamics based on Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) make it possible to reacquaint AT and deeply analyze its properties. In this paper, we perform an in-depth investigation of AT process and properties with NTK, such as NTK evolution. We uncover three new findings that are missed in previous works. First, we disclose the impact of data normalization on AT and the importance of unbiased estimators in batch normalization layers. Second, we experimentally explore the kernel dynamics and propose more time-saving AT methods. Third, we study the spectrum feature inside the kernel to address the catastrophic overfitting problem. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work leveraging the observations of kernel dynamics to improve existing AT methods. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial examples are one of the most severe threats to deep learning models. Numerous works have been proposed to study and defend adversarial examples. However, these works lack analysis of adversarial information or perturbation, which cannot reveal the mystery of adversarial examples and lose proper interpretation. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by studying adversarial information as unstructured noise, which does not have a clear pattern. Specifically, we provide some empirical studies with singular value decomposition, by decomposing images into several matrices, to analyze adversarial information for different attacks. Based on the analysis, we propose a new module to regularize adversarial information and combine information bottleneck theory, which is proposed to theoretically restrict intermediate representations. Therefore, our method is interpretable. Moreover, the fashion of our design is a novel principle that is general and unified. Equipped with our new module, we evaluate two popular model structures on two mainstream datasets with various adversarial attacks. The results indicate that the improvement in robust accuracy is significant. On the other hand, we prove that our method is efficient with only a few additional parameters and able to be explained under regional faithfulness analysis. ",

The obtained chart locations can be seen as low-dimensional compressed versions of channel state information that can be used for a wide variety of applications, including beam prediction. In non-standalone or cell-free systems, chart locations computed at a given base station can be transmitted to several other base stations (possibly operating at different frequency bands) for them to predict which beams to use. This potentially yields a dramatic reduction of the overhead due to channel estimation or beam management, since only the base station performing charting requires channel state information, the others directly predicting the beam from the chart location. In this paper, advanced model-based neural network architectures are proposed for both channel charting and beam prediction.

However, most of the previous techniques only consider the first-order dependencies among blocks, which is insufficient in describing complex flow patterns. In this work, we present FlowHON, an approach to construct higher-order networks (HONs) from flow fields. FlowHON captures the inherent higher-order dependencies in flow fields as nodes and estimates the transitions among them as edges. We formulate the HON construction as an optimization problem with three linear transformations. The first two layers correspond to the node generation and the third one corresponds to edge estimation. Our formulation allows the node generation and edge estimation to be solved in a unified framework. With FlowHON, the rich set of traditional graph algorithms can be applied without any modification to analyze flow fields, while leveraging the higher-order information to understand the inherent structure and manage flow data for efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FlowHON using a series of downstream tasks, including estimating the density of particles during tracing, partitioning flow fields for data management, and understanding flow fields using the node-link diagram representation of networks.

Their optimization suffers from shape-radiance ambiguities wherever only a small visual overlap is available. This leads to erroneous scene geometry and artifacts. In this paper, we propose Re-Nerfing, a simple and general multi-stage approach that leverages NeRF's own view synthesis to address these limitations. With Re-Nerfing, we increase the scene's coverage and enhance the geometric consistency of novel views as follows: First, we train a NeRF with the available views. Then, we use the optimized NeRF to synthesize pseudo-views next to the original ones to simulate a stereo or trifocal setup. Finally, we train a second NeRF with both original and pseudo views while enforcing structural, epipolar constraints via the newly synthesized images. Extensive experiments on the mip-NeRF 360 dataset show the effectiveness of Re-Nerfing across denser and sparser input scenarios, bringing improvements to the state-of-the-art Zip-NeRF, even when trained with all views.

Climate-smart agricultural technologies are being developed to boost yields while decreasing operating expenses. Crop yield prediction, on the other hand, is difficult because of the complex and nonlinear impacts of cultivar, soil type, management, pest and disease, climate, and weather patterns on crops. To solve this issue, we employ machine learning (ML) to forecast production while considering climate change, soil diversity, cultivar, and inorganic nitrogen levels. From the 1980s to the 1990s, field data were gathered across the southern cotton belt of the United States. To capture the most current effects of climate change over the previous six years, a second data source was produced using the process-based crop model, GOSSYM. We concentrated our efforts on three distinct areas inside each of the three southern states: Texas, Mississippi, and Georgia. To simplify the amount of computations, accumulated heat units (AHU) for each set of experimental data were employed as an analogy to use time-series weather data. The Random Forest Regressor yielded a 97.75% accuracy rate, with a root mean square error of 55.05 kg/ha and an R2 of around 0.98. These findings demonstrate how an ML technique may be developed and applied as a reliable and easy-to-use model to support the cotton climate-smart initiative. ",

This issue severely limits the application of KG-based QA in real-world scenarios. However, it is non-trivial to solve due to two challenges: First, annotations of reasoning chains of multi-hop questions, which could serve as supervision for explanation generation, are usually lacking. Second, it is difficult to maintain high efficiency when explicit KG triples need to be retrieved to generate explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network-based Two-Step Reasoning model (GNN2R) to solve this issue. GNN2R can provide both final answers and reasoning subgraphs as a rationale behind final answers efficiently with only weak supervision that is available through question-final answer pairs. We extensively evaluated GNN2R with detailed analyses in experiments. The results demonstrate that, in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and quality of generated explanations, GNN2R outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods that are applicable to this task.

These modern arrestment systems rely on various mechanisms to absorb energy from an aircraft during an arrestment cycle to bring the aircraft to a full stop. One of the primary components of this system is the cable interface to the engine. The formation of slack in the cable at this interface can result in reduced efficiency and drives maintenance efforts to remove the slack prior to continued operations. In this paper, a machine vision based slack detection system is presented. A situational awareness camera is utilized to collect video data of the cable interface region, machine vision algorithms are applied to reduce noise, remove background clutter, focus on regions of interest, and detect changes in the image representative of slack formations. Some algorithms employed in this system include bilateral image filters, least squares polynomial fit, Canny Edge Detection, K-Means clustering, Gaussian Mixture-based Background/Foreground Segmentation for background subtraction, Hough Circle Transforms, and Hough line Transforms. The resulting detections are filtered and highlighted to create an indication to the shipboard operator of the presence of slack and a need for a maintenance action. A user interface was designed to provide operators with an easy method to redefine regions of interest and adjust the methods to specific locations. The algorithms were validated on shipboard footage and were able to accurately identify slack with minimal false positives. ",

Typically, this works in rounds alternating between parallel local training at several clients, followed by model aggregation at a server. We found that existing FL methods under-perform when local datasets are small and present severe label skew as these lead to over-fitting and local model bias. This is a realistic setting in many real-world applications. To address the problem, we propose \\textit{FLea}, a unified framework that tackles over-fitting and local bias by encouraging clients to exchange privacy-protected features to aid local training. The features refer to activations from an intermediate layer of the model, which are obfuscated before being shared with other clients to protect sensitive information in the data. \\textit{FLea} leverages a novel way of combining local and shared features as augmentations to enhance local model learning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that \\textit{FLea} outperforms the start-of-the-art FL methods, sharing only model parameters, by up to $17.6\\%$, and FL methods that share data augmentations by up to $6.3\\%$, while reducing the privacy vulnerability associated with shared data augmentations.

As a consequence, they appear in a variety of sensing/actuation applications, from smart personal spaces to complex industrial control systems and safety-critical medical equipment. While many of these devices perform safety- and time-critical tasks, they often lack support for security features compatible with their importance to overall system functions. This lack of architectural support leaves them vulnerable to run-time attacks that can remotely alter their intended behavior, with potentially catastrophic consequences. In particular, we note that MCU software often includes untrusted third-party libraries (some of them closed-source) that are blindly used within MCU programs, without proper isolation from the rest of the system. In turn, a single vulnerability (or intentional backdoor) in one such third-party software can often compromise the entire MCU software state. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing, demonstrating security, and formally verifying the implementation of UCCA: an Untrusted Code Compartment Architecture. UCCA provides flexible hardware-enforced isolation of untrusted code sections (e.g., third-party software modules) in resource-constrained and time-critical MCUs. To demonstrate UCCA's practicality, we implement an open-source version of the design on a real resource-constrained MCU: the well-known TI MSP430. Our evaluation shows that UCCA incurs little overhead and is affordable even to lowest-end MCUs, requiring significantly less overhead and assumptions than prior related work. ",

Probabilistic NeRF methods have tried to address this, but their output probabilities are not typically accurately calibrated, and therefore do not capture the true confidence levels of the model. Calibration is a particularly challenging problem in the sparse-view setting, where additional held-out data is unavailable for fitting a calibrator that generalizes to the test distribution. In this paper, we introduce the first method for obtaining calibrated uncertainties from NeRF models. Our method is based on a robust and efficient metric to calculate per-pixel uncertainties from the predictive posterior distribution. We propose two techniques that eliminate the need for held-out data. The first, based on patch sampling, involves training two NeRF models for each scene. The second is a novel meta-calibrator that only requires the training of one NeRF model. Our proposed approach for obtaining calibrated uncertainties achieves state-of-the-art uncertainty in the sparse-view setting while maintaining image quality. We further demonstrate our method's effectiveness in applications such as view enhancement and next-best view selection. ",

This introduces a challenging problem called SLAM with sparse sensing. This work addresses the problem by adopting the form of the state-of-the-art graph-based SLAM pipeline with a novel frontend and an improvement for loop closing in the backend, both of which are designed to work with sparse and uncertain range data. Experiments show that the maps constructed by our algorithm have superior quality compared to prior works on sparse sensing.

We overcome these problems with a simple representation that aggregates point clouds at multiple scale levels with sparse voxel grids at different resolutions. To deal with point cloud sparsity, we average across multiple scale levels -- but only among those that are valid, i.e., that have enough neighboring points in proximity to the ray of a pixel. To help model areas without points, we add a global voxel at the coarsest scale, thus unifying \"classical\" and point-based NeRF formulations.

    "abstract": "This work presents an algorithm for scene change detection from point clouds to enable autonomous robotic caretaking in future space habitats. Autonomous robotic systems will help maintain future deep-space habitats, such as the Gateway space station, which will be uncrewed for extended periods. Existing scene analysis software used on the International Space Station (ISS) relies on manually-labeled images for detecting changes. In contrast, the algorithm presented in this work uses raw, unlabeled point clouds as inputs. The algorithm first applies modified Expectation-Maximization Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering to two input point clouds. It then performs change detection by comparing the GMMs using the Earth Mover's Distance. The algorithm is validated quantitatively and qualitatively using a test dataset collected by an Astrobee robot in the NASA Ames Granite Lab comprising single frame depth images taken directly by Astrobee and full-scene reconstructed maps built with RGB-D and pose data from Astrobee. The runtimes of the approach are also analyzed in depth. The source code is publicly released to promote further development. ",

    "abstract": "DP-SGD has emerged as a popular method to protect personally identifiable information in deep learning applications. Unfortunately, DP-SGD's per-sample gradient clipping and uniform noise addition during training can significantly degrade model utility. To enhance the model's utility, researchers proposed various adaptive DP-SGD methods. However, we examine and discover that these techniques result in greater privacy leakage or lower accuracy than the traditional DP-SGD method, or a lack of evaluation on a complex data set such as CIFAR100. To address these limitations, we propose an Auto DP-SGD. Our method automates clipping threshold estimation based on the DL model's gradient norm and scales the gradients of each training sample without losing gradient information. This helps to improve the algorithm's utility while using a less privacy budget. To further improve accuracy, we introduce automatic noise multiplier decay mechanisms to decrease the noise multiplier after every epoch. Finally, we develop closed-form mathematical expressions using tCDP accountant for automatic noise multiplier and automatic clipping threshold estimation. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that Auto DP-SGD outperforms existing SOTA DP-SGD methods in privacy and accuracy on various benchmark datasets. We also show that privacy can be improved by lowering the scale factor and using learning rate schedulers without significantly reducing accuracy. Specifically, Auto DP-SGD, when used with a step noise multiplier, improves accuracy by 3.20, 1.57, 6.73, and 1.42 for the MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and AG News Corpus datasets, respectively. Furthermore, it obtains a substantial reduction in the privacy budget of 94.9, 79.16, 67.36, and 53.37 for the corresponding data sets. ",

    "abstract": "Multifunctional metamaterials (MMM) bear promise as next-generation material platforms supporting miniaturization and customization. Despite many proof-of-concept demonstrations and the proliferation of deep learning assisted design, grand challenges of inverse design for MMM, especially those involving heterogeneous fields possibly subject to either mutual meta-atom coupling or long-range interactions, remain largely under-explored. To this end, we present a data-driven design framework, which streamlines the inverse design of MMMs involving heterogeneous fields. A core enabler is implicit Fourier neural operator (IFNO), which predicts heterogeneous fields distributed across a metamaterial array, thus in general at odds with homogenization assumptions, in a parameter-/sample-efficient fashion. Additionally, we propose a standard formulation of inverse problem covering a broad class of MMMs, and gradient-based multitask concurrent optimization identifying a set of Pareto-optimal architecture-stimulus (A-S) pairs. Fourier multiclass blending is proposed to synthesize inter-class meta-atoms anchored on a set of geometric motifs, while enjoying training-free dimension reduction and built-it reconstruction. Interlocking the three pillars, the framework is validated for light-bylight programmable plasmonic nanoantenna, whose design involves vast space jointly spanned by quasi-freeform supercells, maneuverable incident phase distributions, and conflicting figure-of-merits involving on-demand localization patterns. Accommodating all the challenges without a-priori simplifications, our framework could propel future advancements of MMM. ",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the clustering of data in the hyperdimensional computing (HDC) domain. In prior work, an HDC-based clustering framework, referred to as HDCluster, has been proposed. However, the performance of the existing HDCluster is not robust. The performance of HDCluster is degraded as the hypervectors for the clusters are chosen at random during the initialization step. To overcome this bottleneck, we assign the initial cluster hypervectors by exploring the similarity of the encoded data, referred to as \\textit{query} hypervectors. Intra-cluster hypervectors have a higher similarity than inter-cluster hypervectors. Harnessing the similarity results among query hypervectors, this paper proposes four HDC-based clustering algorithms: similarity-based k-means, equal bin-width histogram, equal bin-height histogram, and similarity-based affinity propagation. Experimental results illustrate that: (i) Compared to the existing HDCluster, our proposed HDC-based clustering algorithms can achieve better accuracy, more robust performance, fewer iterations, and less execution time. Similarity-based affinity propagation outperforms the other three HDC-based clustering algorithms on eight datasets by 2~38% in clustering accuracy. (ii) Even for one-pass clustering, i.e., without any iterative update of the cluster hypervectors, our proposed algorithms can provide more robust clustering accuracy than HDCluster. (iii) Over eight datasets, five out of eight can achieve higher or comparable accuracy when projected onto the hyperdimensional space. Traditional clustering is more desirable than HDC when the number of clusters, $k$, is large. ",

Our work focuses on using embeddings to identify and remove \"low-quality\" code data. First, we explore features of \"low-quality\" code in embedding space, through the use of synthetic corruptions. Armed with this knowledge, we devise novel pruning metrics that operate in embedding space to identify and remove low-quality entries in the Stack dataset. We demonstrate the benefits of this synthetic corruption informed pruning (SCIP) approach on the well-established HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, outperforming existing embedding-based methods. Importantly, we achieve up to a 3% performance improvement over no pruning, thereby showing the promise of insights from synthetic corruptions for data pruning. ",

To evaluate the reasoning capability of Lenna, we construct a ReasonDet dataset to measure its performance on reasoning-based detection. Remarkably, Lenna demonstrates outstanding performance on ReasonDet and comes with significantly low training costs. It also incurs minimal transferring overhead when extended to other tasks.

By initializing the bias of the neural network within different ranges, sub-functions with various frequencies in the variable-periodic function are selected for activation. Consequently, the supported frequency set of FINER can be flexibly tuned, leading to improved performance in signal representation. We demonstrate the capabilities of FINER in the contexts of 2D image fitting, 3D signed distance field representation, and 5D neural radiance fields optimization, and we show that it outperforms existing INRs.

GDN uses stacking of different networks to enhance the model performance. Specifically, GDN consists of two sequential levels in its structure. The first level performs basic classification tasks accomplished by GoogLeNet and DenseNet, which are trained in parallel to enhance efficiency. To avoid low accuracy and long training time, the second level takes the output of the GoogLeNet and DenseNet as the input for a logistic regression model. We compare our method with four baseline networks including ResNet, VGGNet, DenseNet, and GoogLeNet on the dataset, in which GoogLeNet and DenseNet significantly outperform ResNet and VGGNet. In the second level, different stacking methods such as perceptron, logistic regression, SVM, decision trees and K-neighbor are studied in which Logistic Regression shows the best prediction result among all. The results prove that GDN, compared to a single network structure, has higher accuracy in optimizing skin cancer detection. ",

The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) has recently been used to estimate the absolute 3D position of outdoor mobile robots. However, since the accuracy of GNSS single-point positioning is only a few meters, the GNSS is not used for the loop closure of a pose graph. The main purpose of this study is to generate a loop closure of a pose graph using a time-relative real-time kinematic GNSS (TR-RTK-GNSS) technique. The proposed TR-RTK-GNSS technique uses time-differential carrier phase positioning, which is based on carrier-phase-based differential GNSS with a single GNSS receiver. Unlike a conventional RTK-GNSS, we can directly compute the robot's relative position using only a stand-alone GNSS receiver. The initial pose graph is generated from the accumulated velocity computed from GNSS Doppler measurements. To reduce the accumulated error of velocity, we use the TR-RTK-GNSS technique for the loop closure in the graph-based optimization framework. The kinematic positioning tests were performed using an unmanned aerial vehicle to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique. From the tests, we can estimate the vehicle's trajectory with approximately 3 cm accuracy using only a stand-alone GNSS receiver. ",

However, the high-dimensional spatial-temporal data of a complex combustion system typically poses considerable challenges to the dynamical mode recognition. Based on a two-layer bidirectional long short-term memory variational autoencoder (Bi-LSTM-VAE) dimensionality reduction model and a two-dimensional Wasserstein distance-based classifier (WDC), this study proposes a promising method (Bi-LSTM-VAE-WDC) for recognizing dynamical modes in oscillatory combustion systems. Specifically, the Bi-LSTM-VAE dimension reduction model was introduced to reduce the high-dimensional spatial-temporal data of the combustion system to a low-dimensional phase space; Gaussian kernel density estimates (GKDE) were computed based on the distribution of phase points in a grid; two-dimensional WD values were calculated from the GKDE maps to recognize the oscillation modes. The time-series data used in this study were obtained from numerical simulations of circular arrays of laminar flame oscillators. The results show that the novel Bi-LSTM-VAE method can produce a non-overlapping distribution of phase points, indicating an effective unsupervised mode recognition and classification. Furthermore, the present method exhibits a more prominent performance than VAE and PCA (principal component analysis) for distinguishing dynamical modes in complex flame systems, implying its potential in studying turbulent combustion.

    "abstract": "Existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) training frameworks have been designed to help developers easily create performant GNN implementations. However, most existing GNN frameworks assume that the input graphs are static, but ignore that most real-world graphs are constantly evolving. Though many dynamic GNN models have emerged to learn from evolving graphs, the training process of these dynamic GNNs is dramatically different from traditional GNNs in that it captures both the spatial and temporal dependencies of graph updates. This poses new challenges for designing dynamic GNN training frameworks. First, the traditional batched training method fails to capture real-time structural evolution information. Second, the time-dependent nature makes parallel training hard to design. Third, it lacks system supports for users to efficiently implement dynamic GNNs. In this paper, we present NeutronStream, a framework for training dynamic GNN models. NeutronStream abstracts the input dynamic graph into a chronologically updated stream of events and processes the stream with an optimized sliding window to incrementally capture the spatial-temporal dependencies of events. Furthermore, NeutronStream provides a parallel execution engine to tackle the sequential event processing challenge to achieve high performance. NeutronStream also integrates a built-in graph storage structure that supports dynamic updates and provides a set of easy-to-use APIs that allow users to express their dynamic GNNs. Our experimental results demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art dynamic GNN implementations, NeutronStream achieves speedups ranging from 1.48X to 5.87X and an average accuracy improvement of 3.97%.

Direct three-dimensional (3D) mapping using a small-sized UAV equipped with a laser scanner is required for numerous remote sensing applications. In direct 3D mapping, the precise information about the position and attitude of the UAV is necessary for constructing 3D maps. In this study, we propose a novel and robust technique for estimating the position and attitude of small-sized UAVs by employing multiple low-cost and light-weight global navigation satellite system (GNSS) antennas/receivers. Using the \"redundancy\" of multiple GNSS receivers, we enhance the performance of real-time kinematic (RTK)-GNSS by employing single-frequency GNSS receivers. This method consists of two approaches: hybrid GNSS fix solutions and consistency examination of the GNSS signal strength. The fix rate of RTK-GNSS using single-frequency GNSS receivers can be highly enhanced to combine multiple RTK-GNSS to fix solutions in the multiple antennas. In addition, positioning accuracy and fix rate can be further enhanced to detect multipath signals by using multiple GNSS antennas. In this study, we developed a prototype UAV that is equipped with six GNSS antennas/receivers. From the static test results, we conclude that the proposed technique can enhance the accuracy of the position and attitude estimation in multipath environments.

However, the IDSs for IoT devices face inherent challenges of IoT systems, including the heterogeneity of IoT data/devices, the high dimensionality of training data, and the imbalanced data. Moreover, the deployment of IDSs on IoT systems is challenging, and sometimes impossible, due to the limited resources such as memory/storage and computing capability of typical IoT devices. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a novel deep neural network/architecture called Constrained Twin Variational Auto-Encoder (CTVAE) that can feed classifiers of IDSs with more separable/distinguishable and lower-dimensional representation data. Additionally, in comparison to the state-of-the-art neural networks used in IDSs, CTVAE requires less memory/storage and computing power, hence making it more suitable for IoT IDS systems. Extensive experiments with the 11 most popular IoT botnet datasets show that CTVAE can boost around 1% in terms of accuracy and Fscore in detection attack compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning and representation learning methods, whilst the running time for attack detection is lower than 2E-6 seconds and the model size is lower than 1 MB. We also further investigate various characteristics of CTVAE in the latent space and in the reconstruction representation to demonstrate its efficacy compared with current well-known methods. ",

    "abstract": "The incorporation of advanced sensors and machine learning techniques has enabled modern manufacturing enterprises to perform data-driven in-situ quality monitoring based on the sensor data collected in manufacturing processes. However, one critical challenge is that newly presented defect category may manifest as the manufacturing process continues, resulting in monitoring performance deterioration of previously trained machine learning models. Hence, there is an increasing need for empowering machine learning model to learn continually. Among all continual learning methods, memory-based continual learning has the best performance but faces the constraints of data storage capacity. To address this issue, this paper develops a novel pseudo replay-based continual learning by integrating class incremental learning and oversampling-based data generation. Without storing all the data, the developed framework could generate high-quality data representing previous classes to train machine learning model incrementally when new category anomaly occurs. In addition, it could even enhance the monitoring performance since it also effectively improves the data quality. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in an additive manufacturing process, which leverages supervised classification problem for anomaly detection. The experimental results show that the developed method is very promising in detecting novel anomaly while maintaining a good performance on the previous task and brings up more flexibility in model architecture.

    "abstract": "Gradient compression alleviates expensive communication in distributed deep learning by sending fewer values and its corresponding indices, typically via Allgather (AG). Training with high compression ratio (CR) achieves high accuracy like DenseSGD, but has lower parallel scaling due to high communication cost (i.e., parallel efficiency). Using lower CRs improves parallel efficiency by lowering synchronization cost, but degrades model accuracy as well (statistical efficiency). Further, speedup attained with different models and CRs also varies with network latency, effective bandwidth and collective op used for aggregation. In many cases, collectives like Allreduce (AR) have lower cost than AG to exchange the same amount of data. In this paper, we propose an AR-compatible Topk compressor that is bandwidth-optimal and thus performs better than AG in certain network configurations. We develop a flexible communication strategy that switches between AG and AR based on which collective is optimal in the current settings, and model the pareto-relationship between parallel and statistical efficiency as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem to dynamically adjust CR and accelerate training while still converging to high accuracy.

In this study, we introduce VertiSim, an advanced event-driven simulator developed to evaluate e-VTOL transportation networks. Uniquely, VertiSim simultaneously models passenger, aircraft, and energy flows, reflecting the interrelated complexities of UAM systems. We utilized VertiSim to assess 19 operational scenarios serving a daily demand for 2,834 passengers with varying fleet sizes and vertiport distances. The study aims to support stakeholders in making informed decisions about fleet size, network design, and infrastructure development by understanding tradeoffs in passenger delay time, operational costs, and fleet utilization. Our simulations, guided by a heuristic dispatch and charge policy, indicate that fleet size significantly influences passenger delay and energy consumption within UAM networks. We find that increasing the fleet size can reduce average passenger delays, but this comes at the cost of higher operational expenses due to an increase in the number of repositioning flights. Additionally, our analysis highlights how vertiport distances impact fleet utilization: longer distances result in reduced total idle time and increased cruise and charge times, leading to more efficient fleet utilization but also longer passenger delays. These findings are important for UAM network planning, especially in balancing fleet size with vertiport capacity and operational costs.

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel direct Audio-Visual Speech to Audio-Visual Speech Translation (AV2AV) framework, where the input and output of the system are multimodal (i.e., audio and visual speech). With the proposed AV2AV, two key advantages can be brought: 1) We can perform real-like conversations with individuals worldwide in a virtual meeting by utilizing our own primary languages. In contrast to Speech-to-Speech Translation (A2A), which solely translates between audio modalities, the proposed AV2AV directly translates between audio-visual speech. This capability enhances the dialogue experience by presenting synchronized lip movements along with the translated speech. 2) We can improve the robustness of the spoken language translation system. By employing the complementary information of audio-visual speech, the system can effectively translate spoken language even in the presence of acoustic noise, showcasing robust performance. To mitigate the problem of the absence of a parallel AV2AV translation dataset, we propose to train our spoken language translation system with the audio-only dataset of A2A. This is done by learning unified audio-visual speech representations through self-supervised learning in advance to train the translation system. Moreover, we propose an AV-Renderer that can generate raw audio and video in parallel. It is designed with zero-shot speaker modeling, thus the speaker in source audio-visual speech can be maintained at the target translated audio-visual speech. The effectiveness of AV2AV is evaluated with extensive experiments in a many-to-many language translation setting. The demo page is available on https://choijeongsoo.github.io/av2av. ",

To address this issue, we propose the MEMTO, a memory-guided Transformer using a reconstruction-based approach.

To stabilize the training procedure, we use a two-phase training paradigm which involves using K-means clustering for initializing memory items. Additionally, we introduce a bi-dimensional deviation-based detection criterion that calculates anomaly scores considering both input space and latent space. We evaluate our proposed method on five real-world datasets from diverse domains, and it achieves an average anomaly detection F1-score of 95.74%, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art methods.

In addition, existing graph contrastive learning methods usually adopt the way of maximizing mutual information to keep the node representations consistent between different graph views, which may cause the model to learn task-independent redundant information. To tackle the above problems, this paper treats images as graph structures and introduces a simple contrastive vision GNN (SC-ViG) architecture for remote sensing segmentation. Specifically, we construct a node-masked and edge-masked graph view to obtain an optimal graph structure representation, which can adaptively learn whether to mask nodes and edges. Furthermore, this paper innovatively introduces information bottleneck theory into graph contrastive learning to maximize task-related information while minimizing task-independent redundant information. Finally, we replace the convolutional module in UNet with the SC-ViG module to complete the segmentation and classification tasks of remote sensing images. Extensive experiments on publicly available real datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art remote sensing image segmentation methods. ",

    "abstract": "Although vision models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) show impressive generalization performance, their zero-shot robustness is still limited under Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios without fine-tuning. Instead of undesirably providing human supervision as commonly done, it is possible to take advantage of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that hold powerful visual understanding abilities. However, MLLMs are shown to struggle with vision problems due to the incompatibility of tasks, thus hindering their utilization. In this paper, we propose to effectively leverage MLLMs to conduct Machine Vision Therapy which aims to rectify the noisy predictions from vision models. By fine-tuning with the denoised labels, the learning model performance can be boosted in an unsupervised manner. To solve the incompatibility issue, we propose a novel Denoising In-Context Learning (DICL) strategy to align vision tasks with MLLMs. Concretely, by estimating a transition matrix that captures the probability of one class being confused with another, an instruction containing a correct exemplar and an erroneous one from the most probable noisy class can be constructed. Such an instruction can help any MLLMs with ICL ability to detect and rectify incorrect predictions of vision models. Through extensive experiments on ImageNet, WILDS, DomainBed, and other OOD datasets, we carefully validate the quantitative and qualitative effectiveness of our method.

The proposed architecture operates less than 1 dB away from a baseline using linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimation with K-best detection but benefits from a significantly lower computational complexity. We show the importance of a carefully designed training process such that the trained receiver is universal for a wide range of different unseen channel conditions.

As in traditional adversarial learning, adv-ICL is implemented as a two-player game between the generator and discriminator, where the generator tries to generate realistic enough output to fool the discriminator. In each round, given an input prefixed by task instructions and several exemplars, the generator produces an output. The discriminator is then tasked with classifying the generator input-output pair as model-generated or real data. Based on the discriminator loss, the prompt modifier proposes possible edits to the generator and discriminator prompts, and the edits that most improve the adversarial loss are selected. We show that adv-ICL results in significant improvements over state-of-the-art prompt optimization techniques for both open and closed-source models on 11 generation and classification tasks including summarization, arithmetic reasoning, machine translation, data-to-text generation, and the MMLU and big-bench hard benchmarks. In addition, because our method uses pre-trained models and updates only prompts rather than model parameters, it is computationally efficient, easy to extend to any LLM and task, and effective in low-resource settings.

Since diffusion models have recently emerged as the de facto standard generative framework with surprising generation results, novelty detection via diffusion models has also gained much attention. Recent methods have mainly utilized the reconstruction property of in-distribution samples. However, they often suffer from detecting OOD samples that share similar background information to the in-distribution data. Based on our observation that diffusion models can \\emph{project} any sample to an in-distribution sample with similar background information, we propose \\emph{Projection Regret (PR)}, an efficient novelty detection method that mitigates the bias of non-semantic information. To be specific, PR computes the perceptual distance between the test image and its diffusion-based projection to detect abnormality. Since the perceptual distance often fails to capture semantic changes when the background information is dominant, we cancel out the background bias by comparing it against recursive projections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PR outperforms the prior art of generative-model-based novelty detection methods by a significant margin. ",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have displayed considerable promise in graph representation learning across various applications. The core learning process requires the initialization of model weight matrices within each GNN layer, which is typically accomplished via classic initialization methods such as Xavier initialization. However, these methods were originally motivated to stabilize the variance of hidden embeddings and gradients across layers of Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to avoid vanishing gradients and maintain steady information flow. In contrast, within the GNN context classical initializations disregard the impact of the input graph structure and message passing on variance. In this paper, we analyze the variance of forward and backward propagation across GNN layers and show that the variance instability of GNN initializations comes from the combined effect of the activation function, hidden dimension, graph structure and message passing. To better account for these influence factors, we propose a new initialization method for Variance Instability Reduction within GNN Optimization (Virgo), which naturally tends to equate forward and backward variances across successive layers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on 15 datasets to show that Virgo can lead to superior model performance and more stable variance at initialization on node classification, link prediction and graph classification tasks.

Our investigation has revealed that real and generated images display distinct latent Gaussian representations when subjected to an inverse diffusion process within a pre-trained diffusion model. Exploiting this disparity, we can amplify subtle artifacts in generated images. Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel image representation known as Diffusion Noise Feature (DNF). DNF is an ensemble representation that estimates the noise generated during the inverse diffusion process. A simple classifier, e.g., ResNet, trained on DNF achieves high accuracy, robustness, and generalization capabilities for detecting generated images, even from previously unseen classes or models.

Despite the significant strides made by graph-based networks in spatio-temporal forecasting, there remain two pivotal factors closely related to forecasting performance that need further consideration: time delays in propagation dynamics and multi-scale high-dimensional interactions. In this work, we present a Series-Aligned Multi-Scale Graph Learning (SAMSGL) framework, aiming to enhance forecasting performance. In order to handle time delays in spatial interactions, we propose a series-aligned graph convolution layer to facilitate the aggregation of non-delayed graph signals, thereby mitigating the influence of time delays for the improvement in accuracy. To understand global and local spatio-temporal interactions, we develop a spatio-temporal architecture via multi-scale graph learning, which encompasses two essential components: multi-scale graph structure learning and graph-fully connected (Graph-FC) blocks. The multi-scale graph structure learning includes a global graph structure to learn both delayed and non-delayed node embeddings, as well as a local one to learn node variations influenced by neighboring factors. The Graph-FC blocks synergistically fuse spatial and temporal information to boost prediction accuracy. To evaluate the performance of SAMSGL, we conduct experiments on meteorological and traffic forecasting datasets, which demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority. ",

On the other hand, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), despite having wider abilities than ANNs, have always presented a challenge in the training phase. This paper shows a new method to perform supervised learning on SNNs, using Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and homeostasis, aiming at training the network to identify spatial patterns. The method is tested using the SpiNNaker digital architecture. A SNN is trained to recognise one or multiple patterns and performance metrics are extracted to measure the performance of the network. Some considerations are drawn from the results showing that, in the case of a single trained pattern, the network behaves as the ideal detector, with 100% accuracy in detecting the trained pattern. However, as the number of trained patterns on a single network increases, the accuracy of the identification is linked to the similarities between these patterns. This method of training an SNN to detect spatial patterns may be applied on pattern recognition in static images or traffic analysis in computer networks, where each network packet represents a spatial pattern. It will be stipulated that the homeostatic factor may enable the network to detect patterns with some degree of similarities, rather than only perfectly matching patterns. ",

    "abstract": "Ensuring the reliability of power electronic converters is a matter of great importance, and data-driven condition monitoring techniques are cementing themselves as an important tool for this purpose. However, translating methods that work well in controlled lab environments to field applications presents significant challenges, notably because of the limited diversity and accuracy of the lab training data. By enabling the use of field data, online machine learning can be a powerful tool to overcome this problem, but it introduces additional challenges in ensuring the stability and predictability of the training processes. This work presents an edge computing method that mitigates these shortcomings with minimal additional memory usage, by employing an autonomous algorithm that prioritizes the storage of training samples with larger prediction errors. The method is demonstrated on the use case of a self-commissioning condition monitoring system, in the form of a thermal anomaly detection scheme for a variable frequency motor drive, where the algorithm self-learned to distinguish normal and anomalous operation with minimal prior knowledge. The obtained results, based on experimental data, show a significant improvement in prediction accuracy and training speed, when compared to equivalent models trained online without the proposed data selection process.

However, in real world applications observations can change or be missing entirely. Examples of this could be a light bulb breaking down, or the wallpaper in a certain room changing. While these situations change the actual observation, the underlying optimal policy does not change. Because of this we want our agent to continue taking actions until it receives a (recognized) observation again. To achieve this we introduce a combination of a neural network architecture that uses hidden representations of the observations and a novel n-step loss function. Our implementation is able to withstand location based blindness stretches longer than the ones it was trained on, and therefore shows robustness to temporary blindness.

    "abstract": "A backdoor attack in deep learning inserts a hidden backdoor in the model to trigger malicious behavior upon specific input patterns. Existing detection approaches assume a metric space (for either the original inputs or their latent representations) in which normal samples and malicious samples are separable. We show that this assumption has a severe limitation by introducing a novel SSDT (Source-Specific and Dynamic-Triggers) backdoor, which obscures the difference between normal samples and malicious samples. To overcome this limitation, we move beyond looking for a perfect metric space that would work for different deep-learning models, and instead resort to more robust topological constructs. We propose TED (Topological Evolution Dynamics) as a model-agnostic basis for robust backdoor detection. The main idea of TED is to view a deep-learning model as a dynamical system that evolves inputs to outputs. In such a dynamical system, a benign input follows a natural evolution trajectory similar to other benign inputs. In contrast, a malicious sample displays a distinct trajectory, since it starts close to benign samples but eventually shifts towards the neighborhood of attacker-specified target samples to activate the backdoor. Extensive evaluations are conducted on vision and natural language datasets across different network architectures. The results demonstrate that TED not only achieves a high detection rate, but also significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art detection approaches, particularly in addressing the sophisticated SSDT attack. The code to reproduce the results is made public on GitHub. ",

The advent of deep learning has aided numerous methods in SL recognition and translation, achieving remarkable results.

Most SLP methods rely on 2D data, thus impeding their ability to attain a necessary level of realism. In this work, we propose a diffusion-based SLP model trained on a curated large-scale dataset of 4D signing avatars and their corresponding text transcripts. The proposed method can generate dynamic sequences of 3D avatars from an unconstrained domain of discourse using a diffusion process formed on a novel and anatomically informed graph neural network defined on the SMPL-X body skeleton. Through a series of quantitative and qualitative experiments, we show that the proposed method considerably outperforms previous methods of SLP. We believe that this work presents an important and necessary step towards realistic neural sign avatars, bridging the communication gap between Deaf and hearing communities.

    "abstract": "A machine learning model is traditionally considered robust if its prediction remains (almost) constant under input perturbations with small norm. However, real-world tasks like molecular property prediction or point cloud segmentation have inherent equivariances, such as rotation or permutation equivariance. In such tasks, even perturbations with large norm do not necessarily change an input's semantic content. Furthermore, there are perturbations for which a model's prediction explicitly needs to change. For the first time, we propose a sound notion of adversarial robustness that accounts for task equivariance. We then demonstrate that provable robustness can be achieved by (1) choosing a model that matches the task's equivariances (2) certifying traditional adversarial robustness. Certification methods are, however, unavailable for many models, such as those with continuous equivariances. We close this gap by developing the framework of equivariance-preserving randomized smoothing, which enables architecture-agnostic certification. We additionally derive the first architecture-specific graph edit distance certificates, i.e. sound robustness guarantees for isomorphism equivariant tasks like node classification. Overall, a sound notion of robustness is an important prerequisite for future work at the intersection of robust and geometric machine learning. ",

Motivated by these advancements, this paper presents a novel dereverberation frame-work, which incorporates data-driven methods for capturing speech priors within the WPE framework.

    "abstract": "We explore a class of adversarial attacks targeting the activations of language models. By manipulating a relatively small subset of model activations, $a$, we demonstrate the ability to control the exact prediction of a significant number (in some cases up to 1000) of subsequent tokens $t$. We empirically verify a scaling law where the maximum number of target tokens $t_\\mathrm{max}$ predicted depends linearly on the number of tokens $a$ whose activations the attacker controls as $t_\\mathrm{max} = \\kappa a$. We find that the number of bits of control in the input space needed to control a single bit in the output space (what we call attack resistance $\\chi$) is remarkably constant between $\\approx 16$ and $\\approx 25$ over 2 orders of magnitude of model sizes for different language models. Compared to attacks on tokens, attacks on activations are predictably much stronger, however, we identify a surprising regularity where one bit of input steered either via activations or via tokens is able to exert control over a similar amount of output bits. This gives support for the hypothesis that adversarial attacks are a consequence of dimensionality mismatch between the input and output spaces. A practical implication of the ease of attacking language model activations instead of tokens is for multi-modal and selected retrieval models, where additional data sources are added as activations directly, sidestepping the tokenized input. This opens up a new, broad attack surface. By using language models as a controllable test-bed to study adversarial attacks, we were able to experiment with input-output dimensions that are inaccessible in computer vision, especially where the output dimension dominates.

Unfortunately, these tools can be exploited by malicious actors to integrate sensitive user information, posing cybersecurity risks. While many researchers have explored attacking SNA (ASNA) through a network modification attack way, practical feasibility remains a challenge. This paper introduces a novel approach, the node injection attack. To overcome the problem of modeling and solving within a limited time and balancing costs and benefits, we propose a low-cost, high-impact node injection attack via dynamic programming (DPNIA) framework. DPNIA models ASNA as a problem of maximizing the number of confirmed incorrect correspondent node pairs who have a greater similarity scores than the pairs between existing nodes, making ASNA solvable. Meanwhile, it employs a cross-network evaluation method to identify node vulnerability, facilitating a progressive attack from easy to difficult. Additionally, it utilizes an optimal injection strategy searching method, based on dynamic programming, to determine which links should be added between injected nodes and existing nodes, thereby achieving a high impact for attack effectiveness at a low cost. Experiments on four real-world datasets consistently demonstrate that DPNIA consistently and significantly outperforms various attack baselines. ",

Further, our approach enables the identification of pivotal nodes responsible for encoding these patterns, which may offer crucial insights for fine-tuning specific sub-networks for bias mitigation. We introduce two new scanning methods to handle LLM activations for anomalous sentences that may deviate from the expected distribution in either direction. Our results confirm prior findings of BERT's limited internal capacity for encoding hallucinations, while OPT appears capable of encoding hallucination information internally.

Using the latest state-of-the-art methods in neural IR, we research what helps to tackle this task more efficiently. Training retrieval models requires a lot of data, which is difficult to obtain for training in-domain. Therefore, we commence with training on a large amount of general domain data and then continue training on in-domain data. To handle the lack of in-domain data, we employed a data augmentation technique, which considerably improved results in MRR@10 and NDCG@5 metrics, setting the state-of-the-art in Qur'anic IR for both English and Arabic. The absence of an Islamic corpus and domain-specific model for IR task in English motivated us to address this lack of resources and take preliminary steps of the Islamic corpus compilation and domain-specific language model (LM) pre-training, which helped to improve the performance of the retrieval models that use the domain-specific LM as the shared backbone. We examined several language models (LMs) in Arabic to select one that efficiently deals with the Qur'anic IR task. Besides transferring successful experiments from English to Arabic, we conducted additional experiments with retrieval task in Arabic to amortize the scarcity of general domain datasets used to train the retrieval models.

    "abstract": "Stochastic networks and queueing systems often lead to Markov decision processes (MDPs) with large state and action spaces as well as nonconvex objective functions, which hinders the convergence of many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Policy-gradient methods perform well on MDPs with large state and action spaces, but they sometimes experience slow convergence due to the high variance of the gradient estimator. In this paper, we show that some of these difficulties can be circumvented by exploiting the structure of the underlying MDP. We first introduce a new family of gradient estimators called score-aware gradient estimators (SAGEs). When the stationary distribution of the MDP belongs to an exponential family parametrized by the policy parameters, SAGEs allow us to estimate the policy gradient without relying on value-function estimation, contrary to classical policy-gradient methods like actor-critic. To demonstrate their applicability, we examine two common control problems arising in stochastic networks and queueing systems whose stationary distributions have a product-form, a special case of exponential families. As a second contribution, we show that, under appropriate assumptions, the policy under a SAGE-based policy-gradient method has a large probability of converging to an optimal policy, provided that it starts sufficiently close to it, even with a nonconvex objective function and multiple maximizers. Our key assumptions are that, locally around a maximizer, a nondegeneracy property of the Hessian of the objective function holds and a Lyapunov function exists. Finally, we conduct a numerical comparison between a SAGE-based policy-gradient method and an actor-critic algorithm. The results demonstrate that the SAGE-based method finds close-to-optimal policies more rapidly, highlighting its superior performance over the traditional actor-critic method. ",

As they are highly dependent on the pre-set dense anchors and the NMS operation, the approach is indirect and suboptimal.The end-to-end DETR-based detectors have achieved great success in horizontal object detection and many other areas like segmentation, tracking, action recognition and etc.However, the DETR-based detectors perform poorly on dense rotated target tasks and perform worse than most modern CNN-based detectors. In this paper, we find the most significant reason for the poor performance is that the original attention can not accurately focus on the oriented targets. Accordingly, we propose Rotated object detection TRansformer (RotaTR) as an extension of DETR to oriented detection. Specifically, we design Rotation Sensitive deformable (RSDeform) attention to enhance the DETR's ability to detect oriented targets. It is used to build the feature alignment module and rotation-sensitive decoder for our model. We test RotaTR on four challenging-oriented benchmarks. It shows a great advantage in detecting dense and oriented objects compared to the original DETR. It also achieves competitive results when compared to the state-of-the-art. ",

We take advantage of these capacity-rich models to lower the cost of inference by exploiting computation in superposition. To reduce the computational burden per input, we propose Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output Neural Networks (MIMONets) capable of handling many inputs at once. MIMONets augment various deep neural network architectures with variable binding mechanisms to represent an arbitrary number of inputs in a compositional data structure via fixed-width distributed representations. Accordingly, MIMONets adapt nonlinear neural transformations to process the data structure holistically, leading to a speedup nearly proportional to the number of superposed input items in the data structure. After processing in superposition, an unbinding mechanism recovers each transformed input of interest. MIMONets also provide a dynamic trade-off between accuracy and throughput by an instantaneous on-demand switching between a set of accuracy-throughput operating points, yet within a single set of fixed parameters. We apply the concept of MIMONets to both CNN and Transformer architectures resulting in MIMOConv and MIMOFormer, respectively. Empirical evaluations show that MIMOConv achieves about 2-4 x speedup at an accuracy delta within [+0.68, -3.18]% compared to WideResNet CNNs on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Similarly, MIMOFormer can handle 2-4 inputs at once while maintaining a high average accuracy within a [-1.07, -3.43]% delta on the long range arena benchmark. Finally, we provide mathematical bounds on the interference between superposition channels in MIMOFormer. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/multiple-input-multiple-output-nets. ",

The design and implementation of electronic circuitry to amplify, filter, and digitize the seismic signals captured through geophones are presented. A collection of seismic infrasonic elephant rumbles was collected at a free-ranging area of an elephant orphanage in Sri Lanka. The seismic rumbles were converted to spectrograms, and several methods were used for spectral feature extraction. Using LasyPredict, the features extracted using different methods were fed into their corresponding machine-learning algorithms to train them for automatic seismic rumble identification. It was found that the Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) together with the Ridge classifier machine learning algorithm produced the best performance in identifying seismic elephant rumbles. A novel method for denoising the spectrum that leads to enhanced accuracy in identifying seismic rumbles is also presented. ",

Given the growing interest in deep learning methods for the physical sciences, we develop a machine learning-based approach to characterize ion transport across nanoporous membranes. Our proposed framework centers around attention-enhanced neural differential equations that incorporate electroneutrality-based inductive biases to improve generalization performance relative to conventional PDE-based methods. In addition, we study the role of the attention mechanism in illuminating physically-meaningful ion-pairing relationships across diverse mixture compositions. Further, we investigate the importance of pre-training on simulated data from PDE-based models, as well as the performance benefits from hard vs. soft inductive biases. Our results indicate that physics-informed deep learning solutions can outperform their classical PDE-based counterparts and provide promising avenues for modelling complex transport phenomena across diverse applications.

In this paper, we introduce a dynamic approach, widely utilized to improve network efficiency in computer vision tasks, to the point cloud registration task. We employ an iterative registration process on point cloud data multiple times to identify regions where matching points cluster, ultimately enabling us to remove noisy points. Specifically, we begin with deep global sampling to perform coarse global registration. Subsequently, we employ the proposed refined node proposal module to further narrow down the registration region and perform local registration. Furthermore, we utilize a spatial consistency-based classifier to evaluate the results of each registration stage. The model terminates once it reaches sufficient confidence, avoiding unnecessary computations. Extended experiments demonstrate that our model significantly reduces time consumption compared to other methods with similar results, achieving a speed improvement of over 41% on indoor dataset (3DMatch) and 33% on outdoor datasets (KITTI) while maintaining competitive registration recall requirements.

    "abstract": "Due to the advent and increase in the popularity of the Internet, people have been producing and disseminating textual data in several ways, such as reviews, social media posts, and news articles. As a result, numerous researchers have been working on discovering patterns in textual data, especially because social media posts function as social sensors, indicating peoples' opinions, interests, etc. However, most tasks regarding natural language processing are addressed using traditional machine learning methods and static datasets. This setting can lead to several problems, such as an outdated dataset, which may not correspond to reality, and an outdated model, which has its performance degrading over time. Concept drift is another aspect that emphasizes these issues, which corresponds to data distribution and pattern changes. In a text stream scenario, it is even more challenging due to its characteristics, such as the high speed and data arriving sequentially. In addition, models for this type of scenario must adhere to the constraints mentioned above while learning from the stream by storing texts for a limited time and consuming low memory. In this study, we performed a systematic literature review regarding concept drift adaptation in text stream scenarios. Considering well-defined criteria, we selected 40 papers to unravel aspects such as text drift categories, types of text drift detection, model update mechanism, the addressed stream mining tasks, types of text representations, and text representation update mechanism. In addition, we discussed drift visualization and simulation and listed real-world datasets used in the selected papers. Therefore, this paper comprehensively reviews the concept drift adaptation in text stream mining scenarios. ",

    "abstract": "Adversarial attacks have highlighted the vulnerability of classifiers based on machine learning for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) tasks. An adversarial attack perturbs SAR images of on-ground targets such that the classifiers are misled into making incorrect predictions. However, many existing attacking techniques rely on arbitrary manipulation of SAR images while overlooking the feasibility of executing the attacks on real-world SAR imagery. Instead, adversarial attacks should be able to be implemented by physical actions, for example, placing additional false objects as scatterers around the on-ground target to perturb the SAR image and fool the SAR ATR. In this paper, we propose the On-Target Scatterer Attack (OTSA), a scatterer-based physical adversarial attack. To ensure the feasibility of its physical execution, we enforce a constraint on the positioning of the scatterers. Specifically, we restrict the scatterers to be placed only on the target instead of in the shadow regions or the background. To achieve this, we introduce a positioning score based on Gaussian kernels and formulate an optimization problem for our OTSA attack. Using a gradient ascent method to solve the optimization problem, the OTSA can generate a vector of parameters describing the positions, shapes, sizes and amplitudes of the scatterers to guide the physical execution of the attack that will mislead SAR image classifiers. The experimental results show that our attack obtains significantly higher success rates under the positioning constraint compared with the existing method. ",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer inference approaches are usually based on gene sequences: parametric methods search for patterns that deviate from a particular genomic signature, while phylogenetic methods use sequences to reconstruct the gene and species trees. However, it is well-known that sequences have difficulty identifying ancient transfers since mutations have enough time to erase all evidence of such events. In this work, we ask whether character-based methods can predict gene transfers. Their advantage over sequences is that homologous genes can have low DNA similarity, but still have retained enough important common motifs that allow them to have common character traits, for instance the same functional or expression profile. A phylogeny that has two separate clades that acquired the same character independently might indicate the presence of a transfer even in the absence of sequence similarity. We introduce perfect transfer networks, which are phylogenetic networks that can explain the character diversity of a set of taxa under the assumption that characters have unique births, and that once a character is gained it is rarely lost. Examples of such traits include transposable elements, biochemical markers and emergence of organelles, just to name a few. We study the differences between our model and two similar models: perfect phylogenetic networks and ancestral recombination networks. Our goals are to initiate a study on the structural and algorithmic properties of perfect transfer networks. We then show that in polynomial time, one can decide whether a given network is a valid explanation for a set of taxa, and show how, for a given tree, one can add transfer edges to it so that it explains a set of taxa. We finally provide lower and upper bounds on the number of transfers required to explain a set of taxa, in the worst case. ",

In this work, we propose Diffusion-SS3D, a new perspective of enhancing the quality of pseudo-labels via the diffusion model for semi-supervised 3D object detection. Specifically, we include noises to produce corrupted 3D object size and class label distributions, and then utilize the diffusion model as a denoising process to obtain bounding box outputs. Moreover, we integrate the diffusion model into the teacher-student framework, so that the denoised bounding boxes can be used to improve pseudo-label generation, as well as the entire semi-supervised learning process. We conduct experiments on the ScanNet and SUN RGB-D benchmark datasets to demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance against existing methods.

Methods: A Cycle-GAN model was trained with MRI and CT scan slices from MR-LINAC treatments, generating sCT volumes. The analysis involved retrospective treatment plan data from patients with various tumors. sCT images were compared with standard CT scans using mean absolute error in Hounsfield Units (HU) and image similarity metrics (SSIM, PSNR, NCC). sCT volumes were integrated into a clinical treatment system for dosimetric re-evaluation. Results: The model, trained on 8405 frames from 57 patients and tested on 357 sCT frames from 17 patients, showed sCTs comparable to dCTs in electron density and structural similarity with MRI scans. The MAE between sCT and dCT was 49.2 +/- 13.2 HU, with sCT NCC exceeding dCT by 0.06, and SSIM and PSNR at 0.97 +/- 0.01 and 19.9 +/- 1.6 respectively. Dosimetric evaluations indicated minimal differences between sCTs and dCTs, with sCTs showing better air-bubble reconstruction. Conclusions: DL-based sCT generation on MR-Linacs is accurate for dose calculation and optimization in MRgART. This could facilitate MR-only treatment planning, enhancing simulation and adaptive planning efficiency on MR-Linacs. ",

    "abstract": "Analyzing the stability of graph neural networks (GNNs) under topological perturbations is key to understanding their transferability and the role of each architecture component. However, stability has been investigated only for particular architectures, questioning whether it holds for a broader spectrum of GNNs or only for a few instances. To answer this question, we study the stability of EdgeNet: a general GNN framework that unifies more than twenty solutions including the convolutional and attention-based classes, as well as graph isomorphism networks and hybrid architectures. We prove that all GNNs within the EdgeNet framework are stable to topological perturbations. By studying the effect of different EdgeNet categories on the stability, we show that GNNs with fewer degrees of freedom in their parameter space, linked to a lower representational capacity, are more stable. The key factor yielding this trade-off is the eigenvector misalignment between the EdgeNet parameter matrices and the graph shift operator. For example, graph convolutional neural networks that assign a single scalar per signal shift (hence, with a perfect alignment) are more stable than the more involved node or edge-varying counterparts. Extensive numerical results corroborate our theoretical findings and highlight the role of different architecture components in the trade-off. ",

Collective decision-making with a laser network, employing the chaotic and synchronous dynamics of optically interconnected lasers to address the competitive multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem, is a highly compelling approach due to its scalability and experimental feasibility. We investigated essential network structures for collective decision-making through quantitative stability analysis. Moreover, we demonstrated the asymmetric preferences of players in the CMAB problem, extending its functionality to more practical applications. Our study highlights the capability and significance of machine learning built upon chaotic lasers and photonic devices. ",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a method for finding a sparse representation of Barron functions. Specifically, given an $L^2$ function $f$, the inverse scale space flow is used to find a sparse measure $\\mu$ minimising the $L^2$ loss between the Barron function associated to the measure $\\mu$ and the function $f$. The convergence properties of this method are analysed in an ideal setting and in the cases of measurement noise and sampling bias. In an ideal setting the objective decreases strictly monotone in time to a minimizer with $\\mathcal{O}(1/t)$, and in the case of measurement noise or sampling bias the optimum is achieved up to a multiplicative or additive constant. This convergence is preserved on discretization of the parameter space, and the minimizers on increasingly fine discretizations converge to the optimum on the full parameter space. ",

In this paper, we focus on products of signed graphs. We recall the definitions of the Cartesian, tensor, strong, and corona products of signed graphs and prove results for them. In particular, we show that $(1)$ the Cartesian product of $\\Delta$-edge-colorable signed graphs is $\\Delta$-edge-colorable, $(2)$ the tensor product of a $\\Delta$-edge-colorable signed graph and a signed tree requires only $\\Delta$ colors and $(3)$ the corona product of almost any two signed graphs is $\\Delta$-edge-colorable. We also prove some results related to the coloring of products of signed paths and cycles. ",

    "abstract": "Most neural compression models are trained on large datasets of images or videos in order to generalize to unseen data. Such generalization typically requires large and expressive architectures with a high decoding complexity. Here we introduce C3, a neural compression method with strong rate-distortion (RD) performance that instead overfits a small model to each image or video separately. The resulting decoding complexity of C3 can be an order of magnitude lower than neural baselines with similar RD performance. C3 builds on COOL-CHIC (Ladune et al.) and makes several simple and effective improvements for images. We further develop new methodology to apply C3 to videos. On the CLIC2020 image benchmark, we match the RD performance of VTM, the reference implementation of the H.266 codec, with less than 3k MACs/pixel for decoding. On the UVG video benchmark, we match the RD performance of the Video Compression Transformer (Mentzer et al.), a well-established neural video codec, with less than 5k MACs/pixel for decoding. ",

    "title": "A Kernel-Based Neural Network Test for High-dimensional Sequencing Data  Analysis",
    "abstract": "The recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, especially the advance of deep neural network (DNN) technology, has revolutionized many fields. While DNN plays a central role in modern AI technology, it has been rarely used in sequencing data analysis due to challenges brought by high-dimensional sequencing data (e.g., overfitting). Moreover, due to the complexity of neural networks and their unknown limiting distributions, building association tests on neural networks for genetic association analysis remains a great challenge. To address these challenges and fill the important gap of using AI in high-dimensional sequencing data analysis, we introduce a new kernel-based neural network (KNN) test for complex association analysis of sequencing data. The test is built on our previously developed KNN framework, which uses random effects to model the overall effects of high-dimensional genetic data and adopts kernel-based neural network structures to model complex genotype-phenotype relationships. Based on KNN, a Wald-type test is then introduced to evaluate the joint association of high-dimensional genetic data with a disease phenotype of interest, considering non-linear and non-additive effects (e.g., interaction effects). Through simulations, we demonstrated that our proposed method attained higher power compared to the sequence kernel association test (SKAT), especially in the presence of non-linear and interaction effects. Finally, we apply the methods to the whole genome sequencing (WGS) dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, investigating new genes associated with the hippocampal volume change over time.
