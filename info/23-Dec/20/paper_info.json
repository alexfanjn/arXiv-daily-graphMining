    "abstract": "Inspection of insulators is important to ensure reliable operation of the power system. Deep learning has recently been explored to automate the inspection process by leveraging aerial images captured by drones along with powerful object detection models. However, a purely object detection-based approach exhibits class imbalance-induced poor detection accuracy for faulty insulators, especially for incipient faults. In order to address this issue in a data-efficient manner, this article proposes a two-stage approach that leverages object detection in conjunction with anomaly detection to reliably detect faults in insulators. The article adopts an explainable deep neural network-based one-class classifier for anomaly detection, that reduces the reliance on plentifully available images of faulty insulators, that might be difficult to obtain in real-life applications. The anomaly detection model is trained with two datasets -- representing data abundant and data scarce scenarios -- in unsupervised and semi-supervised manner. The results suggest that including as few as six real anomalies in the training dataset significantly improves the performance of the model, and enables reliable detection of rarely occurring faults in insulators. An analysis of the explanations provided by the anomaly detection model reveals that the model is able to accurately identify faulty regions on the insulator disks, while also exhibiting some false predictions.

The critical problem is to devise a proper family of graph generative models tailored to recommender systems. We propose an efficient generative model that jointly considers the preferences of users, the concurrence of items and some important graph structure information.

    "abstract": "The adversarial vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has been well-known and widely concerned, often under the context of learning top-$1$ attacks (e.g., fooling a DNN to classify a cat image as dog). This paper shows that the concern is much more serious by learning significantly more aggressive ordered top-$K$ clear-box~\\footnote{ This is often referred to as white/black-box attacks in the literature. We choose to adopt neutral terminology, clear/opaque-box attacks in this paper, and omit the prefix clear-box for simplicity.} targeted attacks proposed in Adversarial Distillation. We propose a novel and rigorous quadratic programming (QP) method of learning ordered top-$K$ attacks with low computing cost, dubbed as \\textbf{QuadAttac$K$}. Our QuadAttac$K$ directly solves the QP to satisfy the attack constraint in the feature embedding space (i.e., the input space to the final linear classifier), which thus exploits the semantics of the feature embedding space (i.e., the principle of class coherence). With the optimized feature embedding vector perturbation, it then computes the adversarial perturbation in the data space via the vanilla one-step back-propagation. In experiments, the proposed QuadAttac$K$ is tested in the ImageNet-1k classification using ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, and Vision Transformers (ViT-B and DEiT-S). It successfully pushes the boundary of successful ordered top-$K$ attacks from $K=10$ up to $K=20$ at a cheap budget ($1\\times 60$) and further improves attack success rates for $K=5$ for all tested models, while retaining the performance for $K=1$.

    "abstract": "This research report presents a proof-of-concept study on the application of machine learning techniques to video and speech data collected during diagnostic cognitive assessments of children with a neurodevelopmental disorder. The study utilised a dataset of 39 video recordings, capturing extensive sessions where clinicians administered, among other things, four cognitive assessment tests. From the first 40 minutes of each clinical session, covering the administration of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-V), we extracted head positions and speech turns of both clinician and child. Despite the limited sample size and heterogeneous recording styles, the analysis successfully extracted path signatures as features from the recorded data, focusing on patient-clinician interactions. Importantly, these features quantify the interpersonal dynamics of the assessment process (dialogue and movement patterns). Results suggest that these features exhibit promising potential for predicting all cognitive tests scores of the entire session length and for prototyping a predictive model as a clinical decision support tool. Overall, this proof of concept demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging machine learning techniques for clinical video and speech data analysis in order to potentially enhance the efficiency of cognitive assessments for neurodevelopmental disorders in children.

    "abstract": "Prompt injection has emerged as a serious security threat to large language models (LLMs). At present, the current best-practice for defending against newly-discovered prompt injection techniques is to add additional guardrails to the system (e.g., by updating the system prompt or using classifiers on the input and/or output of the model.) However, in the same way that variants of a piece of malware are created to evade anti-virus software, variants of a prompt injection can be created to evade the LLM's guardrails. Ideally, when a new prompt injection technique is discovered, candidate defenses should be tested not only against the successful prompt injection, but also against possible variants. In this work, we present, a tool to assist defenders in performing automated variant analysis of known prompt injection attacks. This involves solving two main challenges: (1) automatically generating variants of a given prompt according, and (2) automatically determining whether a variant was effective based only on the output of the model. This tool can also assist in generating datasets for jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, thus overcoming the scarcity of data in this domain. We evaluate Maatphor on three different types of prompt injection tasks. Starting from an ineffective (0%) seed prompt, Maatphor consistently generates variants that are at least 60% effective within the first 40 iterations. ",

However, most existing methods struggle with large graphs due to the complexity of representing the entire joint distribution across all node pairs and capturing both global and local graph structures simultaneously. To overcome these issues, we introduce a method that generates a graph by progressively expanding a single node to a target graph. In each step, nodes and edges are added in a localized manner through denoising diffusion, building first the global structure, and then refining the local details. The local generation avoids modeling the entire joint distribution over all node pairs, achieving substantial computational savings with subquadratic runtime relative to node count while maintaining high expressivity through multiscale generation. Our experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on well-established benchmark datasets while successfully scaling to graphs with at least 5000 nodes. Our method is also the first to successfully extrapolate to graphs outside of the training distribution, showcasing a much better generalization capability over existing methods. ",

In this paper, we introduce KGLens, a method to evaluate LLMs by generating natural language questions from a KG in a structure aware manner so that we can characterize its performance on a more aggregated level. KGLens uses a parameterized KG, where each edge is augmented with a beta distribution that guides how to sample edges from the KG for QA testing. As the evaluation proceeds, different edges of the parameterized KG are sampled and assessed appropriately, converging to a more global picture of the performance of the LLMs on the KG as a whole. In our experiments, we construct three domain-specific KGs for knowledge assessment, comprising over 19,000 edges, 700 relations, and 21,000 entities. The results demonstrate that KGLens can not only assess overall performance but also provide topic, temporal, and relation analyses of LLMs. This showcases the adaptability and customizability of KGLens, emphasizing its ability to focus the evaluation based on specific criteria.

Since communication in real-world scenarios is vulnerable to noises and adversarial attacks, it is crucial to develop robust communicative MARL technique. However, existing research in this domain has predominantly focused on passive defense strategies, where agents receive all messages equally, making it hard to balance performance and robustness. We propose an active defense strategy, where agents automatically reduce the impact of potentially harmful messages on the final decision. There are two challenges to implement this strategy, that are defining unreliable messages and adjusting the unreliable messages' impact on the final decision properly. To address them, we design an Active Defense Multi-Agent Communication framework (ADMAC), which estimates the reliability of received messages and adjusts their impact on the final decision accordingly with the help of a decomposable decision structure. The superiority of ADMAC over existing methods is validated by experiments in three communication-critical tasks under four types of attacks. ",

    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization (CO) on graphs is a classic topic that has been extensively studied across many scientific and industrial fields. Recently, solving CO problems on graphs through learning methods has attracted great attention. Advanced deep learning methods, e.g., graph neural networks (GNNs), have been used to effectively assist the process of solving COs. However, current frameworks based on GNNs are mainly designed for certain CO problems, thereby failing to consider their transferable and generalizable abilities among different COs on graphs. Moreover, simply using original graphs to model COs only captures the direct correlations among objects, which does not consider the mathematical logicality and properties of COs. In this paper, we propose a unified pre-training and adaptation framework for COs on graphs with the help of the maximum satisfiability (Max-SAT) problem. We first use Max-SAT to bridge different COs on graphs since they can be converted to Max-SAT problems represented by standard formulas and clauses with logical information. Then, we further design a pre-training and domain adaptation framework to extract the transferable and generalizable features so that different COs can benefit from them. In the pre-training stage, Max-SAT instances are generated to initialize the parameters of the model. In the fine-tuning stage, instances from CO and Max-SAT problems are used for adaptation so that the transferable ability can be further improved. Numerical experiments on several datasets show that features extracted by our framework exhibit superior transferability and Max-SAT can boost the ability to solve COs on graphs. ",

    "abstract": "Anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS) has been widely studied in one-class classification (OCC) setting. The training samples in OCC are assumed to be normal, which is difficult to guarantee in practical situations. Such a case may degrade the performance of OCC-based anomaly detection methods which fit the training distribution as the normal distribution. In this paper, we propose MTGFlow, an unsupervised anomaly detection approach for MTS anomaly detection via dynamic Graph and entity-aware normalizing Flow. MTGFlow first estimates the density of the entire training samples and then identifies anomalous instances based on the density of the test samples within the fitted distribution. This relies on a widely accepted assumption that anomalous instances exhibit more sparse densities than normal ones, with no reliance on the clean training dataset. However, it is intractable to directly estimate the density due to complex dependencies among entities and their diverse inherent characteristics. To mitigate this, we utilize the graph structure learning model to learn interdependent and evolving relations among entities, which effectively captures complex and accurate distribution patterns of MTS. In addition, our approach incorporates the unique characteristics of individual entities by employing an entity-aware normalizing flow. This enables us to represent each entity as a parameterized normal distribution. Furthermore, considering that some entities present similar characteristics, we propose a cluster strategy that capitalizes on the commonalities of entities with similar characteristics, resulting in more precise and detailed density estimation. We refer to this cluster-aware extension as MTGFlow_cluster. Extensive experiments are conducted on six widely used benchmark datasets, in which MTGFlow and MTGFlow cluster demonstrate their superior detection performance. ",

    "abstract": "Soft filter pruning~(SFP) has emerged as an effective pruning technique for allowing pruned filters to update and the opportunity for them to regrow to the network. However, this pruning strategy applies training and pruning in an alternative manner, which inevitably causes inconsistent representations between the reconstructed network~(R-NN) at the training and the pruned network~(P-NN) at the inference, resulting in performance degradation. In this paper, we propose to mitigate this gap by learning consistent representation for soft filter pruning, dubbed as CR-SFP. Specifically, for each training step, CR-SFP optimizes the R-NN and P-NN simultaneously with different distorted versions of the same training data, while forcing them to be consistent by minimizing their posterior distribution via the bidirectional KL-divergence loss. Meanwhile, the R-NN and P-NN share backbone parameters thus only additional classifier parameters are introduced. After training, we can export the P-NN for inference. CR-SFP is a simple yet effective training framework to improve the accuracy of P-NN without introducing any additional inference cost. It can also be combined with a variety of pruning criteria and loss functions. Extensive experiments demonstrate our CR-SFP achieves consistent improvements across various CNN architectures. Notably, on ImageNet, our CR-SFP reduces more than 41.8\\% FLOPs on ResNet18 with 69.2\\% top-1 accuracy, improving SFP by 2.1\\% under the same training settings.

SVGs are particularly popular in the fields of web development and graphic design. Existing approaches for SVG modeling using deep learning often struggle with generating complex SVGs and are restricted to simpler ones that require extensive processing and simplification. This paper introduces StarVector, a multimodal SVG generation model that effectively integrates Code Generation Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) and vision models. Our approach utilizes a CLIP image encoder to extract visual representations from pixel-based images, which are then transformed into visual tokens via an adapter module. These visual tokens are pre-pended to the SVG token embeddings, and the sequence is modeled by the StarCoder model using next-token prediction, effectively learning to align the visual and code tokens. This enables StarVector to generate unrestricted SVGs that accurately represent pixel images. To evaluate StarVector's performance, we present SVG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating SVG methods across multiple datasets and relevant metrics. Within this benchmark, we introduce novel datasets including SVG-Stack, a large-scale dataset of real-world SVG examples, and use it to pre-train StarVector as a large foundation model for SVGs. Our results demonstrate significant enhancements in visual quality and complexity handling over current methods, marking a notable advancement in SVG generation technology.

However, research on the threat to model privacy in recommender systems, such as model stealing attacks, is still in its infancy. Some adversarial attacks have achieved model stealing attacks against recommender systems, to some extent, by collecting abundant training data of the target model (target data) or making a mass of queries. In this paper, we constrain the volume of available target data and queries and utilize auxiliary data, which shares the item set with the target data, to promote model stealing attacks. Although the target model treats target and auxiliary data differently, their similar behavior patterns allow them to be fused using an attention mechanism to assist attacks. Besides, we design stealing functions to effectively extract the recommendation list obtained by querying the target model. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are applicable to most recommender systems and various scenarios and exhibit excellent attack performance on multiple datasets. ",

Leveraging the network information, we aim to utilize hidden confounders that may not be directly accessible in the observed data, thereby enhancing the practical applicability of the strong ignorability assumption. To achieve this, we first employ Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to learn a shared representation of the confounders. Then, our approach utilizes separate neural networks to infer potential outcomes for each treatment. We design a loss function as a weighted combination of two components: representation loss and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss on the factual outcomes. To measure the representation loss, we extend existing metrics such as Wasserstein and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) from the binary treatment setting to the multiple treatments scenario. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology, we conduct a series of experiments on the benchmark datasets such as BlogCatalog and Flickr. The experimental results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of our models when compared to baseline methods. ",

    "abstract": "Fingerprint authentication is a popular security mechanism for smartphones and laptops. However, its adoption in web and cloud environments has been limited due to privacy concerns over storing and processing biometric data on servers. This paper introduces Blind-Touch, a novel machine learning-based fingerprint authentication system leveraging homomorphic encryption to address these privacy concerns. Homomorphic encryption allows computations on encrypted data without decrypting. Thus, Blind-Touch can keep fingerprint data encrypted on the server while performing machine learning operations. Blind-Touch combines three strategies to efficiently utilize homomorphic encryption in machine learning: (1) It optimizes the feature vector for a distributed architecture, processing the first fully connected layer (FC-16) in plaintext on the client side and the subsequent layer (FC-1) post-encryption on the server, thereby minimizing encrypted computations; (2) It employs a homomorphic encryptioncompatible data compression technique capable of handling 8,192 authentication results concurrently; and (3) It utilizes a clustered server architecture to simultaneously process authentication results, thereby enhancing scalability with increasing user numbers. Blind-Touch achieves high accuracy on two benchmark fingerprint datasets, with a 93.6% F1- score for the PolyU dataset and a 98.2% F1-score for the SOKOTO dataset. Moreover, Blind-Touch can match a fingerprint among 5,000 in about 0.65 seconds. With its privacyfocused design, high accuracy, and efficiency, Blind-Touch is a promising alternative to conventional fingerprint authentication for web and cloud applications. ",

However, most existing methods use large multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to train their models from scratch, resulting in hours of training for a single scene. Recently, how to accelerate the neural surfaces learning has received a lot of attention and remains an open problem. In this work, we propose a prior-based residual learning paradigm for fast multi-view neural surface reconstruction. This paradigm consists of two optimization stages. In the first stage, we propose to leverage generalization models to generate a basis signed distance function (SDF) field. This initial field can be quickly obtained by fusing multiple local SDF fields produced by generalization models. This provides a coarse global geometry prior. Based on this prior, in the second stage, a fast residual learning strategy based on hash-encoding networks is proposed to encode an offset SDF field for the basis SDF field. Moreover, we introduce a prior-guided sampling scheme to help the residual learning stage converge better, and thus recover finer structures. With our designed paradigm, experimental results show that our method only takes about 3 minutes to reconstruct the surface of a single scene, while achieving competitive surface quality. Our code will be released upon publication. ",

While large strides have been made towards more effective contact tracing algorithms, we argue that privacy concerns currently hold deployment back. The essence of a contact tracing algorithm constitutes the communication of a risk score. Yet, it is precisely the communication and release of this score to a user that an adversary can leverage to gauge the private health status of an individual. We pinpoint a realistic attack scenario and propose a contact tracing algorithm with differential privacy guarantees against this attack. The algorithm is tested on the two most widely used agent-based COVID19 simulators and demonstrates superior performance in a wide range of settings. Especially for realistic test scenarios and while releasing each risk score with epsilon=1 differential privacy, we achieve a two to ten-fold reduction in the infection rate of the virus. To the best of our knowledge, this presents the first contact tracing algorithm with differential privacy guarantees when revealing risk scores for COVID19. ",

Humans are highly articulated creating pose-dependent appearance effects like self-shadows and wrinkles, and skin as well as clothing require complex and space-varying BRDF models. While recent human relighting approaches can recover plausible material-light decompositions from multi-view video, they do not generalize to novel poses and still suffer from visual artifacts. To address this, we propose Relightable Neural Actor, the first video-based method for learning a photorealistic neural human model that can be relighted, allows appearance editing, and can be controlled by arbitrary skeletal poses. Importantly, for learning our human avatar, we solely require a multi-view recording of the human under a known, but static lighting condition. To achieve this, we represent the geometry of the actor with a drivable density field that models pose-dependent clothing deformations and provides a mapping between 3D and UV space, where normal, visibility, and materials are encoded. To evaluate our approach in real-world scenarios, we collect a new dataset with four actors recorded under different light conditions, indoors and outdoors, providing the first benchmark of its kind for human relighting, and demonstrating state-of-the-art relighting results for novel human poses.

In this paper, a shallow artificial neural network (ANN) is specifically trained to solve Sudoku puzzles with minimal training data. The model has a unique loss function that integrates losses calculated using the ASP solver outputs, effectively enhancing its training efficiency. Most notably, the model shows a significant improvement in solving Sudoku puzzles using only 12 puzzles for training and testing without hyperparameter tuning. This advancement indicates that the model's enhanced reasoning capabilities have practical applications, extending well beyond Sudoku puzzles to potentially include a variety of other domains.

Large language models for code are commonly trained on large unsanitised corpora of source code scraped from the internet. The content of these datasets is memorised and can be extracted by attackers with data extraction attacks. In this work, we explore memorisation in large language models for code and compare the rate of memorisation with large language models trained on natural language. We adopt an existing benchmark for natural language and construct a benchmark for code by identifying samples that are vulnerable to attack. We run both benchmarks against a variety of models, and perform a data extraction attack. We find that large language models for code are vulnerable to data extraction attacks, like their natural language counterparts. From the training data that was identified to be potentially extractable we were able to extract 47% from a CodeGen-Mono-16B code completion model. We also observe that models memorise more, as their parameter count grows, and that their pre-training data are also vulnerable to attack. We also find that data carriers are memorised at a higher rate than regular code or documentation and that different model architectures memorise different samples. Data leakage has severe outcomes, so we urge the research community to further investigate the extent of this phenomenon using a wider range of models and extraction techniques in order to build safeguards to mitigate this issue.

Since all DP mechanisms involve adding noise to results of statistical queries, they are expected to impact our ability to accurately analyze and learn from data, in effect trading off privacy with utility. Alarmingly, the impact of DP on utility can vary significantly among different sub-populations. A simple way to reduce this disparity is with stratification. First compute an independent private estimate for each group in the data set (which may be the intersection of several protected classes), then, to compute estimates of global statistics, appropriately recombine these group estimates. Our main observation is that naive stratification often yields high-accuracy estimates of population-level statistics, without the need for additional privacy budget. We support this observation theoretically and empirically. Our theoretical results center on the private mean estimation problem, while our empirical results center on extensive experiments on private data synthesis to demonstrate the effectiveness of stratification on a variety of private mechanisms. Overall, we argue that this straightforward approach provides a strong baseline against which future work on reducing utility disparities of DP mechanisms should be compared. ",

First, we develop methods to build a spatial ontology defining concepts and relations relevant for indoor and outdoor robot operation. In particular, we use a Large Language Model (LLM) to build such an ontology, thus largely reducing the amount of manual effort required. Second, we leverage the spatial ontology for 3D scene graph construction using Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) to add logical rules, or axioms (e.g., \"a beach contains sand\"), which provide additional supervisory signals at training time thus reducing the need for labelled data, providing better predictions, and even allowing predicting concepts unseen at training time. We test our approach in a variety of datasets, including indoor, rural, and coastal environments, and show that it leads to a significant increase in the quality of the 3D scene graph generation with sparsely annotated data.

However, the size of transformer models is increasing continuously, driven by enhanced capabilities across various deep-learning tasks. This trend of ever-increasing model size has given rise to new challenges in terms of memory and computing requirements. Conventional computing platforms, including GPUs, suffer from suboptimal performance due to the memory demands imposed by models with millions/billions of parameters. The emerging chiplet-based platforms provide a new avenue for compute- and data-intensive machine learning (ML) applications enabled by a Network-on-Interposer (NoI).

We demonstrate that the proposed NoI architecture caters to the data access patterns inherent in a transformer model. The optimized placement of the chiplets and the associated NoI links and routers enable superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art hardware accelerators.

    "title": "CAManim: Animating end-to-end network activation maps",
    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in numerous domains due to their high performance and accessibility to developers and application-specific end-users. Fundamental to image-based applications is the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which possess the ability to automatically extract features from data. However, comprehending these complex models and their learned representations, which typically comprise millions of parameters and numerous layers, remains a challenge for both developers and end-users. This challenge arises due to the absence of interpretable and transparent tools to make sense of black-box models. There exists a growing body of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) literature, including a collection of methods denoted Class Activation Maps (CAMs), that seek to demystify what representations the model learns from the data, how it informs a given prediction, and why it, at times, performs poorly in certain tasks. We propose a novel XAI visualization method denoted CAManim that seeks to simultaneously broaden and focus end-user understanding of CNN predictions by animating the CAM-based network activation maps through all layers, effectively depicting from end-to-end how a model progressively arrives at the final layer activation. Herein, we demonstrate that CAManim works with any CAM-based method and various CNN architectures. Beyond qualitative model assessments, we additionally propose a novel quantitative assessment that expands upon the Remove and Debias (ROAD) metric, pairing the qualitative end-to-end network visual explanations assessment with our novel quantitative \"yellow brick ROAD\" assessment (ybROAD). This builds upon prior research to address the increasing demand for interpretable, robust, and transparent model assessment methodology, ultimately improving an end-user's trust in a given model's predictions.

This allows it to generalize to adversarial datasets and domains that supervised models require specific training data for. Our empirical results show that our approach outperforms previous zero-shot approaches on FEVER, FEVER-Symmetric, FEVER 2.0, and Climate-FEVER, while being comparable or better than supervised models on the adversarial and the out-of-domain datasets.

Considering the robots' heterogeneous capabilities and environmental factors, we generalize the conventional Blotto game by incorporating heterogeneous robot types and graph constraints that capture the robot transitions between sites. Then we employ the Double Oracle Algorithm (DOA) to solve for the Nash equilibrium of the generalized Blotto game. Particularly, for cyclic-dominance-heterogeneous (CDH) robots that inhibit each other, we define a new transformation rule between any two robot types. Building on the transformation, we design a novel utility function to measure the game's outcome quantitatively. Moreover, we rigorously prove the correctness of the designed utility function.

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring dialogues with more complex goals, such as negotiation, persuasion, and emotional support, which go beyond traditional service-focused dialogue systems. Apart from the requirement for much more sophisticated strategic reasoning and communication skills, a significant challenge of these tasks lies in the difficulty of objectively measuring the achievement of their goals in a quantifiable way, making it difficult for existing research to directly optimize the dialogue procedure towards them. In our work, we emphasize the multifaceted nature of complex dialogue goals and argue that it is more feasible to accomplish them by comprehensively considering and jointly promoting their different aspects. To this end, we propose a novel dialogue framework, Cooper, which coordinates multiple specialized agents, each dedicated to a specific dialogue goal aspect separately, to approach the complex objective. Through this divide-and-conquer manner, we make complex dialogue goals more approachable and elicit greater intelligence via the collaboration of individual agents. Experiments on persuasion and emotional support dialogues demonstrate the superiority of our method over a set of competitive baselines. ",

Keypoint-based algorithms, particularly those based on SIFT, have achieved good results in CMFD. However, the most of keypoint detection algorithms often fail to generate sufficient matches when tampered patches are present in smooth areas. To tackle this problem, we introduce entropy images to determine the coordinates and scales of keypoints, resulting significantly increasing the number of keypoints. Furthermore, we develop an entropy level clustering algorithm to avoid increased matching complexity caused by non-ideal distribution of grayscale values in keypoints. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a good balance between performance and time efficiency. ",

    "abstract": "Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) allow user processes to create enclaves that protect security-sensitive computation against access from the OS kernel and the hypervisor. Recent work has shown that TEEs are vulnerable to side-channel attacks that allow an adversary to learn secrets shielded in enclaves. The majority of such attacks trigger exceptions or interrupts to trace the control or data flow of enclave execution. We propose QuanShield, a system that protects enclaves from side-channel attacks that interrupt enclave execution. The main idea behind QuanShield is to strengthen resource isolation by creating an interrupt-free environment on a dedicated CPU core for running enclaves in which enclaves terminate when interrupts occur. QuanShield avoids interrupts by exploiting the tickless scheduling mode supported by recent OS kernels. QuanShield then uses the save area (SA) of the enclave, which is used by the hardware to support interrupt handling, as a second stack. Through an LLVM-based compiler pass, QuanShield modifies enclave instructions to store/load memory references, such as function frame base addresses, to/from the SA. When an interrupt occurs, the hardware overwrites the data in the SA with CPU state, thus ensuring that enclave execution fails. Our evaluation shows that QuanShield significantly raises the bar for interrupt-based attacks with practical overhead. ",

However, it predominantly adopts a self-attention-based MossFormer module, which tends to emphasize longer-range, coarser-scale dependencies, with a deficiency in effectively modelling finer-scale recurrent patterns. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid model that provides the capabilities to model both long-range, coarse-scale dependencies and fine-scale recurrent patterns by integrating a recurrent module into the MossFormer framework. Instead of applying the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that use traditional recurrent connections, we present a recurrent module based on a feedforward sequential memory network (FSMN), which is considered \"RNN-free\" recurrent network due to the ability to capture recurrent patterns without using recurrent connections. Our recurrent module mainly comprises an enhanced dilated FSMN block by using gated convolutional units (GCU) and dense connections. In addition, a bottleneck layer and an output layer are also added for controlling information flow. The recurrent module relies on linear projections and convolutions for seamless, parallel processing of the entire sequence. The integrated MossFormer2 hybrid model demonstrates remarkable enhancements over MossFormer and surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in WSJ0-2/3mix, Libri2Mix, and WHAM!/WHAMR! benchmarks. ",

Nevertheless, achieving real-time NeRF rendering in large-scale scenes has presented challenges, often leading to the adoption of either intricate baked mesh representations with a substantial number of triangles or resource-intensive ray marching in baked representations. We challenge these conventions, observing that high-quality geometry, represented by meshes with substantial triangles, is not necessary for achieving photorealistic rendering quality. Consequently, we propose MixRT, a novel NeRF representation that includes a low-quality mesh, a view-dependent displacement map, and a compressed NeRF model. This design effectively harnesses the capabilities of existing graphics hardware, thus enabling real-time NeRF rendering on edge devices. Leveraging a highly-optimized WebGL-based rendering framework, our proposed MixRT attains real-time rendering speeds on edge devices (over 30 FPS at a resolution of 1280 x 720 on a MacBook M1 Pro laptop), better rendering quality (0.2 PSNR higher in indoor scenes of the Unbounded-360 datasets), and a smaller storage size (less than 80% compared to state-of-the-art methods).

Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel framework predicated on dynamic and socially-aware decision-making game theory to augment the social decision-making prowess of AVs in mixed driving environments.This comprehensive framework is delineated into three primary modules: Social Tendency Recognition, Mixed-Strategy Game Modeling, and Expert Mode Learning. We introduce 'Interaction Orientation' as a metric to evaluate the social decision-making tendencies of various agents, incorporating both environmental factors and trajectory data. The mixed-strategy game model developed as part of this framework considers the evolution of future traffic scenarios and includes a utility function that balances safety, operational efficiency, and the unpredictability of environmental conditions. To adapt to real-world driving complexities, our framework utilizes dynamic optimization techniques for assimilating and learning from expert human driving strategies. These strategies are compiled into a comprehensive library, serving as a reference for future decision-making processes. Our approach is validated through extensive driving datasets, and the results demonstrate marked enhancements in decision timing, precision. ",

Recently, the GNN calibration problem has attracted increasing attention, especially in cost-sensitive scenarios. Previous work has gained empirical insights on the issue, and devised effective approaches for it, but theoretical supports still fall short. In this work, we shed light on the relationship between GNN calibration and nodewise similarity via theoretical analysis. A novel calibration framework, named SimCalib, is accordingly proposed to consider similarity between nodes at global and local levels. At the global level, the Mahalanobis distance between the current node and class prototypes is integrated to implicitly consider similarity between the current node and all nodes in the same class. At the local level, the similarity of node representation movement dynamics, quantified by nodewise homophily and relative degree, is considered. Informed about the application of nodewise movement patterns in analyzing nodewise behavior on the over-smoothing problem, we empirically present a possible relationship between over-smoothing and GNN calibration problem. Experimentally, we discover a correlation between nodewise similarity and model calibration improvement, in alignment with our theoretical results. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments investigating different design factors and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SimCalib framework for GNN calibration by achieving state-of-the-art performance on 14 out of 16 benchmarks.

Existing works on offline RL theory primarily emphasize a few trivial settings, such as linear MDP or general function approximation with strong assumptions and independent data, which lack guidance for practical use. The coupling of deep learning and Bellman residuals makes this problem challenging, in addition to the difficulty of data dependence. In this paper, we establish a non-asymptotic estimation error of pessimistic offline RL using general neural network approximation with $\\mathcal{C}$-mixing data regarding the structure of networks, the dimension of datasets, and the concentrability of data coverage, under mild assumptions. Our result shows that the estimation error consists of two parts: the first converges to zero at a desired rate on the sample size with partially controllable concentrability, and the second becomes negligible if the residual constraint is tight. This result demonstrates the explicit efficiency of deep adversarial offline RL frameworks. We utilize the empirical process tool for $\\mathcal{C}$-mixing sequences and the neural network approximation theory for the H\\\"{o}lder class to achieve this. We also develop methods to bound the Bellman estimation error caused by function approximation with empirical Bellman constraint perturbations. Additionally, we present a result that lessens the curse of dimensionality using data with low intrinsic dimensionality and function classes with low complexity.

    "abstract": "One of the ultimate goals of representation learning is to achieve compactness within a class and well-separability between classes. Many outstanding metric-based and prototype-based methods following the Expectation-Maximization paradigm, have been proposed for this objective. However, they inevitably introduce biases into the learning process, particularly with long-tail distributed training data. In this paper, we reveal that the class prototype is not necessarily to be derived from training features and propose a novel perspective to use pre-defined class anchors serving as feature centroid to unidirectionally guide feature learning. However, the pre-defined anchors may have a large semantic distance from the pixel features, which prevents them from being directly applied. To address this issue and generate feature centroid independent from feature learning, a simple yet effective Semantic Anchor Regularization (SAR) is proposed. SAR ensures the interclass separability of semantic anchors in the semantic space by employing a classifier-aware auxiliary cross-entropy loss during training via disentanglement learning. By pulling the learned features to these semantic anchors, several advantages can be attained: 1) the intra-class compactness and naturally inter-class separability, 2) induced bias or errors from feature learning can be avoided, and 3) robustness to the long-tailed problem. The proposed SAR can be used in a plug-and-play manner in the existing models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the SAR performs better than previous sophisticated prototype-based methods.

First, an angle-displacement rigidity theory is developed, which can be used to localize all the free nodes by the known positions of the anchor nodes and local relative measurements (local relative position, distance, local relative bearing, angle, or ratio-of-distance measurements). Then, necessary and sufficient conditions for network localizability are given. Finally, a distributed network localization protocol is proposed, which can globally estimate the locations of all the free nodes of a network if the network is infinitesimally angle-displacement rigid.

    "title": "Predicting Line-Level Defects by Capturing Code Contexts with  Hierarchical Transformers",
    "abstract": "Software defects consume 40% of the total budget in software development and cost the global economy billions of dollars every year. Unfortunately, despite the use of many software quality assurance (SQA) practices in software development (e.g., code review, continuous integration), defects may still exist in the official release of a software product. Therefore, prioritizing SQA efforts for the vulnerable areas of the codebase is essential to ensure the high quality of a software release. Predicting software defects at the line level could help prioritize the SQA effort but is a highly challenging task given that only ~3% of lines of a codebase could be defective. Existing works on line-level defect prediction often fall short and cannot fully leverage the line-level defect information. In this paper, we propose Bugsplorer, a novel deep-learning technique for line-level defect prediction. It leverages a hierarchical structure of transformer models to represent two types of code elements: code tokens and code lines. Unlike the existing techniques that are optimized for file-level defect prediction, Bugsplorer is optimized for a line-level defect prediction objective. Our evaluation with five performance metrics shows that Bugsplorer has a promising capability of predicting defective lines with 26-72% better accuracy than that of the state-of-the-art technique. It can rank the first 20% defective lines within the top 1-3% suspicious lines. Thus, Bugsplorer has the potential to significantly reduce SQA costs by ranking defective lines higher. ",

Despite the acknowledged significance of difficulty, previous KT research has yet to exploit its potential for model optimization and has struggled to predict difficulty from unseen data. To address these problems, we propose a difficulty-centered contrastive learning method for KT models and a Large Language Model (LLM)-based framework for difficulty prediction. These innovative methods seek to improve the performance of KT models and provide accurate difficulty estimates for unseen data. Our ablation study demonstrates the efficacy of these techniques by demonstrating enhanced KT model performance.

However, GNN-based methods can miss useful message correlations. Moreover, they require manual labeling for training and predetermining the number of events for prediction. In this work, we address social event detection via graph structural entropy (SE) minimization. While keeping the merits of the GNN-based methods, the proposed framework, HISEvent, constructs more informative message graphs, is unsupervised, and does not require the number of events given a priori. Specifically, we incrementally explore the graph neighborhoods using 1-dimensional (1D) SE minimization to supplement the existing message graph with edges between semantically related messages. We then detect events from the message graph by hierarchically minimizing 2-dimensional (2D) SE. Our proposed 1D and 2D SE minimization algorithms are customized for social event detection and effectively tackle the efficiency problem of the existing SE minimization algorithms. Extensive experiments show that HISEvent consistently outperforms GNN-based methods and achieves the new SOTA for social event detection under both closed- and open-set settings while being efficient and robust.

Existing retrieval-based approaches solve this task by concentrating on the specific relation at different hops and predicting the intermediate entity within the reasoning path. During the reasoning process of these methods, the representation of relations are fixed but the initial relation representation may not be optimal. We claim they fail to utilize information from head-tail entities and the semantic connection between relations to enhance the current relation representation, which undermines the ability to capture information of relations in KGs. To address this issue, we construct a \\textbf{dual relation graph} where each node denotes a relation in the original KG (\\textbf{primal entity graph}) and edges are constructed between relations sharing same head or tail entities. Then we iteratively do primal entity graph reasoning, dual relation graph information propagation, and interaction between these two graphs. In this way, the interaction between entity and relation is enhanced, and we derive better entity and relation representations.

    "abstract": "Nowadays, scene text recognition has attracted more and more attention due to its diverse applications. Most state-of-the-art methods adopt an encoder-decoder framework with the attention mechanism, autoregressively generating text from left to right. Despite the convincing performance, this sequential decoding strategy constrains inference speed. Conversely, non-autoregressive models provide faster, simultaneous predictions but often sacrifice accuracy. Although utilizing an explicit language model can improve performance, it burdens the computational load. Besides, separating linguistic knowledge from vision information may harm the final prediction. In this paper, we propose an alternative solution, using a parallel and iterative decoder that adopts an easy-first decoding strategy. Furthermore, we regard text recognition as an image-based conditional text generation task and utilize the discrete diffusion strategy, ensuring exhaustive exploration of bidirectional contextual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior results on the benchmark datasets, including both Chinese and English text images. ",

Despite considerable advancements, existing MOT methodologies tend to falter when faced with non-uniform movements, occlusions, and appearance-reappearance scenarios of the objects. Recognizing this inadequacy, we put forward an integrated MOT method that not only marries object detection and identity linkage within a singular, end-to-end trainable framework but also equips the model with the ability to maintain object identity links over long periods of time. Our proposed model, named STMMOT, is built around four key modules: 1) candidate proposal generation, which generates object proposals via a vision-transformer encoder-decoder architecture that detects the object from each frame in the video; 2) scale variant pyramid, a progressive pyramid structure to learn the self-scale and cross-scale similarities in multi-scale feature maps; 3) spatio-temporal memory encoder, extracting the essential information from the memory associated with each object under tracking; and 4) spatio-temporal memory decoder, simultaneously resolving the tasks of object detection and identity association for MOT. Our system leverages a robust spatio-temporal memory module that retains extensive historical observations and effectively encodes them using an attention-based aggregator. The uniqueness of STMMOT lies in representing objects as dynamic query embeddings that are updated continuously, which enables the prediction of object states with attention mechanisms and eradicates the need for post-processing.

Much existing work is devoted to learning dynamic graph structures among sensors, and the strategy of mining spatial dependencies from traffic data, known as data-driven, tends to be an intuitive and effective approach. However, Time-Shift of traffic patterns and noise induced by random factors hinder data-driven spatial dependence modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic frequency domain graph convolution network (DFDGCN) to capture spatial dependencies. Specifically, we mitigate the effects of time-shift by Fourier transform, and introduce the identity embedding of sensors and time embedding when capturing data for graph learning since traffic data with noise is not entirely reliable. The graph is combined with static predefined and self-adaptive graphs during graph convolution to predict future traffic data through classical causal convolutions.

By leveraging the higher-order cumulants of non-Gaussian data, we provide an analytical solution for estimating the causal coefficients or their ratios. With the estimated (ratios of) causal coefficients, we propose a novel approach to identify the existence of a causal edge between two observed variables subject to latent variable influence. In case when such a causal edge exits, we introduce an asymmetry criterion to determine the causal direction. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. ",

In this paper, we propose a novel emotional CSS model, termed ECSS, that includes two main components: 1) to enhance emotion understanding, we introduce a heterogeneous graph-based emotional context modeling mechanism, which takes the multi-source dialogue history as input to model the dialogue context and learn the emotion cues from the context; 2) to achieve emotion rendering, we employ a contrastive learning-based emotion renderer module to infer the accurate emotion style for the target utterance. To address the issue of data scarcity, we meticulously create emotional labels in terms of category and intensity, and annotate additional emotional information on the existing conversational dataset (DailyTalk).

Recently, offline data mixing augmentation, e.g. handcrafted and saliency information-based mixup, has been gradually replaced by automatic mixing approaches. Through minimizing two sub-tasks, namely, mixed sample generation and mixup classification in an end-to-end way, AutoMix significantly improves accuracy on image classification tasks. However, as the optimization objective is consistent for the two sub-tasks, this approach is prone to generating consistent instead of diverse mixed samples, which results in overfitting for target task training. In this paper, we propose AdAutomixup, an adversarial automatic mixup augmentation approach that generates challenging samples to train a robust classifier for image classification, by alternatively optimizing the classifier and the mixup sample generator. AdAutomixup comprises two modules, a mixed example generator, and a target classifier. The mixed sample generator aims to produce hard mixed examples to challenge the target classifier while the target classifier`s aim is to learn robust features from hard mixed examples to improve generalization. To prevent the collapse of the inherent meanings of images, we further introduce an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher and cosine similarity to train AdAutomixup in an end-to-end way.

We determine the number of frequency bands really needed at each time period. The frequency bands that are not needed can be disabled to reduce energy consumption.

While the parameter solution size leads to an FPT result for unsigned graphs, we obtain W[2]-completeness for the signed setting.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework with context disentangling and prototype inheriting for robust visual grounding to handle both scenes. Specifically, the context disentangling disentangles the referent and context features, which achieves better discrimination between them. The prototype inheriting inherits the prototypes discovered from the disentangled visual features by a prototype bank to fully utilize the seen data, especially for the open-vocabulary scene. The fused features, obtained by leveraging Hadamard product on disentangled linguistic and visual features of prototypes to avoid sharp adjusting the importance between the two types of features, are then attached with a special token and feed to a vision Transformer encoder for bounding box regression.

In this article, we propose the concept of generative mobile edge networks and overview widely adopted GAI technologies and their applications in mobile edge networks. We then discuss the potential challenges faced by generative mobile edge networks in resource-constrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we develop a universal resource-efficient generative incentive mechanism framework, in which we design resource-efficient methods for network overhead reduction, formulate appropriate incentive mechanisms for the resource allocation problem, and utilize Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) to find the optimal incentive mechanism solutions. Furthermore, we conduct a case study on resource-constrained mobile edge networks, employing model partition for efficient AI task offloading and proposing a GDM-based Stackelberg model to motivate edge devices to contribute computing resources for mobile edge intelligence. Finally, we propose several open directions that could contribute to the future popularity of generative mobile edge networks. ",

Besides discrimination power, interpretability is another important yet under-explored property for CNNs. One difficulty in the CNN interpretability is that filters and image classes are entangled. In this paper, we introduce a novel pathway to alleviate the entanglement between filters and image classes. The proposed pathway groups the filters in a late conv-layer of CNN into class-specific clusters. Clusters and classes are in a one-to-one relationship. Specifically, we use the Bernoulli sampling to generate the filter-cluster assignment matrix from a learnable filter-class correspondence matrix. To enable end-to-end optimization, we develop a novel reparameterization trick for handling the non-differentiable Bernoulli sampling. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on ten widely used network architectures (including nine CNNs and a ViT) and five benchmark datasets. Experimental results have demonstrated that our method PICNN (the combination of standard CNNs with our proposed pathway) exhibits greater interpretability than standard CNNs while achieving higher or comparable discrimination power.

Existing methods have synthesised body motion only from observed past motion, despite the fact that human gaze is known to correlate strongly with body movements and is readily available in recent VR headsets. We present GazeMoDiff -- a novel gaze-guided denoising diffusion model to generate stochastic human motions. Our method first uses a graph attention network to learn the spatio-temporal correlations between eye gaze and human movements and to fuse them into cross-modal gaze-motion features. These cross-modal features are injected into a noise prediction network via a cross-attention mechanism and progressively denoised to generate realistic human full-body motions. Experimental results on the MoGaze and GIMO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in terms of average displacement error (15.03% on MoGaze and 9.20% on GIMO). We further conducted an online user study to compare our method with state-of-the-art methods and the responses from 23 participants validate that the motions generated by our method are more realistic than those from other methods. Taken together, our work makes a first important step towards gaze-guided stochastic human motion prediction and guides future work on this important topic in VR research. ",

    "abstract": "While significant progress has been achieved in LiDAR-based perception, domain generalization continues to present challenges, often resulting in reduced performance when encountering unfamiliar datasets due to domain discrepancies. One of the primary hurdles stems from the variability of LiDAR sensors, leading to inconsistencies in point cloud density distribution. Such inconsistencies can undermine the effectiveness of perception models. We address this challenge by introducing a new approach that acknowledges a fundamental characteristic of LiDAR: the variation in point density due to the distance from the LiDAR to the scene, and the number of beams relative to the field of view. Understanding this, we view each LiDAR's point cloud at various distances as having distinct density distributions, which can be consistent across different LiDAR models. With this insight, we propose the Density Discriminative Feature Embedding (DDFE) module, crafted to specifically extract features related to density while ensuring domain invariance across different LiDAR sensors. In addition, we introduce a straightforward but effective density augmentation technique, designed to broaden the density spectrum and enhance the capabilities of the DDFE. The proposed DDFE stands out as a versatile and lightweight domain generalization module. It can be seamlessly integrated into various 3D backbone networks, consistently outperforming existing state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches. We commit to releasing the source code publicly to foster community collaboration and advancement. ",

Two years ago, we introduced GraphScope as a system addressing a wide array of graph computing needs, including graph traversal, analytics, and learning in one system.

However, one key lesson from this journey has been understanding the limitations of a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach, especially when dealing with the diversity of programming interfaces, applications, and data storage formats in graph computing. In response to these challenges, we present GraphScope Flex, the next iteration of GraphScope. GraphScope Flex is designed to be both resource-efficient and cost-effective, while also providing flexibility and user-friendliness through its LEGO-like modularity. This paper explores the architectural innovations and fundamental design principles of GraphScope Flex, all of which are direct outcomes of the lessons learned during our ongoing development process. We validate the adaptability and efficiency of GraphScope Flex with extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that GraphScope Flex achieves 2.4X throughput and up to 55.7X speedup over other systems on the LDBC Social Network and Graphalytics benchmarks, respectively.

    "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) in low-data settings remains an underappreciated yet crucial problem. This challenge is pronounced in low-to-middle income countries where access to large datasets is often limited or even absent. Hence, data augmentation methods to increase the sample size of datasets needed for ML are key to unlocking the transformative potential of ML in data-deprived regions and domains. Unfortunately, the limited training set constrains traditional tabular synthetic data generators in their ability to generate a large and diverse augmented dataset needed for ML tasks. To address this technical challenge, we introduce CLLM, which leverages the prior knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) for data augmentation in the low-data regime. While diverse, not all the data generated by LLMs will help increase utility for a downstream task, as for any generative model. Consequently, we introduce a principled curation process, leveraging learning dynamics, coupled with confidence and uncertainty metrics, to obtain a high-quality dataset. Empirically, on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of LLMs in the low-data regime compared to conventional generators. We further show our curation mechanism improves the downstream performance for all generators, including LLMs. Additionally, we provide insights and understanding into the LLM generation and curation mechanism, shedding light on the features that enable them to output high-quality augmented datasets. CLLM paves the way for wider usage of ML in data scarce domains and regions, by allying the strengths of LLMs with a robust data-centric approach. ",

However, it is challenging for NeRF to synthesize high-quality high-resolution novel views with low-resolution training data. To solve this problem, we propose a zero-shot super-resolution training framework for NeRF. This framework aims to guide the NeRF model to synthesize high-resolution novel views via single-scene internal learning rather than requiring any external high-resolution training data. Our approach consists of two stages. First, we learn a scene-specific degradation mapping by performing internal learning on a pretrained low-resolution coarse NeRF. Second, we optimize a super-resolution fine NeRF by conducting inverse rendering with our mapping function so as to backpropagate the gradients from low-resolution 2D space into the super-resolution 3D sampling space. Then, we further introduce a temporal ensemble strategy in the inference phase to compensate for the scene estimation errors. Our method is featured on two points: (1) it does not consume high-resolution views or additional scene data to train super-resolution NeRF; (2) it can speed up the training process by adopting a coarse-to-fine strategy. By conducting extensive experiments on public datasets, we have qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. ",

    "abstract": "Automated vehicles are envisioned to navigate safely in complex mixed-traffic scenarios alongside human-driven vehicles. To promise a high degree of safety, accurately predicting the maneuvers of surrounding vehicles and their future positions is a critical task and attracts much attention. However, most existing studies focused on reasoning about positional information based on objective historical trajectories without fully considering the heterogeneity of driving behaviors. Therefore, this study proposes a trajectory prediction framework that combines Mixture Density Networks (MDN) and considers the driving heterogeneity to provide probabilistic and personalized predictions. Specifically, based on a certain length of historical trajectory data, the situation-specific driving preferences of each driver are identified, where key driving behavior feature vectors are extracted to characterize heterogeneity in driving behavior among different drivers. With the inputs of the short-term historical trajectory data and key driving behavior feature vectors, a probabilistic LSTMMD-DBV model combined with LSTM-based encoder-decoder networks and MDN layers is utilized to carry out personalized predictions. Finally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method is employed to interpret the trained model for predictions. The proposed framework is tested based on a wide-range vehicle trajectory dataset. The results indicate that the proposed model can generate probabilistic future trajectories with remarkably improved predictions compared to existing benchmark models. Moreover, the results confirm that the additional input of driving behavior feature vectors representing the heterogeneity of driving behavior could provide more information and thus contribute to improving the prediction accuracy.

    "abstract": "3D perception is a critical problem in autonomous driving. Recently, the Bird-Eye-View (BEV) approach has attracted extensive attention, due to low-cost deployment and desirable vision detection capacity. However, the existing models ignore a realistic scenario during the driving procedure, i.e., one or more view cameras may be failed, which largely deteriorates the performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a generic Masked BEV (M-BEV) perception framework, which can effectively improve robustness to this challenging scenario, by random masking and reconstructing camera views in the end-to-end training. More specifically, we develop a novel Masked View Reconstruction (MVR) module for M-BEV. It mimics various missing cases by randomly masking features of different camera views, then leverages the original features of these views as self-supervision, and reconstructs the masked ones with the distinct spatio-temporal context across views. Via such a plug-and-play MVR, our M-BEV is capable of learning the missing views from the resting ones, and thus well generalized for robust view recovery and accurate perception in the testing. We perform extensive experiments on the popular NuScenes benchmark, where our framework can significantly boost 3D perception performance of the state-of-the-art models on various missing view cases, e.g., for the absence of back view, our M-BEV promotes the PETRv2 model with 10.3% mAP gain.

Teacher behavior is learned by maximizing the teacher and student cross-correlation matrix between their representations towards identity. Noise robustness is encouraged via the student's self-correlation minimization. The proposed method is agnostic of the teacher model and consistently outperforms the previous approach.

As hierarchy is introduced as a new inductive bias into the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in various tasks, it implies latent topological relations for attackers to improve their inference attack performance, leading to serious privacy leakage issues. In addition, existing privacy-preserving frameworks suffer from reduced protection ability in hierarchical propagation due to the deficiency of adaptive upper-bound estimation of the hierarchical perturbation boundary. It is of great urgency to effectively leverage the hierarchical property of data while satisfying privacy guarantees. To solve the problem, we propose the Poincar\\'e Differential Privacy framework, named PoinDP, to protect the hierarchy-aware graph embedding based on hyperbolic geometry. Specifically, PoinDP first learns the hierarchy weights for each entity based on the Poincar\\'e model in hyperbolic space. Then, the Personalized Hierarchy-aware Sensitivity is designed to measure the sensitivity of the hierarchical structure and adaptively allocate the privacy protection strength. Besides, the Hyperbolic Gaussian Mechanism (HGM) is proposed to extend the Gaussian mechanism in Euclidean space to hyperbolic space to realize random perturbations that satisfy differential privacy under the hyperbolic space metric. Extensive experiment results on five real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed PoinDP's advantages of effective privacy protection while maintaining good performance on the node classification task.

In these heterogeneous contexts, the graph topology admits a block structure. We study social learning under personalized (or multitask) models and examine their convergence behavior. ",

    "title": "Identification of Causal Structure in the Presence of Missing Data with  Additive Noise Model",
    "abstract": "Missing data are an unavoidable complication frequently encountered in many causal discovery tasks. When a missing process depends on the missing values themselves (known as self-masking missingness), the recovery of the joint distribution becomes unattainable, and detecting the presence of such self-masking missingness remains a perplexing challenge. Consequently, due to the inability to reconstruct the original distribution and to discern the underlying missingness mechanism, simply applying existing causal discovery methods would lead to wrong conclusions. In this work, we found that the recent advances additive noise model has the potential for learning causal structure under the existence of the self-masking missingness. With this observation, we aim to investigate the identification problem of learning causal structure from missing data under an additive noise model with different missingness mechanisms, where the `no self-masking missingness' assumption can be eliminated appropriately. Specifically, we first elegantly extend the scope of identifiability of causal skeleton to the case with weak self-masking missingness (i.e., no other variable could be the cause of self-masking indicators except itself). We further provide the sufficient and necessary identification conditions of the causal direction under additive noise model and show that the causal structure can be identified up to an IN-equivalent pattern. We finally propose a practical algorithm based on the above theoretical results on learning the causal skeleton and causal direction. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. ",

    "abstract": "Data sharing is a necessity for innovative progress in many domains, especially in healthcare. However, the ability to share data is hindered by regulations protecting the privacy of natural persons. Synthetic tabular data provide a promising solution to address data sharing difficulties but does not inherently guarantee privacy. Still, there is a lack of agreement on appropriate methods for assessing the privacy-preserving capabilities of synthetic data, making it difficult to compare results across studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to identify properties that constitute good universal privacy evaluation metrics for synthetic tabular data. The goal of such metrics is to enable comparability across studies and to allow non-technical stakeholders to understand how privacy is protected. We identify four principles for the assessment of metrics: Comparability, Applicability, Interpretability, and Representativeness (CAIR). To quantify and rank the degree to which evaluation metrics conform to the CAIR principles, we design a rubric using a scale of 1-4. Each of the four properties is scored on four parameters, yielding 16 total dimensions. We study the applicability and usefulness of the CAIR principles and rubric by assessing a selection of metrics popular in other studies. The results provide granular insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing metrics that not only rank the metrics but highlight areas of potential improvements. We expect that the CAIR principles will foster agreement among researchers and organizations on which universal privacy evaluation metrics are appropriate for synthetic tabular data. ",

    "abstract": "Group equivariance ensures consistent responses to group transformations of the input, leading to more robust models and enhanced generalization capabilities. However, this property can lead to overly constrained models if the symmetries considered in the group differ from those observed in data. While common methods address this by determining the appropriate level of symmetry at the dataset level, they are limited to supervised settings and ignore scenarios in which multiple levels of symmetry co-exist in the same dataset. For instance, pictures of cars and planes exhibit different levels of rotation, yet both are included in the CIFAR-10 dataset. In this paper, we propose a method able to detect the level of symmetry of each input without the need for labels. To this end, we derive a sufficient and necessary condition to learn the distribution of symmetries in the data. Using the learned distribution, we generate pseudo-labels that allow us to learn the levels of symmetry of each input in a self-supervised manner. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic datasets with different per-class levels of symmetries e.g. MNISTMultiple, in which digits are uniformly rotated within a class-dependent interval. We demonstrate that our method can be used for practical applications such as the generation of standardized datasets in which the symmetries are not present, as well as the detection of out-of-distribution symmetries during inference. By doing so, both the generalization and robustness of non-equivariant models can be improved. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/aurban0/ssl-sym. ",

They showed that the deterministic round complexity of any such problem is $O_{d,\\delta}(1)$, $\\Theta_{d,\\delta}(\\log n)$, or $\\Theta_{d,\\delta}(n)$, or the problem is unsolvable. However, their classification only addresses complexity as a function of $n$; here $O_{d,\\delta}$ hides constants that may depend on parameters $d$ and $\\delta$. In this work we study the complexity of binary labeling problems as a function of all three parameters: $n$, $d$, and $\\delta$. To this end, we introduce the family of structurally simple problems, which includes, among others, all binary labeling problems in which cardinality constraints can be represented with a context-free grammar. We classify possible complexities of structurally simple problems. As our main result, we show that if the complexity of a problem falls in the broad class of $\\Theta_{d,\\delta}(\\log n)$, then the complexity for each $d$ and $\\delta$ is always either $\\Theta(\\log_d n)$, $\\Theta(\\log_\\delta n)$, or $\\Theta(\\log n)$.

    "abstract": "There has been significant progress in improving the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) through enhancements in graph data, model architecture design, and training strategies. For fairness in graphs, recent studies achieve fair representations and predictions through either graph data pre-processing (e.g., node feature masking, and topology rewiring) or fair training strategies (e.g., regularization, adversarial debiasing, and fair contrastive learning). How to achieve fairness in graphs from the model architecture perspective is less explored. More importantly, GNNs exhibit worse fairness performance compared to multilayer perception since their model architecture (i.e., neighbor aggregation) amplifies biases. To this end, we aim to achieve fairness via a new GNN architecture. We propose \\textsf{F}air \\textsf{M}essage \\textsf{P}assing (FMP) designed within a unified optimization framework for GNNs. Notably, FMP \\textit{explicitly} renders sensitive attribute usage in \\textit{forward propagation} for node classification task using cross-entropy loss without data pre-processing. In FMP, the aggregation is first adopted to utilize neighbors' information and then the bias mitigation step explicitly pushes demographic group node presentation centers together. In this way, FMP scheme can aggregate useful information from neighbors and mitigate bias to achieve better fairness and prediction tradeoff performance. Experiments on node classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed FMP outperforms several baselines in terms of fairness and accuracy on three real-world datasets.

However, Transformers present large computational requirements for both training and inference, and are prone to overfitting during training. To address these challenges, we present Input Compression with Positional Consistency (ICPC), a new data augmentation method that, unlike prior augmentation techniques, simultaneously improves both generalization and training efficiency. ICPC applies varying levels of compression to each training sample in each epoch. This leads to smaller input sequences being processed by the Transformer, and hence faster training, while also alleviating overfitting by presenting each input with different compression levels. We introduce a consistency-aware position selection method in ICPC that enables accurate processing of compressed inputs without any changes to the underlying Transformer architecture. We detail compression-based augmentation methods for four different modalities -- insignificant word pruning for text, resolution modulation for images, spatio-temporal resolution modulation for videos, and spectogram size modulation for audio. ICPC also enables efficient variable-effort inference, where samples are first inferred at high compression levels, and progressively re-evaluated with lower compression for more challenging inputs. On 9 diverse tasks spanning 4 different modalities, ICPC improves accuracy by up to 1%, while also accelerating training and inference by up to 2.9X and 2.6X, respectively.

In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised open-vocabulary object detection framework, namely WSOVOD, to extend traditional WSOD to detect novel concepts and utilize diverse datasets with only image-level annotations. To achieve this, we explore three vital strategies, including dataset-level feature adaptation, image-level salient object localization, and region-level vision-language alignment. First, we perform data-aware feature extraction to produce an input-conditional coefficient, which is leveraged into dataset attribute prototypes to identify dataset bias and help achieve cross-dataset generalization. Second, a customized location-oriented weakly supervised region proposal network is proposed to utilize high-level semantic layouts from the category-agnostic segment anything model to distinguish object boundaries. Lastly, we introduce a proposal-concept synchronized multiple-instance network, i.e., object mining and refinement with visual-semantic alignment, to discover objects matched to the text embeddings of concepts. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and MS COCO demonstrate that the proposed WSOVOD achieves new state-of-the-art compared with previous WSOD methods in both close-set object localization and detection tasks. Meanwhile, WSOVOD enables cross-dataset and open-vocabulary learning to achieve on-par or even better performance than well-established fully-supervised open-vocabulary object detection (FSOVOD). ",

Recent developments in machine learning provide a promising avenue for better order parameters in complex systems that are challenging to study using traditional approaches. However, the application of machine learning to self-assembly on systems of particle shapes is still underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a simple, physics-agnostic, yet powerful approach that involves training a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a local environment classifier for systems of particle shapes, using input features such as particle distances and orientations. Our MLP classifier is trained in a supervised manner with a shape symmetry-encoded data augmentation technique without the need for any conventional roto-translations invariant symmetry functions. We evaluate the performance of our classifiers on four different scenarios involving self-assembly of cubic structures, 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional patchy particle shape systems, hexagonal bipyramids with varying aspect ratios, and truncated shapes with different degrees of truncation. The proposed training process and data augmentation technique are both straightforward and flexible, enabling easy application of the classifier to other processes involving particle orientations. Our work thus presents a valuable tool for investigating self-assembly processes on systems of particle shapes, with potential applications in structure identification of any particle-based or molecular system where orientations can be defined.

Forbidding holes of certain types in a graph has deep structural implications.

In 2002, Conforti, Cornu\\'{e}jols, Kapoor and Vu\\v{s}kov\\'{i}c provided a structural description of the class of even-hole-free graphs. In Chapter 3, we provide a structural description of all graphs that contain only holes of length $\\ell$ for every $\\ell \\geq 7$. Analysis of how holes interact with graph structure has yielded detection algorithms for holes of various lengths and parities. In 1991, Bienstock showed it is NP-Hard to test whether a graph G has an even (or odd) hole containing a specified vertex $v \\in V(G)$. In 2002, Conforti, Cornu\\'{e}jols, Kapoor and Vu\\v{s}kov\\'{i}c gave a polynomial-time algorithm to recognize even-hole-free graphs using their structure theorem.

In 2019, Chudnovsky, Scott, Seymour and Spirkl provided a polynomial-time algorithm to test whether a graph contains an odd hole. Later that year, Chudnovsky, Scott and Seymour strengthened this result by providing a polynomial-time algorithm to test whether a graph contains an odd hole of length at least $\\ell$ for any fixed integer $\\ell \\geq 5$. In Chapter 2, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to test whether a graph contains an even hole of length at least $\\ell$ for any fixed integer $\\ell \\geq 4$. ",

Deep neural networks, leveraging abundant data, advanced algorithms, and powerful computational capabilities, prove highly effective in the analysis and interpretation of images. In this context, Object detection methods have become a promising approach, particularly through convolutional neural networks (CNN), streamlining medical image analysis by eliminating manual feature extraction. This allows for direct feature extraction from images, ensuring high accuracy in results. Therefore, in our paper, we utilized the object detection method on X-ray angiography images to precisely identify the location of coronary artery stenosis. As a result, this model enables automatic and real-time detection of stenosis locations, assisting in the crucial and sensitive decision-making process for healthcare professionals. ",

    "abstract": "Detecting and classifying cells in histopathology H\\&E stained whole-slide images is a core task in computational pathology, as it provides valuable insight into the tumor microenvironment. In this work we investigate the impact of ground truth formats on the models performance. Additionally, cell-tissue interactions are considered by providing tissue segmentation predictions as input to the cell detection model. We find that a \"soft\", probability-map instance segmentation ground truth leads to best model performance. Combined with cell-tissue interaction and test-time augmentation our Soft Cell-Tissue-Model (SoftCTM) achieves 0.7172 mean F1-Score on the Overlapped Cell On Tissue (OCELOT) test set, achieving the third best overall score in the OCELOT 2023 Challenge. The source code for our approach is made publicly available at https://github.com/lely475/ocelot23algo. ",

    "abstract": "Dynamic networks offer an insight of how relational systems evolve. However, modeling these networks efficiently remains a challenge, primarily due to computational constraints, especially as the number of observed events grows. This paper addresses this issue by introducing the Deep Relational Event Additive Model (DREAM) as a solution to the computational challenges presented by modeling non-linear effects in Relational Event Models (REMs). DREAM relies on Neural Additive Models to model non-linear effects, allowing each effect to be captured by an independent neural network. By strategically trading computational complexity for improved memory management and leveraging the computational capabilities of Graphic Processor Units (GPUs), DREAM efficiently captures complex non-linear relationships within data. This approach demonstrates the capability of DREAM in modeling dynamic networks and scaling to larger networks. Comparisons with traditional REM approaches showcase DREAM superior computational efficiency. The model potential is further demonstrated by an examination of the patent citation network, which contains nearly 8 million nodes and 100 million events. ",
