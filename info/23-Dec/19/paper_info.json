    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel method to enhance sentiment analysis by addressing the challenge of context-specific word meanings. It combines the advantages of a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) with a knowledge graph's synonym data. This synergy leverages a dynamic attention mechanism to develop a knowledge-driven state vector. For classifying sentiments linked to specific aspects, the approach constructs a memory bank integrating positional data. This data is then analyzed using a multi-layer gated recurrent unit (GRU) to pinpoint sentiment characteristics related to specific aspect terms. Tests on three widely available datasets demonstrate this method's superior performance in sentiment classification. ",

    "abstract": "Ensuring fairness in Recommendation Systems (RSs) across demographic groups is critical due to the increased integration of RSs in applications such as personalized healthcare, finance, and e-commerce. Graph-based RSs play a crucial role in capturing intricate higher-order interactions among entities. However, integrating these graph models into the Federated Learning (FL) paradigm with fairness constraints poses formidable challenges as this requires access to the entire interaction graph and sensitive user information (such as gender, age, etc.) at the central server. This paper addresses the pervasive issue of inherent bias within RSs for different demographic groups without compromising the privacy of sensitive user attributes in FL environment with the graph-based model. To address the group bias, we propose F2PGNN (Fair Federated Personalized Graph Neural Network), a novel framework that leverages the power of Personalized Graph Neural Network (GNN) coupled with fairness considerations. Additionally, we use differential privacy techniques to fortify privacy protection. Experimental evaluation on three publicly available datasets showcases the efficacy of F2PGNN in mitigating group unfairness by 47% - 99% compared to the state-of-the-art while preserving privacy and maintaining the utility. The results validate the significance of our framework in achieving equitable and personalized recommendations using GNN within the FL landscape. ",

There is also a mixed and inconclusive debate on whether more online political participation in the youth increases their offline political participation. Methods: This study uses three models of OLS, two-way fixed effects, and an instrumental variable approach to make causal inferences about social media use, online, and offline political participation of the youth. Findings: The analyses provide evidence of a large effect of casual social media use on online political participation, and no effect or negligible effect on offline political participation and voting behavior. The results from fixed effects and instrumental variable models provide strong evidence of elasticity between online and offline political participation in young individuals. On average, a one percent increase in online political participation increases the offline political activity index by 0.12 percent. ",

Included articles focus on identifying individual information privacy concerns from the viewpoint of OGD stakeholders or providing solutions for mitigating concerns and risks. Papers that discussed and focused on general privacy issues or privacy concerns of open data in general or open science privacy concerns were excluded. Three streams of research were identified: 1) exploring privacy concerns and balance with OGD value propositions, 2) proposing solutions for mitigating privacy concerns, and 3) developing risk-based frameworks for the OGD program at different governmental levels. Findings suggest that contradictions with Fair Information Practices, reidentification risks, conflicts with OGD value propositions, and smart city data practices are significant privacy concerns in the literature.

While attention-based methods have shown significant progress in object detection in various domains, their application in medical object detection has been limited due to the unique challenges posed by medical imaging datasets. To address this issue, we propose ADA-YOLO, a light-weight yet effective method for medical object detection that integrates attention-based mechanisms with the YOLOv8 architecture. Our proposed method leverages the dynamic feature localisation and parallel regression for computer vision tasks through \\textit{adaptive head} module. Empirical experiments were conducted on the Blood Cell Count and Detection (BCCD) dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of ADA-YOLO. The results showed that ADA-YOLO outperforms the YOLOv8 model in mAP (mean average precision) on the BCCD dataset by using more than 3 times less space than YOLOv8. This indicates that our proposed method is effective. Moreover, the light-weight nature of our proposed method makes it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments such as mobile devices or edge computing systems. which could ultimately lead to improved diagnosis and treatment outcomes in the field of hematology.

We formalize the notion of context as a permutation-invariant representation of a set of data points that originate from the same environment/domain as the input itself. These representations are jointly learned with a standard supervised learning objective, providing incremental information about the unknown outcome. Furthermore, we offer a theoretical analysis of the conditions under which our approach can, in principle, yield benefits, and formulate two necessary criteria that can be easily verified in practice. Additionally, we contribute insights into the kind of distribution shifts for which our approach promises robustness. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for both low-dimensional and high-dimensional data sets. Finally, we demonstrate that we can reliably detect scenarios where a model is tasked with unwarranted extrapolation in out-of-distribution (OOD) domains, identifying potential failure cases. Consequently, we showcase a method to select between the most predictive and the most robust model, circumventing the well-known trade-off between predictive performance and robustness. ",

The distribution of real sRGB noise is highly complex and affected by a multitude of factors, making its accurate modeling extremely challenging. Therefore, recent studies have proposed methods that employ data-driven generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GAN) and Normalizing Flows. These studies achieve more accurate modeling of sRGB noise compared to traditional noise modeling methods. However, there are performance limitations due to the inherent characteristics of each generative model. To address this issue, we propose NM-FlowGAN, a hybrid approach that exploits the strengths of both GAN and Normalizing Flows. We simultaneously employ a pixel-wise noise modeling network based on Normalizing Flows, and spatial correlation modeling networks based on GAN. In our experiments, our NM-FlowGAN outperforms other baselines on the sRGB noise synthesis task.

However, it often struggles with moving objects that violate the static scene assumption during training. To address this issue, we introduce a coarse-to-fine training strategy leveraging the ground contacting prior based on the observation that most moving objects in outdoor scenes contact the ground. In the coarse training stage, we exclude the objects in dynamic classes from the reprojection loss calculation to avoid inaccurate depth learning. To provide precise supervision on the depth of the objects, we present a novel Ground-contacting-prior Disparity Smoothness Loss (GDS-Loss) that encourages a DE network to align the depth of the objects with their ground-contacting points. Subsequently, in the fine training stage, we refine the DE network to learn the detailed depth of the objects from the reprojection loss, while ensuring accurate DE on the moving object regions by employing our regularization loss with a cost-volume-based weighting factor. Our overall coarse-to-fine training strategy can easily be integrated with existing DE methods without any modifications, significantly enhancing DE performance on challenging Cityscapes and KITTI datasets, especially in the moving object regions.

In this work, we show how to efficiently establish, at test-time, a solid tradeoff between robustness and accuracy when mitigating query-based attacks. Given that these attacks necessarily explore low-confidence regions, our insight is that activating dedicated defenses, such as RND (Qin et al., NeuRIPS 2021) and Random Image Transformations (Xie et al., ICLR 2018), only for low-confidence inputs is sufficient to prevent them. Our approach is independent of training and supported by theory. We verify the effectiveness of our approach for various existing defenses by conducting extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Our results confirm that our proposal can indeed enhance these defenses by providing better tradeoffs between robustness and accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art approaches while being completely training-free.

Yet, most prior research has focused on modeling implicit and explicit human behavior in isolation. Can we build a unified model of human attention and preference behavior that reliably works across diverse types of visual content? Such a model would enable predicting subjective feedback such as overall satisfaction or aesthetic quality ratings, along with the underlying human attention or interaction heatmaps and viewing order, enabling designers and content-creation models to optimize their creation for human-centric improvements. In this paper, we propose UniAR -- a unified model that predicts both implicit and explicit human behavior across different types of visual content. UniAR leverages a multimodal transformer, featuring distinct prediction heads for each facet, and predicts attention heatmap, scanpath or viewing order, and subjective rating/preference. We train UniAR on diverse public datasets spanning natural images, web pages and graphic designs, and achieve leading performance on multiple benchmarks across different image domains and various behavior modeling tasks. Potential applications include providing instant feedback on the effectiveness of UIs/digital designs/images, and serving as a reward model to further optimize design/image creation. ",

In this paper, we introduce SoloPose, a novel one-shot, many-to-many spatio-temporal transformer model for kinematic 3D human pose estimation of video. SoloPose is further fortified by HeatPose, a 3D heatmap based on Gaussian Mixture Model distributions that factors target key points as well as kinematically adjacent key points.

Despite the significant potential of active perception, it poses several challenges, primarily involving significant changes in training pipelines for deep learning models. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose a generic supervised active perception pipeline for object detection that can be trained using existing off-the-shelf object detectors, while also leveraging advances in simulation environments. To this end, the proposed method employs an additional neural network architecture that estimates better viewpoints in cases where the object detector confidence is insufficient.

    "abstract": "Humans' internal states play a key role in human-machine interaction, leading to the rise of human state estimation as a prominent field. Compared to swift state changes such as surprise and irritation, modeling gradual states like trust and satisfaction are further challenged by label sparsity: long time-series signals are usually associated with a single label, making it difficult to identify the critical span of state shifts. Windowing has been one widely-used technique to enable localized analysis of long time-series data. However, the performance of downstream models can be sensitive to the window size, and determining the optimal window size demands domain expertise and extensive search. To address this challenge, we propose a Selective Windowing Attention Network (SWAN), which employs window prompts and masked attention transformation to enable the selection of attended intervals with flexible lengths. We evaluate SWAN on the task of trust prediction on a new multimodal driving simulation dataset. Experiments show that SWAN significantly outperforms an existing empirical window selection baseline and neural network baselines including CNN-LSTM and Transformer. Furthermore, it shows robustness across a wide span of windowing ranges, compared to the traditional windowing approach. ",

Consequently, scholars have been actively investigating efficacious self-supervised pre-training strategies, e.g. contrasting learning and reconstruction-based pretext tasks. Nevertheless, temporal information, which is inherent in the LiDAR point cloud sequence, is consistently disregarded. To better utilize this property, we propose an effective pre-training strategy, namely Temporal Masked AutoEncoders (T-MAE), which takes as input temporally adjacent frames and learns temporal dependency. A SiamWCA backbone, containing a Siamese encoder and a window-based cross-attention (WCA) module, is established for the two-frame input. Taking into account that the motion of an ego-vehicle alters the illumination angles of the same instance, temporal modeling also serves as a robust and natural data augmentation, enhancing the comprehension of target objects. Moreover, instead of utilizing consecutive frames, it is more cost-effective and powerful by using distant historical frames. SiamWCA is a powerful architecture but heavily relies on annotated data. With our T-MAE pre-training strategy, we achieve the best performance on the Waymo dataset among self-supervised learning methods. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to validate all components of our proposal. Upon acceptance, the source code will be made accessible. ",

    "abstract": "Symmetries in a dynamical system provide an opportunity to dramatically improve the performance of data-driven models. For fluid flows, such models are needed for tasks related to design, understanding, prediction, and control. In this work we exploit the symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations (NSE) and use simulation data to find the manifold where the long-time dynamics live, which has many fewer degrees of freedom than the full state representation, and the evolution equation for the dynamics on that manifold. We call this method ''symmetry charting''. The first step is to map to a ''fundamental chart'', which is a region in the state space of the flow to which all other regions can be mapped by a symmetry operation. To map to the fundamental chart we identify a set of indicators from the Fourier transform that uniquely identify the symmetries of the system. We then find a low-dimensional coordinate representation of the data in the fundamental chart with the use of an autoencoder. We use a variation called an implicit rank minimizing autoencoder with weight decay, which in addition to compressing the dimension of the data, also gives estimates of how many dimensions are needed to represent the data: i.e. the dimension of the invariant manifold of the long-time dynamics. Finally, we learn dynamics on this manifold with the use of neural ordinary differential equations. We apply symmetry charting to two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow in a chaotic bursting regime. This system has a continuous translation symmetry, and discrete rotation and shift-reflect symmetries. With this framework we observe that less data is needed to learn accurate data-driven models, more robust estimates of the manifold dimension are obtained, equivariance of the NSE is satisfied, better short-time tracking with respect to the true data is observed, and long-time statistics are correctly captured.

Consolidating sensitive medical data is not always an option particularly due to the stringent privacy regulations imposed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). In this paper, we introduce a HIPAA compliant framework that can train from distributed data. We then propose a multimodal vertical federated model for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection, a serious neurodegenerative condition that can cause dementia, severely impairing brain function and hindering simple tasks, especially without preventative care. This vertical federated model offers a distributed architecture that enables collaborative learning across diverse sources of medical data while respecting privacy constraints imposed by HIPAA. It is also able to leverage multiple modalities of data, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of AD detection. Our proposed model not only contributes to the advancement of federated learning techniques but also holds promise for overcoming the hurdles posed by data segmentation in medical research. By using vertical federated learning, this research strives to provide a framework that enables healthcare institutions to harness the collective intelligence embedded in their distributed datasets without compromising patient privacy.

    "abstract": "Modern operating room is becoming increasingly complex, requiring innovative intra-operative support systems. While the focus of surgical data science has largely been on video analysis, integrating surgical computer vision with language capabilities is emerging as a necessity. Our work aims to advance Visual Question Answering (VQA) in the surgical context with scene graph knowledge, addressing two main challenges in the current surgical VQA systems: removing question-condition bias in the surgical VQA dataset and incorporating scene-aware reasoning in the surgical VQA model design. First, we propose a Surgical Scene Graph-based dataset, SSG-QA, generated by employing segmentation and detection models on publicly available datasets. We build surgical scene graphs using spatial and action information of instruments and anatomies. These graphs are fed into a question engine, generating diverse QA pairs. Our SSG-QA dataset provides a more complex, diverse, geometrically grounded, unbiased, and surgical action-oriented dataset compared to existing surgical VQA datasets. We then propose SSG-QA-Net, a novel surgical VQA model incorporating a lightweight Scene-embedded Interaction Module (SIM), which integrates geometric scene knowledge in the VQA model design by employing cross-attention between the textual and the scene features. Our comprehensive analysis of the SSG-QA dataset shows that SSG-QA-Net outperforms existing methods across different question types and complexities. We highlight that the primary limitation in the current surgical VQA systems is the lack of scene knowledge to answer complex queries. We present a novel surgical VQA dataset and model and show that results can be significantly improved by incorporating geometric scene features in the VQA model design. The source code and the dataset will be made publicly available at: https://github.com/CAMMA-public/SSG-QA ",

Over the past two years, much work has gone into the development of PINNs capable of solving the gravity field modeling problem -- i.e.\\ learning a differentiable form of the gravitational potential from position and acceleration estimates. While the past PINN gravity models (PINN-GMs) have demonstrated advantages in model compactness, robustness to noise, and sample efficiency; there remain key modeling challenges which this paper aims to address. Specifically, this paper introduces the third generation of the Physics-Informed Neural Network Gravity Model (PINN-GM-III) which solves the problems of extrapolation error, bias towards low-altitude samples, numerical instability at high-altitudes, and compliant boundary conditions through numerous modifications to the model's design. The PINN-GM-III is tested by modeling a known heterogeneous density asteroid, and its performance is evaluated using seven core metrics which showcases its strengths against its predecessors and other analytic and numerical gravity models.

However, the question of complicating diseases is neglected among all these methods. In this paper, we propose a novel EHR coding framework, which is the first attempt at detecting complicating diseases, called Copy Recurrent Neural Network Structure Network (CRNNet). This method refers to the idea of adversarial learning; a Path Generator and a Path Discriminator are designed to more efficiently finish the task of EHR coding. We propose a copy module to detect complicating diseases; by the proposed copy module and the adversarial learning strategy, we identify complicating diseases efficiently. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 57.30\\% ratio of complicating diseases in predictions, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed model.

From its inception, this centralized database has sparked scholarly interest as an unprecedented and potentially unique trove of data on real-world online moderation. Here, we thoroughly analyze all 195.61M records submitted by the eight largest social media platforms in the EU during the first 60 days of the database. Specifically, we conduct a platform-wise comparative study of their: volume of moderation actions, grounds for decision, types of applied restrictions, types of moderated content, timeliness in undertaking and submitting moderation actions, and use of automation. Furthermore, we systematically cross-check the contents of the database with the platforms' own transparency reports. Our analyses reveal that (i) the platforms adhered only in part to the philosophy and structure of the database, (ii) the structure of the database is partially inadequate for the platforms' reporting needs, (iii) the platforms exhibited substantial differences in their moderation actions, (iv) a remarkable fraction of the database data is inconsistent, (v) the platform X (formerly Twitter) presents the most inconsistencies. Our findings have far-reaching implications for policymakers and scholars across diverse disciplines.

Specifically, we develop a novel embedding model, which measures the similarity between mouse trajectories collected during the session and when registering/solving CAPTCHA, to authenticate and detect identity inconsistency. Moreover, unlike most existing works that employ a separate mouse movement classifier for each individual user, which brings in considerable costs when serving a large number of users, our model performs detection tasks using only one classifier for all users, significantly reducing the cost. Experiment results validate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art time series classification methods, achieving 94.3% and 97.7% of AUC in identity and authentication inconsistency detection, respectively.

In this paper, however, we present a neural operator-based method to define the time-derivative term. Neural operators were initially proposed to model the differential operator of partial differential equations (PDEs). Since the time-derivative of NODEs can be understood as a special type of the differential operator, our proposed method, called branched Fourier neural operator (BFNO), makes sense.

RL is also very brittle; agents often overfit to their training environment and fail to generalize to new settings. Unsupervised environment design (UED) has been proposed as a solution to this problem, in which the agent trains in environments that have been specially selected to help it learn. Previous UED algorithms focus on trying to train an RL agent that generalizes across a large distribution of environments. This is not necessarily desirable when we wish to prioritize performance in one environment over others. In this work, we will be examining the setting of robust RL building control, where we wish to train an RL agent that prioritizes performing well in normal weather while still being robust to extreme weather conditions. We demonstrate a novel UED algorithm, ActivePLR, that uses uncertainty-aware neural network architectures to generate new training environments at the limit of the RL agent's ability while being able to prioritize performance in a desired base environment. We show that ActivePLR is able to outperform state-of-the-art UED algorithms in minimizing energy usage while maximizing occupant comfort in the setting of building control. ",

In many real-world scenarios, inductive link prediction is required, where predictions have to be made among unseen entities. Embedding-based models usually need fine-tuning on new entity embeddings, and hence are difficult to be directly applied to inductive link prediction tasks. Logical rules captured by rule-based models can be directly applied to new entities with the same graph typologies, but the captured rules are discrete and usually lack generosity. Graph neural networks (GNNs) can generalize topological information to new graphs taking advantage of deep neural networks, which however may still need fine-tuning on new entity embeddings. In this paper, we propose SiaILP, a path-based model for inductive link prediction using siamese neural networks. Our model only depends on relation and path embeddings, which can be generalized to new entities without fine-tuning.

To do so, we use the middleware architecture proposed by article [8] in which a device, called the middleware, acts as the middleman between the various IoT networks and the cloud. Since IoT devices typically operate in real-time, performance is of great concern. Therefore, we conducted a simulation to measure the data latency of using middleware and the overall fairness between different IoT networks. Our simulation had an MQTT and a CoAP network interacting with the middleware. The simulation results showed that CoAP always had a lower travel time than MQTT, mainly because CoAP is a more lightweight protocol. However, we also found that MQTT had slightly more throughput, which was unexpected since we initially thought that CoAP would have had higher throughput. We have shown that analyzing data via a middleware device is possible and that there are potential directions to explore, such as evaluating different Quality of Service Algorithms in the context of having a middleware device.

Our approach tackles this issue through a two-phase process, utilizing a reference speech encoding network and a global information disentanglement network to gradually disentangle the speaker identity information from other irrelevant factors. We exclusively employ the disentangled speaker identity information to guide the speech extraction network. Moreover, we introduce the adaptive modulation Transformer to ensure that the acoustic representation of the mixed signal remains undisturbed by the speaker embeddings. This component incorporates speaker embeddings as conditional information, facilitating natural and efficient guidance for the speech extraction network. Experimental results substantiate the effectiveness of our meticulously crafted approach, showcasing a substantial reduction in the likelihood of speaker confusion. ",

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used for automatic cell type classification, which is a fundamental problem to solve in scRNA-seq analysis. However, existing methods do not sufficiently exploit both gene-gene and cell-cell relationships, and thus the true potential of GNNs is not realized. In this work, we propose a bilevel graph representation learning method, named scBiGNN, to simultaneously mine the relationships at both gene and cell levels for more accurate single-cell classification. Specifically, scBiGNN comprises two GNN modules to identify cell types. A gene-level GNN is established to adaptively learn gene-gene interactions and cell representations via the self-attention mechanism, and a cell-level GNN builds on the cell-cell graph that is constructed from the cell representations generated by the gene-level GNN. To tackle the scalability issue for processing a large number of cells, scBiGNN adopts an Expectation Maximization (EM) framework in which the two modules are alternately trained via the E-step and M-step to learn from each other. Through this interaction, the gene- and cell-level structural information is integrated to gradually enhance the classification performance of both GNN modules. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our scBiGNN outperforms a variety of existing methods for cell type classification from scRNA-seq data. ",

Based on the foundation of brain network, spatial-temporal-based graph convolutional networks have dramatically improved the performance of deep learning methods in rs-fMRI time series classification. However, existing works either pre-define the brain network as the correlation matrix derived from the raw time series or jointly learn the connectome and model parameters without any topology constraint. These methods could suffer from degraded classification performance caused by the deviation from the intrinsic brain connectivity and lack biological interpretability of demonstrating the causal structure (i.e., effective connectivity) among brain regions. Moreover, most existing methods for effective connectivity learning are unaware of the downstream classification task and cannot sufficiently exploit useful rs-fMRI label information. To address these issues in an end-to-end manner, we model the brain network as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to discover direct causal connections between brain regions and propose Spatial-Temporal DAG Convolutional Network (ST-DAGCN) to jointly infer effective connectivity and classify rs-fMRI time series by learning brain representations based on nonlinear structural equation model. The optimization problem is formulated into a continuous program and solved with score-based learning method via gradient descent. We evaluate ST-DAGCN on two public rs-fMRI databases. Experiments show that ST-DAGCN outperforms existing models by evident margins in rs-fMRI classification and simultaneously learns meaningful edges of effective connectivity that help understand brain activity patterns and pathological mechanisms in brain disease.

But their predictions can easily be manipulated using adversarial examples, which are crafted by adding imperceptible perturbations to legitimate documents. This vulnerability raises significant concerns about their reliability and hinders the widespread deployment of NRMs. By incorporating adversarial examples into training data, adversarial training has become the de facto defense approach to adversarial attacks against NRMs. However, this defense mechanism is subject to a trade-off between effectiveness and adversarial robustness. In this study, we establish theoretical guarantees regarding the effectiveness-robustness trade-off in NRMs. We decompose the robust ranking error into two components, i.e., a natural ranking error for effectiveness evaluation and a boundary ranking error for assessing adversarial robustness. Then, we define the perturbation invariance of a ranking model and prove it to be a differentiable upper bound on the boundary ranking error for attainable computation. Informed by our theoretical analysis, we design a novel \\emph{perturbation-invariant adversarial training} (PIAT) method for ranking models to achieve a better effectiveness-robustness trade-off. We design a regularized surrogate loss, in which one term encourages the effectiveness to be maximized while the regularization term encourages the output to be smooth, so as to improve adversarial robustness. Experimental results on several ranking models demonstrate the superiority of PITA compared to existing adversarial defenses. ",

In particular, current cooperative fusion models rely on supervised models and do not address dynamic performance degradation caused by arbitrary channel impairments. In this paper, a self-supervised adaptive weighting model is proposed for intermediate fusion to mitigate the adverse effects of channel distortion. The performance of cooperative perception is investigated in different system settings. Rician fading and imperfect channel state information (CSI) are also considered. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive weighting algorithm significantly outperforms the benchmarks without weighting. Visualization examples validate that the proposed weighting algorithm can flexibly adapt to various channel conditions.

    "abstract": "With the development of fifth-generation (5G) networks, the number of user equipments (UE) increases dramatically. However, the potential health risks from electromagnetic fields (EMF) tend to be a public concern. Generally, EMF exposure-related analysis mainly considers the passive exposure from base stations (BSs) and active exposure that results from the user's personal devices while communicating. However, the passive radiation that is generated by nearby devices of other users is typically ignored. In fact, with the increase in the density of UE, their passive exposure to human bodies can no longer be ignored. In this work, we propose a stochastic geometry framework to analyze the EMF exposure from active and passive radiation sources. In particular, considering a typical user, we account for their exposure to EMF from BSs, their own UE, and other UE. We derive the distribution of the Exposure index (EI) and the coverage probability for two typical models for spatial distributions of UE, i.e., \\textit{i)} a Poisson point process (PPP); \\textit{ii)} a Matern cluster process. Also, we show the trade-off between the EMF exposure and the coverage probability. Our numerical results suggest that the passive exposure from other users is non-negligible compared to the exposure from BSs when user density is $10^2$ times higher than BS density, and non-negligible compared to active exposure from the user's own UE when user density is $10^5$ times the BS density.

    "abstract": "Human body reconstruction with Millimeter Wave (mmWave) radar point clouds has gained significant interest due to its ability to work in adverse environments and its capacity to mitigate privacy concerns associated with traditional camera-based solutions. Despite pioneering efforts in this field, two challenges persist. Firstly, raw point clouds contain massive noise points, usually caused by the ambient objects and multi-path effects of Radio Frequency (RF) signals. Recent approaches typically rely on prior knowledge or elaborate preprocessing methods, limiting their applicability. Secondly, even after noise removal, the sparse and inconsistent body-related points pose an obstacle to accurate human body reconstruction. To address these challenges, we introduce mmBaT, a novel multi-task deep learning framework that concurrently estimates the human body and predicts body translations in subsequent frames to extract body-related point clouds. Our method is evaluated on two public datasets that are collected with different radar devices and noise levels. A comprehensive comparison against other state-of-the-art methods demonstrates our method has a superior reconstruction performance and generalization ability from noisy raw data, even when compared to methods provided with body-related point clouds.

To succeed in this transition, convergence of 5G and time-sensitive networks (TSN) is the most promising technology and has thus attracted considerable interest from industry and standardization groups. However, the delay and jitter of end-to-end (e2e) transmission will get exacerbated if the transmission opportunities are missed in TSN due to the 5G transmission jitter and the clock skew between the two network systems. To mitigate this phenomenon, we propose a novel asynchronous access mechanism (AAM) that isolates the jitter only in the 5G system and ensures zero transmission jitter in TSN. We then exploit AAM to develop an e2e asynchronous traffic scheduling model for coordinated allocation of resources for 5G and TSN to provide e2e transmission delay guarantees for time-critical flows. The results of our extensive simulation of AAM on OMNET++ corroborate the superior performance of AAM and the scheduling model. ",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel definition for a small set R of k points being \"representative\" of a larger set in a metric space. Given a set V (e.g., documents or voters) to represent, and a set C of possible representatives, our criterion requires that for any subset S comprising a theta fraction of V, the average distance of S to their best theta*k points in R should not be more than a factor gamma compared to their average distance to the best theta*k points among all of C. This definition is a strengthening of proportional fairness and core fairness, but - different from those notions - requires that large cohesive clusters be represented proportionally to their size. Since there are instances for which - unless gamma is polynomially large - no solutions exist, we study this notion in a resource augmentation framework, implicitly stating the constraints for a set R of size k as though its size were only k/alpha, for alpha > 1. Furthermore, motivated by the application to elections, we mostly focus on the \"ordinal\" model, where the algorithm does not learn the actual distances; instead, it learns only for each point v in V and each candidate pairs c, c' which of c, c' is closer to v. Our main result is that the Expanding Approvals Rule (EAR) of Aziz and Lee is (alpha, gamma) representative with gamma <= 1 + 6.71 * (alpha)/(alpha-1). Our results lead to three notable byproducts. First, we show that the EAR achieves constant proportional fairness in the ordinal model, giving the first positive result on metric proportional fairness with ordinal information. Second, we show that for the core fairness objective, the EAR achieves the same asymptotic tradeoff between resource augmentation and approximation as the recent results of Li et al., which used full knowledge of the metric. Finally, our results imply a very simple single-winner voting rule with metric distortion at most 44. ",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to PDE boundary control design using neural operators to alleviate stop-and-go instabilities in congested traffic flow. Our framework leverages neural operators to design control strategies for traffic flow systems. The traffic dynamics are described by the Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model, which comprises a set of second-order coupled hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Backstepping method is widely used for boundary control of such PDE systems. The PDE model-based control design can be time-consuming and require intensive depth of expertise since it involves constructing and solving backstepping control kernels. To overcome these challenges, we present two distinct neural operator (NO) learning schemes aimed at stabilizing the traffic PDE system. The first scheme embeds NO-approximated gain kernels within a predefined backstepping controller, while the second one directly learns a boundary control law. The Lyapunov analysis is conducted to evaluate the stability of the NO-approximated gain kernels and control law. It is proved that the NO-based closed-loop system is practical stable under certain approximation accuracy conditions in NO-learning. To validate the efficacy of the proposed approach, simulations are conducted to compare the performance of the two neural operator controllers with a PDE backstepping controller and a Proportional Integral (PI) controller. While the NO-approximated methods exhibit higher errors compared to the backstepping controller, they consistently outperform the PI controller, demonstrating faster computation speeds across all scenarios. This result suggests that neural operators can significantly expedite and simplify the process of obtaining boundary controllers in traffic PDE systems. ",

To tackle these two challenges, we first introduce the variational information bottleneck (VIB) method for the cross-modal representation learning of missing modalities, which capitalizes on the available modalities and the labels as supervision. Then, accounting for the imbalanced missing rates, we define relative advantage to quantify the advantage of each modality over others.

The core of existing methods lies in how to select high-quality pseudo-labels using the designed quality evaluation criterion. However, these methods treat each pseudo bounding box as a whole and assign equal importance to each side during training, which is detrimental to model performance due to many sides having poor localization quality. Besides, existing methods filter out a large number of low-quality pseudo-labels, which also contain some correct regression values that can help with model training. To address the above issues, we propose a side-aware framework for semi-supervised 3D object detection consisting of three key designs: a 3D bounding box parameterization method, an uncertainty estimation module, and a pseudo-label selection strategy. These modules work together to explicitly estimate the localization quality of each side and assign different levels of importance during the training phase. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method can consistently outperform baseline models under different scenes and evaluation criteria.

    "abstract": "Graph contrastive learning is a general learning paradigm excelling at capturing invariant information from diverse perturbations in graphs. Recent works focus on exploring the structural rationale from graphs, thereby increasing the discriminability of the invariant information. However, such methods may incur in the mis-learning of graph models towards the interpretability of graphs, and thus the learned noisy and task-agnostic information interferes with the prediction of graphs. To this end, with the purpose of exploring the intrinsic rationale of graphs, we accordingly propose to capture the dimensional rationale from graphs, which has not received sufficient attention in the literature. The conducted exploratory experiments attest to the feasibility of the aforementioned roadmap. To elucidate the innate mechanism behind the performance improvement arising from the dimensional rationale, we rethink the dimensional rationale in graph contrastive learning from a causal perspective and further formalize the causality among the variables in the pre-training stage to build the corresponding structural causal model. On the basis of the understanding of the structural causal model, we propose the dimensional rationale-aware graph contrastive learning approach, which introduces a learnable dimensional rationale acquiring network and a redundancy reduction constraint. The learnable dimensional rationale acquiring network is updated by leveraging a bi-level meta-learning technique, and the redundancy reduction constraint disentangles the redundant features through a decorrelation process during learning. Empirically, compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method can yield significant performance boosts on various benchmarks with respect to discriminability and transferability.

In practice, due to the system and statistical heterogeneity among devices, synchronous FL often encounters the straggler effect. In contrast, asynchronous FL can mitigate this problem, making it suitable for scenarios involving numerous participants. However, Non-IID data and stale models present significant challenges to asynchronous FL, as they would diminish the practicality of the global model and even lead to training failures. In this work, we propose a novel asynchronous FL framework called Federated Historical Learning (FedHist), which effectively addresses the challenges posed by both Non-IID data and gradient staleness. FedHist enhances the stability of local gradients by performing weighted fusion with historical global gradients cached on the server. Relying on hindsight, it assigns aggregation weights to each participant in a multi-dimensional manner during each communication round. To further enhance the efficiency and stability of the training process, we introduce an intelligent $\\ell_2$-norm amplification scheme, which dynamically regulates the learning progress based on the $\\ell_2$-norms of the submitted gradients.

    "abstract": "Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to detect novel objects beyond a given set of base categories on which the detection model is trained. Recent OVOD methods focus on adapting the image-level pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to a region-level object detection task via, eg., region-level knowledge distillation, regional prompt learning, or region-text pre-training, to expand the detection vocabulary. These methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in recognizing regional visual concepts, but they are weak in exploiting the VLMs' powerful global scene understanding ability learned from the billion-scale image-level text descriptions. This limits their capability in detecting hard objects of small, blurred, or occluded appearance from novel/base categories, whose detection heavily relies on contextual information. To address this, we propose a novel approach, namely Simple Image-level Classification for Context-Aware Detection Scoring (SIC-CADS), to leverage the superior global knowledge yielded from CLIP for complementing the current OVOD models from a global perspective. The core of SIC-CADS is a multi-modal multi-label recognition (MLR) module that learns the object co-occurrence-based contextual information from CLIP to recognize all possible object categories in the scene. These image-level MLR scores can then be utilized to refine the instance-level detection scores of the current OVOD models in detecting those hard objects. This is verified by extensive empirical results on two popular benchmarks, OV-LVIS and OV-COCO, which show that SIC-CADS achieves significant and consistent improvement when combined with different types of OVOD models. Further, SIC-CADS also improves the cross-dataset generalization ability on Objects365 and OpenImages. The code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/SIC-CADS. ",

In parallel, weight \\emph{entanglement} has emerged as a technique for intricate parameter sharing among architectures within macro-level search spaces. %However, the macro structure of such spaces poses compatibility challenges for gradient-based NAS methods. %As a result, blackbox optimization methods have been commonly employed, particularly in conjunction with supernet training, to maintain search efficiency. %Due to the inherent differences in the structure of these search spaces, these Since weight-entanglement poses compatibility challenges for gradient-based NAS methods, these two paradigms have largely developed independently in parallel sub-communities. This paper aims to bridge the gap between these sub-communities by proposing a novel scheme to adapt gradient-based methods for weight-entangled spaces. This enables us to conduct an in-depth comparative assessment and analysis of the performance of gradient-based NAS in weight-entangled search spaces. Our findings reveal that this integration of weight-entanglement and gradient-based NAS brings forth the various benefits of gradient-based methods (enhanced performance, improved supernet training properties and superior any-time performance), while preserving the memory efficiency of weight-entangled spaces.

    "abstract": "The development of autoregressive modeling (AM) in computer vision lags behind natural language processing (NLP) in self-supervised pre-training. This is mainly caused by the challenge that images are not sequential signals and lack a natural order when applying autoregressive modeling. In this study, inspired by human beings' way of grasping an image, i.e., focusing on the main object first, we present a semantic-aware autoregressive image modeling (SemAIM) method to tackle this challenge. The key insight of SemAIM is to autoregressive model images from the semantic patches to the less semantic patches. To this end, we first calculate a semantic-aware permutation of patches according to their feature similarities and then perform the autoregression procedure based on the permutation. In addition, considering that the raw pixels of patches are low-level signals and are not ideal prediction targets for learning high-level semantic representation, we also explore utilizing the patch features as the prediction targets. Extensive experiments are conducted on a broad range of downstream tasks, including image classification, object detection, and instance/semantic segmentation, to evaluate the performance of SemAIM. The results demonstrate SemAIM achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with other self-supervised methods. Specifically, with ViT-B, SemAIM achieves 84.1% top-1 accuracy for fine-tuning on ImageNet, 51.3% AP and 45.4% AP for object detection and instance segmentation on COCO, which outperforms the vanilla MAE by 0.5%, 1.0%, and 0.5%, respectively.

Previous work has identified issues such as oversmoothing of the latent representation and have suggested solutions such as skip connections and sophisticated normalization schemes. Here, we propose a different approach that is based on a stratification of the graph nodes. We provide motivation that the nodes in a graph can be stratified into those with a low degree and those with a high degree and that the two groups are likely to behave differently. Based on this motivation, we modify the Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture so that the weight matrices are learned, separately, for the nodes in each group. This simple-to-implement modification seems to improve performance across datasets and GNN methods. To verify that this increase in performance is not only due to the added capacity, we also perform the same modification for random splits of the nodes, which does not lead to any improvement. ",

While the primary focus of deepfake detection has traditionally centered on the design of detection algorithms, an investigative inquiry into the generator architectures has remained conspicuously absent in recent years. This paper contributes to this lacuna by rethinking the architectures of CNN-based generators, thereby establishing a generalized representation of synthetic artifacts. Our findings illuminate that the up-sampling operator can, beyond frequency-based artifacts, produce generalized forgery artifacts. In particular, the local interdependence among image pixels caused by upsampling operators is significantly demonstrated in synthetic images generated by GAN or diffusion. Building upon this observation, we introduce the concept of Neighboring Pixel Relationships(NPR) as a means to capture and characterize the generalized structural artifacts stemming from up-sampling operations. A comprehensive analysis is conducted on an open-world dataset, comprising samples generated by \\tft{28 distinct generative models}.

Moreover, we propose a novel debiasing multimodal sarcasm detection framework with contrastive learning, which aims to mitigate the harmful effect of biased textual factors for robust OOD generalization. In particular, we first design counterfactual data augmentation to construct the positive samples with dissimilar word biases and negative samples with similar word biases.

    "abstract": "Given a dynamic graph, the efficient tracking of anomalous subgraphs via their node embeddings poses a significant challenge. Addressing this issue necessitates an effective scoring mechanism and an innovative anomalous subgraph strategy. Existing methods predominantly focus on designing scoring strategies or employing graph structures that consider nodes in isolation, resulting in ineffective capture of the anomalous subgraph structure information. In this paper, we introduce SUBANOM, a novel framework for subgraph anomaly detection that is adept at identifying anomalous subgraphs. SUBANOM has three key components: 1) We implement current state-of-the-art dynamic embedding methods to efficiently calculate node embeddings, thereby capturing all node-level anomalies successfully; 2) We devise novel subgraph identification strategies, which include k-hop and triadic-closure. These strategies form the crucial component that can proficiently differentiate between strong and weak neighbors, thus effectively capturing the anomaly structure information; 3) For qualifying the anomaly subgraphs, we propose using Lp-norm-based score aggregation functions. These iterative steps enable us to process large-scale dynamic graphs effectively. Experiments conducted on a real-world dynamic graph underscore the efficacy of our framework in detecting anomalous subgraphs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results further signify that our framework is a potent tool for identifying anomalous subgraphs in real-world scenarios. For instance, the F1 score under the optimal subgraph identification strategy, can peak at 0.6679, while the highest achievable score using the corresponding baseline method is 0.5677. ",

In recent two-stage FGOD methods, the region proposal serves as a crucial link between detection and fine-grained recognition. However, current methods overlook that some proposal-related procedures inherited from general detection are not equally suitable for FGOD, limiting the multi-task learning from generation, representation, to utilization. In this paper, we present PETDet (Proposal Enhancement for Two-stage fine-grained object detection) to better handle the sub-tasks in two-stage FGOD methods. Firstly, an anchor-free Quality Oriented Proposal Network (QOPN) is proposed with dynamic label assignment and attention-based decomposition to generate high-quality oriented proposals. Additionally, we present a Bilinear Channel Fusion Network (BCFN) to extract independent and discriminative features of the proposals. Furthermore, we design a novel Adaptive Recognition Loss (ARL) which offers guidance for the R-CNN head to focus on high-quality proposals. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PETDet. Quantitative analysis reveals that PETDet with ResNet50 reaches state-of-the-art performance on various FGOD datasets, including FAIR1M-v1.0 (42.96 AP), FAIR1M-v2.0 (48.81 AP), MAR20 (85.91 AP) and ShipRSImageNet (74.90 AP).

They correspond respectively to non-cooperative or cooperative scenarios, where the aim is to find the Nash equilibrium and social optimum. These frameworks provide approximate solutions to situations with a finite number of players and have found a wide range of applications, from economics to biology and machine learning. In this paper, we study how the players can pass from a non-cooperative to a cooperative regime, and vice versa. The first direction is reminiscent of mechanism design, in which the game's definition is modified so that non-cooperative players reach an outcome similar to a cooperative scenario. The second direction studies how players that are initially cooperative gradually deviate from a social optimum to reach a Nash equilibrium when they decide to optimize their individual cost similar to the free rider phenomenon. To formalize these connections, we introduce two new classes of games which lie between MFG and MFC: $\\lambda$-interpolated mean field games, in which the cost of an individual player is a $\\lambda$-interpolation of the MFG and the MFC costs, and $p$-partial mean field games, in which a proportion $p$ of the population deviates from the social optimum by playing the game non-cooperatively. We conclude the paper by providing an algorithm for myopic players to learn a $p$-partial mean field equilibrium, and we illustrate it on a stylized model. ",

Subsequently, a number of works have explored the use of NeFs as representations for downstream tasks, e.g. classifying an image based on the parameters of a NeF that has been fit to it. However, the impact of the NeF hyperparameters on their quality as downstream representation is scarcely understood and remains largely unexplored. This is in part caused by the large amount of time required to fit datasets of neural fields.

With this library, we perform a comprehensive study that investigates the effects of different hyperparameters -- including initialization, network architecture, and optimization strategies -- on fitting NeFs for downstream tasks. Our study provides valuable insights on how to train NeFs and offers guidance for optimizing their effectiveness in downstream applications. Finally, based on the proposed library and our analysis, we propose Neural Field Arena, a benchmark consisting of neural field variants of popular vision datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR, variants of ImageNet, and ShapeNetv2.

As these models find increasing use in safety-critical applications, it is important that not just the model predictions but also their explanations (as feature attributions) be robust to small human-imperceptible input perturbations. Recent works have shown that many attribution methods are fragile and have proposed improvements in either these methods or the model training. We observe two main causes for fragile attributions: first, the existing metrics of robustness (e.g., top-k intersection) over-penalize even reasonable local shifts in attribution, thereby making random perturbations to appear as a strong attack, and second, the attribution can be concentrated in a small region even when there are multiple important parts in an image. To rectify this, we propose simple ways to strengthen existing metrics and attribution methods that incorporate locality of pixels in robustness metrics and diversity of pixel locations in attributions. Towards the role of model training in attributional robustness, we empirically observe that adversarially trained models have more robust attributions on smaller datasets, however, this advantage disappears in larger datasets.

Such models can generate surface roughness of the shells in real-time, allowing the operator to make any necessary changes to the polishing for optimal result. ",

    "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been broadly applied to a large number of robotics tasks, such as robot manipulation and autonomous driving. However, an open problem in deep RL is learning policies that are robust to variations in the environment, which is an important condition for such systems to be deployed into real-world, unstructured settings. Curriculum learning is one approach that has been applied to improve generalization performance in both supervised and reinforcement learning domains, but selecting the appropriate curriculum to achieve robustness can be a user-intensive process. In our work, we show that performing probabilistic inference of the underlying curriculum-reward function using Bayesian Optimization can be a promising technique for finding a robust curriculum. We demonstrate that a curriculum found with Bayesian optimization can outperform a vanilla deep RL agent and a hand-engineered curriculum in the domain of autonomous racing with obstacle avoidance.

    "abstract": "Deep learning models have been widely used during the last decade due to their outstanding learning and abstraction capacities. However, one of the main challenges any scientist has to face using deep learning models is to establish the network's architecture. Due to this difficulty, data scientists usually build over complex models and, as a result, most of them result computationally intensive and impose a large memory footprint, generating huge costs, contributing to climate change and hindering their use in computational-limited devices. In this paper, we propose a novel feed-forward neural network constructing method based on pruning and transfer learning. Its performance has been thoroughly assessed in classification and regression problems. Without any accuracy loss, our approach can compress the number of parameters by more than 70%. Even further, choosing the pruning parameter carefully, most of the refined models outperform original ones. We also evaluate the transfer learning level comparing the refined model and the original one training from scratch a neural network with the same hyper parameters as the optimized model. The results obtained show that our constructing method not only helps in the design of more efficient models but also more effective ones. ",

Unlike traditional neural networks, GNNs are capable of capturing complex relationships and dependencies inherent in graph data, making them particularly suited for a wide range of applications including social network analysis, molecular chemistry, and network security. The impact of GNNs in these domains is profound, enabling more accurate models and predictions, and thereby contributing significantly to advancements in these fields. GNNs, with their unique structure and operation, present new computational challenges compared to conventional neural networks. This requires comprehensive benchmarking and a thorough characterization of GNNs to obtain insight into their computational requirements and to identify potential performance bottlenecks. In this thesis, we aim to develop a better understanding of how GNNs interact with the underlying hardware and will leverage this knowledge as we design specialized accelerators and develop new optimizations, leading to more efficient and faster GNN computations. Synthesizing these insights and optimizations, we design a state-of-the-art hardware accelerator capable of efficiently handling various GNN workloads. Our accelerator architecture is built on our characterization of GNN computational demands, providing clear motivation for our approach. Furthermore, we extend our exploration to emerging GNN workloads in the domain of graph neural networks.

We propose the adversarial counterfactual regression network (ACFR) that adversarially minimizes the representation imbalance in terms of KL divergence, and also maintains the impact of the treatment value on the outcome prediction by leveraging an attention mechanism.

To address this, there are many defense solutions but they suffer from unrealistic assumptions and generalization issues, making them less practical for reliable protection. Driven by these limitations, we introduce a novel defense mechanism, SAME, based on the concept of sample reconstruction. This strategy imposes minimal prerequisites on the defender's capabilities, eliminating the need for auxiliary Out-of-Distribution (OOD) datasets, user query history, white-box model access, and additional intervention during model training.

The MDER aims to identify the emotional information contained in different modalities, e.g., text, video, and audio, in different dialogue scenes. However, existing research has focused on modeling contextual semantic information and dialogue relations between speakers while ignoring the impact of event relations on emotion. To tackle the above issues, we propose a novel Dialogue and Event Relation-Aware Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Multimodal Emotion Recognition (DER-GCN) method. It models dialogue relations between speakers and captures latent event relations information. Specifically, we construct a weighted multi-relationship graph to simultaneously capture the dependencies between speakers and event relations in a dialogue. Moreover, we also introduce a Self-Supervised Masked Graph Autoencoder (SMGAE) to improve the fusion representation ability of features and structures. Next, we design a new Multiple Information Transformer (MIT) to capture the correlation between different relations, which can provide a better fuse of the multivariate information between relations. Finally, we propose a loss optimization strategy based on contrastive learning to enhance the representation learning ability of minority class features. We conduct extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and MELD benchmark datasets, which verify the effectiveness of the DER-GCN model. The results demonstrate that our model significantly improves both the average accuracy and the f1 value of emotion recognition. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been deployed for many image segmentation tasks and achieved outstanding performance. However, preparing a dataset for training segmentation DNNs is laborious and costly since typically pixel-level annotations are provided for each object of interest. To alleviate this issue, one can provide only weak labels such as bounding boxes or scribbles, or less accurate (noisy) annotations of the objects. These are significantly faster to generate and thus result in more annotated images given the same time budget. However, the reduction in quality might negatively affect the segmentation performance of the resulting model. In this study, we perform a thorough cost-effectiveness evaluation of several weak and noisy labels. We considered 11 variants of annotation strategies and 4 datasets. We conclude that the common practice of accurately outlining the objects of interest is virtually never the optimal approach when the annotation time is limited, even if notable annotation time is available (10s of hours). Annotation approaches that stood out in such scenarios were (1) polygon-based annotation with few vertices, and (2) box annotations combined with the Segment Anything Model (SAM). In situations where unlimited annotation time was available, precise annotations still lead to the highest segmentation model performance. ",

Initially, we revisit the properties of the Fourier transform on the 2D image, and verify the feasibility of multi-exposure image fusion on the frequency domain where the amplitude and phase component is able to guide the integration of the illumination information. Subsequently, we present the deep Fourier-based multi-exposure image fusion framework, which consists of a spatial path and frequency path for local and global modeling separately. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial-Frequency Fusion Block to facilitate efficient interaction between dual domains and capture complementary information from input images with different exposures. Finally, we combine a dual domain loss function to ensure the retention of complementary information in both the spatial and frequency domains.

    "abstract": "3D single object tracking remains a challenging problem due to the sparsity and incompleteness of the point clouds. Existing algorithms attempt to address the challenges in two strategies. The first strategy is to learn dense geometric features based on the captured sparse point cloud. Nevertheless, it is quite a formidable task since the learned dense geometric features are with high uncertainty for depicting the shape of the target object. The other strategy is to aggregate the sparse geometric features of multiple templates to enrich the shape information, which is a routine solution in 2D tracking. However, aggregating the coarse shape representations can hardly yield a precise shape representation. Different from 2D pixels, 3D points of different frames can be directly fused by coordinate transform, i.e., shape completion. Considering that, we propose to construct a synthetic target representation composed of dense and complete point clouds depicting the target shape precisely by shape completion for robust 3D tracking. Specifically, we design a voxelized 3D tracking framework with shape completion, in which we propose a quality-aware shape completion mechanism to alleviate the adverse effect of noisy historical predictions. It enables us to effectively construct and leverage the synthetic target representation. Besides, we also develop a voxelized relation modeling module and box refinement module to improve tracking performance. Favorable performance against state-of-the-art algorithms on three benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method. ",

We treat each KG as a client that trains a local language model through textbased knowledge representation learning. A central server then aggregates the model weights from clients. As natural language provides a universal representation, the same knowledge thus has similar semantic representations across KGs. As such, the aggregated language model can leverage complementary knowledge from multilingual KGs without demanding raw user data sharing.

    "abstract": "Backdoor attacks are emerging threats to deep neural networks, which typically embed malicious behaviors into a victim model by injecting poisoned samples. Adversaries can activate the injected backdoor during inference by presenting the trigger on input images. Prior defensive methods have achieved remarkable success in countering dirty-label backdoor attacks where the labels of poisoned samples are often mislabeled. However, these approaches do not work for a recent new type of backdoor -- clean-label backdoor attacks that imperceptibly modify poisoned data and hold consistent labels. More complex and powerful algorithms are demanded to defend against such stealthy attacks. In this paper, we propose UltraClean, a general framework that simplifies the identification of poisoned samples and defends against both dirty-label and clean-label backdoor attacks. Given the fact that backdoor triggers introduce adversarial noise that intensifies in feed-forward propagation, UltraClean first generates two variants of training samples using off-the-shelf denoising functions. It then measures the susceptibility of training samples leveraging the error amplification effect in DNNs, which dilates the noise difference between the original image and denoised variants. Lastly, it filters out poisoned samples based on the susceptibility to thwart the backdoor implantation. Despite its simplicity, UltraClean achieves a superior detection rate across various datasets and significantly reduces the backdoor attack success rate while maintaining a decent model accuracy on clean data, outperforming existing defensive methods by a large margin.

    "abstract": "Intent classification is a fundamental task in natural language understanding, aiming to categorize user queries or sentences into predefined classes to understand user intent. The most challenging aspect of this particular task lies in effectively incorporating all possible classes of intent into a dataset while ensuring adequate linguistic variation. Plenty of research has been conducted in the related domains in rich-resource languages like English. In this study, we introduce BNIntent30, a comprehensive Bengali intent classification dataset containing 30 intent classes. The dataset is excerpted and translated from the CLINIC150 dataset containing a diverse range of user intents categorized over 150 classes. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach for Bengali intent classification using Generative Adversarial BERT to evaluate the proposed dataset, which we call GAN-BnBERT. Our approach leverages the power of BERT-based contextual embeddings to capture salient linguistic features and contextual information from the text data, while the generative adversarial network (GAN) component complements the model's ability to learn diverse representations of existing intent classes through generative modeling. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GAN-BnBERT model achieves superior performance on the newly introduced BNIntent30 dataset, surpassing the existing Bi-LSTM and the stand-alone BERT-based classification model.

    "abstract": "Existing out-of-distribution (OOD) methods have shown great success on balanced datasets but become ineffective in long-tailed recognition (LTR) scenarios where 1) OOD samples are often wrongly classified into head classes and/or 2) tail-class samples are treated as OOD samples. To address these issues, current studies fit a prior distribution of auxiliary/pseudo OOD data to the long-tailed in-distribution (ID) data. However, it is difficult to obtain such an accurate prior distribution given the unknowingness of real OOD samples and heavy class imbalance in LTR. A straightforward solution to avoid the requirement of this prior is to learn an outlier class to encapsulate the OOD samples. The main challenge is then to tackle the aforementioned confusion between OOD samples and head/tail-class samples when learning the outlier class. To this end, we introduce a novel calibrated outlier class learning (COCL) approach, in which 1) a debiased large margin learning method is introduced in the outlier class learning to distinguish OOD samples from both head and tail classes in the representation space and 2) an outlier-class-aware logit calibration method is defined to enhance the long-tailed classification confidence. Extensive empirical results on three popular benchmarks CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that COCL substantially outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods in LTR while being able to improve the classification accuracy on ID data.

    "abstract": "Non-contrastive self-supervised learning (NC-SSL) methods like BarlowTwins and VICReg have shown great promise for label-free representation learning in computer vision. Despite the apparent simplicity of these techniques, researchers must rely on several empirical heuristics to achieve competitive performance, most notably using high-dimensional projector heads and two augmentations of the same image. In this work, we provide theoretical insights on the implicit bias of the BarlowTwins and VICReg loss that can explain these heuristics and guide the development of more principled recommendations. Our first insight is that the orthogonality of the features is more critical than projector dimensionality for learning good representations. Based on this, we empirically demonstrate that low-dimensional projector heads are sufficient with appropriate regularization, contrary to the existing heuristic. Our second theoretical insight suggests that using multiple data augmentations better represents the desiderata of the SSL objective. Based on this, we demonstrate that leveraging more augmentations per sample improves representation quality and trainability. In particular, it improves optimization convergence, leading to better features emerging earlier in the training. Remarkably, we demonstrate that we can reduce the pretraining dataset size by up to 4x while maintaining accuracy and improving convergence simply by using more data augmentations. Combining these insights, we present practical pretraining recommendations that improve wall-clock time by 2x and improve performance on CIFAR-10/STL-10 datasets using a ResNet-50 backbone. Thus, this work provides a theoretical insight into NC-SSL and produces practical recommendations for enhancing its sample and compute efficiency. ",

Vibration-based Deep Learning (DL) methodologies have become the de facto standard for bearing fault detection as they can produce state-of-the-art detection performances under certain conditions. Despite such particular focus on the vibration signal, the utilization of sound, on the other hand, has been neglected whilst only a few studies have been proposed during the last two decades, all of which were based on a conventional ML approach. One major reason is the lack of a benchmark dataset providing a large volume of both vibration and sound data over several working conditions for different machines and sensor locations. In this study, we address this need by presenting the new benchmark Qatar University Dual-Machine Bearing Fault Benchmark dataset (QU-DMBF), which encapsulates sound and vibration data from two different motors operating under 1080 working conditions overall. Then we draw the focus on the major limitations and drawbacks of vibration-based fault detection due to numerous installation and operational conditions. Finally, we propose the first DL approach for sound-based fault detection and perform comparative evaluations between the sound and vibration over the QU-DMBF dataset. A wide range of experimental results shows that the sound-based fault detection method is significantly more robust than its vibration-based counterpart, as it is entirely independent of the sensor location, cost-effective (requiring no sensor and sensor maintenance), and can achieve the same level of the best detection performance by its vibration-based counterpart. With this study, the QU-DMBF dataset, the optimized source codes in PyTorch, and comparative evaluations are now publicly shared. ",

    "abstract": "Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in online recommendation platforms as it involves estimating the probability of user engagement with advertisements or items by clicking on them. Given the availability of various services like online shopping, ride-sharing, food delivery, and professional services on commercial platforms, recommendation systems in these platforms are required to make CTR predictions across multiple domains rather than just a single domain. However, multi-domain click-through rate (MDCTR) prediction remains a challenging task in online recommendation due to the complex mutual influence between domains. Traditional MDCTR models typically encode domains as discrete identifiers, ignoring rich semantic information underlying. Consequently, they can hardly generalize to new domains. Besides, existing models can be easily dominated by some specific domains, which results in significant performance drops in the other domains (\\ie the ``seesaw phenomenon``). In this paper, we propose a novel solution Uni-CTR to address the above challenges. Uni-CTR leverages a backbone Large Language Model (LLM) to learn layer-wise semantic representations that capture commonalities between domains. Uni-CTR also uses several domain-specific networks to capture the characteristics of each domain. Note that we design a masked loss strategy so that these domain-specific networks are decoupled from backbone LLM. This allows domain-specific networks to remain unchanged when incorporating new or removing domains, thereby enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the system significantly. Experimental results on three public datasets show that Uni-CTR outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) MDCTR models significantly. Furthermore, Uni-CTR demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in zero-shot prediction. We have applied Uni-CTR in industrial scenarios, confirming its efficiency. ",

However, the absence of label information, coupled with the inherently high-dimensional nature, improves the difficulty for the interpretation of learned representations. Consequently, indirect evaluations become the popular metric for evaluating the quality of these features, leading to a biased validation of the learned representation rationale. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel approach termed Concept-based Explainable Image Representation (CEIR). Initially, using the Concept-based Model (CBM) incorporated with pretrained CLIP and concepts generated by GPT-4, we project input images into a concept vector space. Subsequently, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) learns the latent representation from these projected concepts, which serves as the final image representation. Due to the capability of the representation to encapsulate high-level, semantically relevant concepts, the model allows for attributions to a human-comprehensible concept space. This not only enhances interpretability but also preserves the robustness essential for downstream tasks. For instance, our method exhibits state-of-the-art unsupervised clustering performance on benchmarks such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and STL10. Furthermore, capitalizing on the universality of human conceptual understanding, CEIR can seamlessly extract the related concept from open-world images without fine-tuning. This offers a fresh approach to automatic label generation and label manipulation. ",

To obtain such features, existing works utilize high-resolution input images or fine-grained image tokens. However, this dense high-resolution representation brings a significant computational burden. In this paper, we address the following question: \"Only sparse human keypoint locations are detected for human pose estimation, is it really necessary to describe the whole image in a dense, high-resolution manner?\" Based on dynamic transformer models, we propose a framework that only uses Sparse High-resolution Representations for human Pose estimation (SHaRPose). In detail, SHaRPose consists of two stages. At the coarse stage, the relations between image regions and keypoints are dynamically mined while a coarse estimation is generated. Then, a quality predictor is applied to decide whether the coarse estimation results should be refined. At the fine stage, SHaRPose builds sparse high-resolution representations only on the regions related to the keypoints and provides refined high-precision human pose estimations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of the proposed method. Specifically, compared to the state-of-the-art method ViTPose, our model SHaRPose-Base achieves 77.4 AP (+0.5 AP) on the COCO validation set and 76.7 AP (+0.5 AP) on the COCO test-dev set, and infers at a speed of $1.4\\times$ faster than ViTPose-Base.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models and Multi-Modal LLMs have become pervasive, and so does the importance of their security; yet, modern LLMs are known to be vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks. These attacks can allow malicious users to exploit the models, making the case for effective jailbreak detection mechanisms an essential aspect of maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of LLM-based applications. However, existing detection works on jailbreak attacks have limitations. Existing post-query-based strategies require target domain knowledge, and pre-query-based methods mainly focus on text-level attacks and fail to meet the increasingly complex multi-modal security requirements placed upon contemporary LLMs. This gap underscores the need for a more comprehensive approach to safeguarding these influential systems. In this work, we propose JailGuard, the first mutation-based jailbreaking detection framework which supports both image and text modalities. Our key observation is that attack queries inherently possess less robustness compared to benign queries. Specifically, to confuse the model, attack queries are usually crafted with well-designed templates or complicate perturbations, leading to a fact that a slight disturbance in input may result in a drastic change in the response. This lack of robustness can be utilized in attack detection. Based on this intuition, we designed and implemented a detection framework comprising 19 different mutators and a divergence-based detection formula. To fully understand the effectiveness of our framework, we built the first multi-modal LLM jailbreaking attack dataset, which has 304 items of data, covering ten types of known jailbreaking attacks on image and text modalities. The evaluation suggests that JailGuard achieves the best detection accuracy of 89.38%/85.42% on image and text inputs, outperforming state-of-the-art defense methods by 15.28%. ",

On the other hand, Orchard (OSDI 2020) provides good accuracy and the rigorous guarantee of differential privacy over an untrusted server, but creates huge overhead for the devices. This paper describes Aero, a new federated learning system that significantly improves this trade-off. Aero guarantees good accuracy, differential privacy over an untrusted server, and keeps the device overhead low. The key idea of Aero is to tune system architecture and design to a specific set of popular, federated learning algorithms. This tuning requires novel optimizations and techniques, e.g., a new protocol to securely aggregate updates from devices. An evaluation of Aero demonstrates that it provides comparable accuracy to plain federated learning (without differential privacy), and it improves efficiency (CPU and network) over Orchard by up to $10^5\\times$.

In order to address this issue, in this paper we propose a novel generic framework to learn the representation of spatial networks that are embedded in non-Euclidean manifold space. Specifically, a novel message-passing-based neural network is proposed to combine graph topology and spatial geometry, where spatial geometry is extracted as messages on the edges. We theoretically guarantee that the learned representations are provably invariant to important symmetries such as rotation or translation, and simultaneously maintain sufficient ability in distinguishing different geometric structures.

One key challenge in leveraging such data is generating meaningful insights into effective teacher practices. Quantitative ethnography bears the potential to close this gap by combining multimodal data streams into networks of co-occurring behavior that drive insight into favorable learning conditions. The present study uses transmodal ordered network analysis to understand effective teacher practices in relationship to traditional metrics of in-system learning in a mathematics classroom working with AI tutors. Incorporating teacher practices captured by position tracking and human observation codes into modeling significantly improved the inference of how efficiently students improved in the AI tutor beyond a model with tutor log data features only. Comparing teacher practices by student learning rates, we find that students with low learning rates exhibited more hint use after monitoring. However, after an extended visit, students with low learning rates showed learning behavior similar to their high learning rate peers, achieving repeated correct attempts in the tutor. Observation notes suggest conceptual and procedural support differences can help explain visit effectiveness. Taken together, offering early conceptual support to students with low learning rates could make classroom practice with AI tutors more effective. This study advances the scientific understanding of effective teacher practice in classrooms learning with AI tutors and methodologies to make such practices visible. ",

The network comprises multiple source-destination pairs, where each source sends a sequence of status update packets to its destination over a shared spectrum. The TSA protocol stipulates that a source node must remain silent until its AoI reaches a predefined threshold, after which the node accesses the radio channel with a certain probability. Using stochastic geometry tools, we derive analytical expressions for the transmission success probability, mean peak AoI, and time-average AoI. Subsequently, we obtain closed-form expressions for the optimal update rate and age threshold that minimize the mean peak and time-average AoI, respectively. In addition, we establish a scaling law for the mean peak AoI and time-average AoI in mobile networks, revealing that the optimal mean peak AoI and time-average AoI increase linearly with the deployment density. Notably, the growth rate of time-average AoI under TSA is half of that under conventional slotted ALOHA. When considering the optimal mean peak AoI, the TSA protocol exhibits comparable performance to the traditional slotted ALOHA protocol. These findings conclusively affirm the advantage of TSA in reducing higher-order AoI, particularly in densely deployed networks. ",

    "abstract": "Machine learning-assisted retrosynthesis prediction models have been gaining widespread adoption, though their performances oftentimes degrade significantly when deployed in real-world applications embracing out-of-distribution (OOD) molecules or reactions. Despite steady progress on standard benchmarks, our understanding of existing retrosynthesis prediction models under the premise of distribution shifts remains stagnant. To this end, we first formally sort out two types of distribution shifts in retrosynthesis prediction and construct two groups of benchmark datasets. Next, through comprehensive experiments, we systematically compare state-of-the-art retrosynthesis prediction models on the two groups of benchmarks, revealing the limitations of previous in-distribution evaluation and re-examining the advantages of each model. More remarkably, we are motivated by the above empirical insights to propose two model-agnostic techniques that can improve the OOD generalization of arbitrary off-the-shelf retrosynthesis prediction algorithms. Our preliminary experiments show their high potential with an average performance improvement of 4.6%, and the established benchmarks serve as a foothold for further retrosynthesis prediction research towards OOD generalization.

    "abstract": "Node representation learning by using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has been widely explored. However, in recent years, compelling evidence has revealed that GNN-based node representation learning can be substantially deteriorated by delicately-crafted perturbations in a graph structure. To learn robust node representation in the presence of perturbations, various works have been proposed to safeguard GNNs. Within these existing works, Bayesian label transition has been proven to be more effective, but this method is extensively reliant on a well-built prior distribution. The variational inference could address this limitation by sampling the latent node embedding from a Gaussian prior distribution. Besides, leveraging the Gaussian distribution (noise) in hidden layers is an appealing strategy to strengthen the robustness of GNNs. However, our experiments indicate that such a strategy can cause over-smoothing issues during node aggregation. In this work, we propose the Graph Variational Diffusion Network (GVDN), a new node encoder that effectively manipulates Gaussian noise to safeguard robustness on perturbed graphs while alleviating over-smoothing issues through two mechanisms: Gaussian diffusion and node embedding propagation. Thanks to these two mechanisms, our model can generate robust node embeddings for recovery. Specifically, we design a retraining mechanism using the generated node embedding to recover the performance of node classifications in the presence of perturbations. The experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed model across six public datasets. ",

    "abstract": "Robustness is widely regarded as a fundamental problem in the analysis of machine learning (ML) models. Most often robustness equates with deciding the non-existence of adversarial examples, where adversarial examples denote situations where small changes on some inputs cause a change in the prediction. The perceived importance of ML model robustness explains the continued progress observed for most of the last decade. Whereas robustness is often assessed locally, i.e. given some target point in feature space, robustness can also be defined globally, i.e. where any point in feature space can be considered. The importance of ML model robustness is illustrated for example by the existence of competitions evaluating the progress of robustness tools, namely in the case of neural networks (NNs) but also by efforts towards robustness certification. More recently, robustness tools have also been used for computing rigorous explanations of ML models. In contrast with the observed successes of robustness, this paper uncovers some limitations with existing definitions of robustness, both global and local, but also with efforts towards robustness certification. The paper also investigates uses of adversarial examples besides those related with robustness. ",

    "abstract": "Traditional machine learning is generally treated as a black-box optimization problem and does not typically produce interpretable functions that connect inputs and outputs. However, the ability to discover such interpretable functions is desirable. In this work, we propose GINN-LP, an interpretable neural network to discover the form and coefficients of the underlying equation of a dataset, when the equation is assumed to take the form of a multivariate Laurent Polynomial. This is facilitated by a new type of interpretable neural network block, named the \"power-term approximator block\", consisting of logarithmic and exponential activation functions. GINN-LP is end-to-end differentiable, making it possible to use backpropagation for training. We propose a neural network growth strategy that will enable finding the suitable number of terms in the Laurent polynomial that represents the data, along with sparsity regularization to promote the discovery of concise equations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that can discover arbitrary multivariate Laurent polynomial terms without any prior information on the order. Our approach is first evaluated on a subset of data used in SRBench, a benchmark for symbolic regression. We first show that GINN-LP outperforms the state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods on datasets generated using 48 real-world equations in the form of multivariate Laurent polynomials. Next, we propose an ensemble method that combines our method with a high-performing symbolic regression method, enabling us to discover non-Laurent polynomial equations. We achieve state-of-the-art results in equation discovery, showing an absolute improvement of 7.1% over the best contender, by applying this ensemble method to 113 datasets within SRBench with known ground-truth equations.

Recent NeRF-based approaches have shown superiority in quality and fidelity compared to previous studies. However, when it comes to few-shot talking head generation, a practical scenario where only few seconds of talking video is available for one identity, two limitations emerge: 1) they either have no base model, which serves as a facial prior for fast convergence, or ignore the importance of audio when building the prior; 2) most of them overlook the degree of correlation between different face regions and audio, e.g., mouth is audio related, while ear is audio independent. In this paper, we present Audio Enhanced Neural Radiance Field (AE-NeRF) to tackle the above issues, which can generate realistic portraits of a new speaker with fewshot dataset. Specifically, we introduce an Audio Aware Aggregation module into the feature fusion stage of the reference scheme, where the weight is determined by the similarity of audio between reference and target image. Then, an Audio-Aligned Face Generation strategy is proposed to model the audio related and audio independent regions respectively, with a dual-NeRF framework. Extensive experiments have shown AE-NeRF surpasses the state-of-the-art on image fidelity, audio-lip synchronization, and generalization ability, even in limited training set or training iterations.

Until now, the shape detection of the deformable objects has faced several challenges: 1) unable to form a unified framework for multiple shapes; 2) the calculation burden as a large number of calculations; 3) the inability to solve the 3D point-cloud case. A novel shape detection framework for deformable objects is presented in this paper, which only uses the input 2D-pixel data of the objects without any artificial markers. The proposed detection approach runs in a highly real-time manner. For the definitions of the shapes of the deformable objects, three shape configurations are used to describe the outlines of the objects, i.e., centerline, contour, and surface. In addition, for the obtaining of the 3D shape, Different from the traditional 3D point cloud processing method, this article uses a one-to-one mapping method between 2D-pixel points and 3D shape points. Therefore, this guarantees a one-to-one correspondence between 2D and 3D shape points. Hence, the proposed approach can enhance the autonomous capability to detect the shape of deformable objects. Detailed experimental results are conducted within the centerline configuration to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed shape detection framework. ",

Iterative gradient or model exchanges between devices and the centralized server in the standard FL paradigm suffer from severe efficiency bottlenecks on the server. While enabling collaborative training without a central server, existing decentralized FL approaches either focus on the synchronous mechanism that deteriorates FL convergence or ignore device staleness with an asynchronous mechanism, resulting in inferior FL accuracy. In this paper, we propose an Asynchronous Efficient Decentralized FL framework, i.e., AEDFL, in heterogeneous environments with three unique contributions. First, we propose an asynchronous FL system model with an efficient model aggregation method for improving the FL convergence. Second, we propose a dynamic staleness-aware model update approach to achieve superior accuracy. Third, we propose an adaptive sparse training method to reduce communication and computation costs without significant accuracy degradation. Extensive experimentation on four public datasets and four models demonstrates the strength of AEDFL in terms of accuracy (up to 16.3% higher), efficiency (up to 92.9% faster), and computation costs (up to 42.3% lower).

    "abstract": "Recent research demonstrates that GNNs are vulnerable to the model stealing attack, a nefarious endeavor geared towards duplicating the target model via query permissions. However, they mainly focus on node classification tasks, neglecting the potential threats entailed within the domain of graph classification tasks. Furthermore, their practicality is questionable due to unreasonable assumptions, specifically concerning the large data requirements and extensive model knowledge. To this end, we advocate following strict settings with limited real data and hard-label awareness to generate synthetic data, thereby facilitating the stealing of the target model. Specifically, following important data generation principles, we introduce three model stealing attacks to adapt to different actual scenarios: MSA-AU is inspired by active learning and emphasizes the uncertainty to enhance query value of generated samples; MSA-AD introduces diversity based on Mixup augmentation strategy to alleviate the query inefficiency issue caused by over-similar samples generated by MSA-AU; MSA-AUD combines the above two strategies to seamlessly integrate the authenticity, uncertainty, and diversity of the generated samples. Finally, extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods in terms of concealment, query efficiency, and stealing performance. ",

Due to the limited conversation context and background knowledge, existing CRSs rely on external sources such as knowledge graphs to enrich the context and model entities based on their inter-relations. However, these methods ignore the rich intrinsic information within entities. To address this, we introduce the Knowledge-Enhanced Entity Representation Learning (KERL) framework, which leverages both the knowledge graph and a pre-trained language model to improve the semantic understanding of entities for CRS. In our KERL framework, entity textual descriptions are encoded via a pre-trained language model, while a knowledge graph helps reinforce the representation of these entities. We also employ positional encoding to effectively capture the temporal information of entities in a conversation. The enhanced entity representation is then used to develop a recommender component that fuses both entity and contextual representations for more informed recommendations, as well as a dialogue component that generates informative entity-related information in the response text. A high-quality knowledge graph with aligned entity descriptions is constructed to facilitate our study, namely the Wiki Movie Knowledge Graph (WikiMKG). The experimental results show that KERL achieves state-of-the-art results in both recommendation and response generation tasks. ",

Contemporary LiDAR-based 3D detectors perform poorly on rare classes (e.g., CenterPoint only achieves 5.1 AP on stroller) as it is difficult to recognize objects from sparse LiDAR points alone. RGB images provide visual evidence to help resolve such ambiguities, motivating the study of RGB-LiDAR fusion. In this paper, we delve into a simple late-fusion framework that ensembles independently trained RGB and LiDAR detectors. Unlike recent end-to-end methods which require paired multi-modal training data, our late-fusion approach can easily leverage large-scale uni-modal datasets, significantly improving rare class detection.In particular, we examine three critical components in this late-fusion framework from first principles, including whether to train 2D or 3D RGB detectors, whether to match RGB and LiDAR detections in 3D or the projected 2D image plane, and how to fuse matched detections.Extensive experiments reveal that 2D RGB detectors achieve better recognition accuracy than 3D RGB detectors, matching on the 2D image plane mitigates depth estimation errors, and fusing scores probabilistically with calibration leads to state-of-the-art LT3D performance.

Graph invariant learning methods, backed by the invariance principle among defined multiple environments, have shown effectiveness in dealing with this issue. However, existing methods heavily rely on well-predefined or accurately generated environment partitions, which are hard to be obtained in practice, leading to sub-optimal OOD generalization performances. In this paper, we propose a novel graph invariant learning method based on invariant and variant patterns co-mixup strategy, which is capable of jointly generating mixed multiple environments and capturing invariant patterns from the mixed graph data. Specifically, we first adopt a subgraph extractor to identify invariant subgraphs. Subsequently, we design one novel co-mixup strategy, i.e., jointly conducting environment Mixup and invariant Mixup. For the environment Mixup, we mix the variant environment-related subgraphs so as to generate sufficiently diverse multiple environments, which is important to guarantee the quality of the graph invariant learning. For the invariant Mixup, we mix the invariant subgraphs, further encouraging to capture invariant patterns behind graphs while getting rid of spurious correlations for OOD generalization. We demonstrate that the proposed environment Mixup and invariant Mixup can mutually promote each other. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art under various distribution shifts. ",

Thirdly, a distributed localization protocol is proposed such that all the agents can cooperatively find their positions by solving the complex constraints in dynamic networks. Fourthly, the proposed method is extended to address the problem of integrated distributed localization and formation control. It is worth mentioning that the proposed algorithm can also be applied in the case that only distance and sign of direction measurements are available, where the sign of direction measurement is a kind of one bit local relative measurement and has less information than local bearing.

    "abstract": "In mineral processing plants, grinding is a crucial step, accounting for approximately 50 percent of the total mineral processing costs. Semi-autogenous grinding mills are extensively employed in the grinding circuit of mineral processing plants. Maximizing SAG mill throughput is of significant importance considering its profound financial outcomes. However, the optimum process parameter setting aimed at achieving maximum mill throughput remains an uninvestigated domain in prior research. This study introduces a hybrid intelligent framework leveraging expert knowledge, machine learning techniques, and evolutionary algorithms to address this research need. In this study, we utilize an extensive industrial dataset comprising 36743 records and select relevant features based on the insights of industry experts. Following the removal of erroneous data, a comprehensive evaluation of 17 diverse machine learning models is undertaken to identify the most accurate predictive model. To improve the model performance, feature selection and outlier detection are executed. The resultant optimal model, trained with refined features, serves as the objective function within three distinct evolutionary algorithms. These algorithms are employed to identify parameter configurations that maximize SAG mill throughput while adhering to the working limits of input parameters as constraints. Notably, our analysis revealed that CatBoost, as an ensemble model, stands out as the most accurate predictor. Furthermore, differential evolution emerges as the preferred optimization algorithm, exhibiting superior performance in both achieving the highest mill throughput predictions and ensuring robustness in predictions, surpassing alternative methods.

Much research has been dedicated to improving deblurring performance through model architectural designs. However, there is little work on data augmentation for image deblurring. Since continuous motion causes blurred artifacts during image exposure, we aspire to develop a groundbreaking blur augmentation method to generate diverse blurred images by simulating motion trajectories in a continuous space. This paper proposes Implicit Diffusion-based reBLurring AUgmentation (ID-Blau), utilizing a sharp image paired with a controllable blur condition map to produce a corresponding blurred image. We parameterize the blur patterns of a blurred image with their orientations and magnitudes as a pixel-wise blur condition map to simulate motion trajectories and implicitly represent them in a continuous space. By sampling diverse blur conditions, ID-Blau can generate various blurred images unseen in the training set. Experimental results demonstrate that ID-Blau can produce realistic blurred images for training and thus significantly improve performance for state-of-the-art deblurring models. ",

In this paper, we introduce a novel, versatile framework for causal discovery that accommodates the presence of causally-related hidden variables almost everywhere in the causal network (for instance, they can be effects of observed variables), based on rank information of covariance matrix over observed variables. We start by investigating the efficacy of rank in comparison to conditional independence and, theoretically, establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the identifiability of certain latent structural patterns. Furthermore, we develop a Rank-based Latent Causal Discovery algorithm, RLCD, that can efficiently locate hidden variables, determine their cardinalities, and discover the entire causal structure over both measured and hidden ones. We also show that, under certain graphical conditions, RLCD correctly identifies the Markov Equivalence Class of the whole latent causal graph asymptotically. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world personality data sets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in finite-sample cases. ",

To address this cost-efficiently, optimized utilization of EONs is required. Next-generation bandwidth-variable transceivers (BVTs) will offer increased adaptivity in symbol rate as well as modulation through probabilistic constellation shaping. In this work, we therefore investigate the impact of increased configuration granularity on various aspects of optical networks. We account for practical implementation considerations of BVT configurations for the estimation of the required signal-to-noise ratio. Additionally, an optimization algorithm is presented that selects the most efficient configuration for each considered data rate and bandwidth combination. Based on the advanced transceiver configurations, we conduct a network planning study using a physical-layer-aware algorithm for flexible-grid EONs, and present results for a national and a continental optical backbone network topology. Our research demonstrates that a rise in modulation rate adaptivity results in substantial savings in resources, decreasing the number of necessary lightpaths by as much as 20% in EONs. In contrast, increased symbol rate granularity only results in minor savings. ",

    "abstract": "Visual detection of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) has received increasing research attention in recent years due to its importance in many applications. However, the existing approaches based on either appearance or motion features of MAVs still face challenges when the background is complex, the MAV target is small, or the computation resource is limited. In this paper, we propose a global-local MAV detector that can fuse both motion and appearance features for MAV detection under challenging conditions. This detector first searches MAV target using a global detector and then switches to a local detector which works in an adaptive search region to enhance accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, a detector switcher is applied to coordinate the global and local detectors. A new dataset is created to train and verify the effectiveness of the proposed detector. This dataset contains more challenging scenarios that can occur in practice. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets show that the proposed detector outperforms the state-of-the-art ones in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency. In particular, this detector can run with near real-time frame rate on NVIDIA Jetson NX Xavier, which demonstrates the usefulness of our approach for real-world applications.

The decomposed feature design enables customizing modules to cater for different scenarios with individual specialty and yielding desired results at lower cost. Based on T-Code, we propose our highly compact hybrid neural graphics primitives (HybridNGP) for multi-camera setting and deformation neural graphics primitives with T-Code (DNGP-T) for monocular scenario.

To address this gap, we develop a unified model for bundle recommendation, termed hypergraph-enhanced dual convolutional neural network (HED). Our approach is characterized by two key aspects.

Existing multimodal rumor detection has focused on mixing tokens among spatial and sequential locations for unimodal representation or fusing clues of rumor veracity across modalities. However, they suffer from less discriminative unimodal representation and are vulnerable to intricate location dependencies in the time-consuming fusion of spatial and sequential tokens. This work makes the first attempt at multimodal rumor detection in the frequency domain, which efficiently transforms spatial features into the frequency spectrum and obtains highly discriminative spectrum features for multimodal representation and fusion. A novel Frequency Spectrum Representation and fUsion network (FSRU) with dual contrastive learning reveals the frequency spectrum is more effective for multimodal representation and fusion, extracting the informative components for rumor detection. FSRU involves three novel mechanisms: utilizing the Fourier transform to convert features in the spatial domain to the frequency domain, the unimodal spectrum compression, and the cross-modal spectrum co-selection module in the frequency domain. Substantial experiments show that FSRU achieves satisfactory multimodal rumor detection performance. ",

However, replicating this process remains a challenge for AI agents and naturally raises two questions: How to extract discriminative knowledge representation from priors? How to develop a rational plan to decompose complex problems? Most existing representation learning methods employing a single encoder structure are fragile and sensitive to complex and diverse dynamics. To address this issue, we introduce a multiple-encoder and individual-predictor regime to learn task-essential representations from sufficient data for simple subtasks. Multiple encoders can extract adequate task-relevant dynamics without confusion, and the shared predictor can discriminate the task characteristics. We also use the attention mechanism to generate a top-k subtask planning tree, which customizes subtask execution plans in guiding complex decisions on unseen tasks. This process enables forward-looking and globality by flexibly adjusting the depth and width of the planning tree. Empirical results on a challenging platform composed of some basic simple tasks and combinatorially rich synthetic tasks consistently outperform some competitive baselines and demonstrate the benefits of our design.

    "abstract": "Ensuring driving safety for autonomous vehicles has become increasingly crucial, highlighting the need for systematic tracking of pedestrians on the road. Most vehicles are equipped with visual sensors, however, the large-scale visual dataset from different agents has not been well studied yet. Basically, most of the multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) tracking systems are composed of two modules: single camera tracking (SCT) and inter-camera tracking (ICT). To reliably coordinate between them, MTMC tracking has been a very complicated task, while tracking across multi-moving cameras makes it even more challenging. In this paper, we focus on multi-target multi-moving camera (MTMMC) tracking, which is attracting increasing attention from the research community. Observing there are few datasets for MTMMC tracking, we collect a new dataset, called Multi-Moving Camera Track (MMCT), which contains sequences under various driving scenarios. To address the common problems of identity switch easily faced by most existing SCT trackers, especially for moving cameras due to ego-motion between the camera and targets, a lightweight appearance-free global link model, called Linker, is proposed to mitigate the identity switch by associating two disjoint tracklets of the same target into a complete trajectory within the same camera. Incorporated with Linker, existing SCT trackers generally obtain a significant improvement. Moreover, a strong baseline approach of re-identification (Re-ID) is effectively incorporated to extract robust appearance features under varying surroundings for pedestrian association across moving cameras for ICT, resulting in a much improved MTMMC tracking system, which can constitute a step further towards coordinated mining of multiple moving cameras.

Despite achieving high performance, they often overfit to the table style in training set, and suffer from significant performance degradation when encountering out-of-distribution tables in other domains. To tackle this problem, we start from the essence of the table, which is a set of text arranged in rows and columns. Based on this, we propose a novel, light-weighted and robust Table Detection method based on Learning Text Arrangement, namely TDeLTA. TDeLTA takes the text blocks as input, and then models the arrangement of them with a sequential encoder and an attention module. To locate the tables precisely, we design a text-classification task, classifying the text blocks into 4 categories according to their semantic roles in the tables. Experiments are conducted on both the text blocks parsed from PDF and extracted by open-source OCR tools, respectively. Compared to several state-of-the-art methods, TDeLTA achieves competitive results with only 3.1M model parameters on the large-scale public datasets. Moreover, when faced with the cross-domain data under the 0-shot setting, TDeLTA outperforms baselines by a large margin of nearly 7%, which shows the strong robustness and transferability of the proposed model.

    "abstract": "Point cloud-based 3D object tracking is an important task in autonomous driving. Though great advances regarding Siamese-based 3D tracking have been made recently, it remains challenging to learn the correlation between the template and search branches effectively with the sparse LIDAR point cloud data. Instead of performing correlation of the two branches at just one point in the network, in this paper, we present a multi-correlation Siamese Transformer network that has multiple stages and carries out feature correlation at the end of each stage based on sparse pillars. More specifically, in each stage, self-attention is first applied to each branch separately to capture the non-local context information. Then, cross-attention is used to inject the template information into the search area. This strategy allows the feature learning of the search area to be aware of the template while keeping the individual characteristics of the template intact. To enable the network to easily preserve the information learned at different stages and ease the optimization, for the search area, we densely connect the initial input sparse pillars and the output of each stage to all subsequent stages and the target localization network, which converts pillars to bird's eye view (BEV) feature maps and predicts the state of the target with a small densely connected convolution network. Deep supervision is added to each stage to further boost the performance as well. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on the popular KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo datasets, and the experimental results show that our method achieves promising performance compared with the state-of-the-art.

Unlike previous studies, PaTeCon uses graph patterns and statistical information relevant to the given KG to automatically generate temporal constraints, without the need for human experts. In this paper, we illustrate how this method can be optimized to achieve significant speed improvement. We also annotate Wikidata and Freebase to build two new benchmarks for conflict detection.

Then, we identify anomalous samples in terms of the presence of label transition of the intermediary images, detect the target label by quantifying distribution discrepancy, select their purified images considering pixel and feature distance, and determine their ground-truth labels by training a benign model.

Many existing mining methods deal with the task of change points detection, but very few provide a flexible approach. Querying specific change points with linguistic variables is particularly useful in crime analysis, where intuitive, understandable, and appropriate detection of changes can significantly improve the allocation of resources for timely and concise operations. In this paper, we propose an on-line method for detecting and querying change points in crime-related time series with the use of a meaningful representation and a fuzzy inference system. Change points detection is based on a shape space representation, and linguistic terms describing geometric properties of the change points are used to express queries, offering the advantage of intuitiveness and flexibility. An empirical evaluation is first conducted on a crime data set to confirm the validity of the proposed method and then on a financial data set to test its general applicability. A comparison to a similar change-point detection algorithm and a sensitivity analysis are also conducted. Results show that the method is able to accurately detect change points at very low computational costs. More broadly, the detection of specific change points within time series of virtually any domain is made more intuitive and more understandable, even for experts not related to data mining. ",

On the other hand, neighborhood sampling techniques become essential to manage large graph sizes, yet finding the optimal trade-off between speed and accuracy with sampling techniques remains challenging. This work advances representation learning on single large-scale graphs with a focus on identifying model characteristics and critical design constraints for developing scalable graph transformer (GT) architectures. We argue such GT requires layers that can adeptly learn both local and global graph representations while swiftly sampling the graph topology. As such, a key innovation of this work lies in the creation of a fast neighborhood sampling technique coupled with a local attention mechanism that encompasses a 4-hop reception field, but achieved through just 2-hop operations. This local node embedding is then integrated with a global node embedding, acquired via another self-attention layer with an approximate global codebook, before finally sent through a downstream layer for node predictions. The proposed GT framework, named LargeGT, overcomes previous computational bottlenecks and is validated on three large-scale node classification benchmarks. We report a 3x speedup and 16.8% performance gain on ogbn-products and snap-patents, while we also scale LargeGT on ogbn-papers100M with a 5.9% performance improvement. ",

    "abstract": "Metcalfe's Law captures the relationship between a network's value, and its scale, asserting that a network's value is directly proportional to the square of its size. Over the past four decades, various researchers have put forth different derivative scaling laws on this matter. Remarkably, these seemingly conflicting conclusions have all been substantiated by robust data validation, raising the question of which law holds greater representativeness. Therefore, there remains a need for a comprehensive and resilient theoretical model to underpin these patterns. This study aims to bridge this disparity by offering a theoretical interpretation of Metcalfe's Law and its variations. Building upon a certain degree of consensus that, \\textit{traffic is value}, we gauge network effects by means of network traffic load. To deduce a general analytical boundary for network traffic load, we strike a balance between practicality and analytical feasibility by establishing a comprehensive network model. Building upon this foundation, we provide potential theoretical interpretations for Metcalfe's Law and its variants, achieving alignment between our theoretical derivations and the previously validated empirical evidence for Metcalfe's Law.

There is, however, a crucial limitation in most existing approaches: their high computational costs. These costs limit the deployment of models, the size of the training dataset, and the number of research groups that can afford research with large self-supervised models. Likewise, we should consider the environmental costs that high energy consumption implies. Efforts in this direction comprise optimization of existing models, neural architecture efficiency, improvements in finetuning for speech processing tasks, and data efficiency.

Recent studies tend to address this task with a table-filling paradigm, wherein word relations are encoded in a two-dimensional table, and the process involves clarifying all the individual cells to extract triples. However, these studies ignore the deep interaction between neighbor cells, which we find quite helpful for accurate extraction. To this end, we propose a novel model for the ASTE task, called Prompt-based Tri-Channel Graph Convolution Neural Network (PT-GCN), which converts the relation table into a graph to explore more comprehensive relational information. Specifically, we treat the original table cells as nodes and utilize a prompt attention score computation module to determine the edges' weights. This enables us to construct a target-aware grid-like graph to enhance the overall extraction process. After that, a triple-channel convolution module is conducted to extract precise sentiment knowledge.

    "abstract": "Natural scene text detection is a significant challenge in computer vision, with tremendous potential applications in multilingual, diverse, and complex text scenarios. We propose a multilingual text detection model to address the issues of low accuracy and high difficulty in detecting multilingual text in natural scenes. In response to the challenges posed by multilingual text images with multiple character sets and various font styles, we introduce the SFM Swin Transformer feature extraction network to enhance the model's robustness in detecting characters and fonts across different languages. Dealing with the considerable variation in text scales and complex arrangements in natural scene text images, we present the AS-HRFPN feature fusion network by incorporating an Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion module and a Spatial Pyramid Pooling module. The feature fusion network improvements enhance the model's ability to detect text sizes and orientations. Addressing diverse backgrounds and font variations in multilingual scene text images is a challenge for existing methods. Limited local receptive fields hinder detection performance. To overcome this, we propose a Global Semantic Segmentation Branch, extracting and preserving global features for more effective text detection, aligning with the need for comprehensive information. In this study, we collected and built a real-world multilingual natural scene text image dataset and conducted comprehensive experiments and analyses. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves an F-measure of 85.02\\%, which is 4.71\\% higher than the baseline model.

The estimated passenger positions can be used for various automation tasks such as measurement of passenger behavior during boarding. The paper describes a novel wireless localization system, based on Artificial Neural Networks, which passively senses the location of passengers. The position estimation is based on the observation of wireless communication signals that are already present in the environment. In this context, \"passive\" means that no additional devices are needed for the passengers. Experimental results show that the proposed system is able to achieve an average accuracy of 12 cm in a challenging environment like an aircraft cabin.

In NOs, a central characteristic is to learn the governing physical laws directly from data. In contrast to other machine learning applications, partial knowledge is often known a priori about the physical system at hand whereby quantities such as mass, energy and momentum are exactly conserved. Currently, NOs have to learn these conservation laws from data and can only approximately satisfy them due to finite training data and random noise. In this work, we introduce conservation law-encoded neural operators (clawNOs), a suite of NOs that endow inference with automatic satisfaction of such conservation laws. ClawNOs are built with a divergence-free prediction of the solution field, with which the continuity equation is automatically guaranteed. As a consequence, clawNOs are compliant with the most fundamental and ubiquitous conservation laws essential for correct physical consistency. As demonstrations, we consider a wide variety of scientific applications ranging from constitutive modeling of material deformation, incompressible fluid dynamics, to atmospheric simulation. ClawNOs significantly outperform the state-of-the-art NOs in learning efficacy, especially in small-data regimes. ",

Unlike previous work relying on an orchestrator with an always-updated global view of the available resources and the users' locations, this work envisions a distributed solution to the above problems. In particular, we propose a distributed asynchronous framework for service deployment in the edge-cloud that increases the system resilience by avoiding a single point of failure, as in the case of a central orchestrator. Our solution ensures cost-efficient feasible placement of services, while using negligible bandwidth. Our results, obtained through trace-driven, large-scale simulations, show that the proposed solution provides performance very close to those obtained by state-of-the-art centralized solutions, and at the cost of a small communication overhead.

We propose an attribution framework, FAKEPCD, to attribute (fake) point clouds to their respective generative models (or real-world collections). The main idea of FAKEPCD is to train an attribution model that learns the point cloud features from different sources and further differentiates these sources using an attribution signal. Depending on the characteristics of the training point clouds, namely, sources and shapes, we formulate four attribution scenarios: close-world, open-world, single-shape, and multiple-shape, and evaluate FAKEPCD's performance in each scenario. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FAKEPCD on source attribution across different scenarios. Take the open-world attribution as an example, FAKEPCD attributes point clouds to known sources with an accuracy of 0.82-0.98 and to unknown sources with an accuracy of 0.73-1.00. Additionally, we introduce an approach to visualize unique patterns (fingerprints) in point clouds associated with each source. This explains how FAKEPCD recognizes point clouds from various sources by focusing on distinct areas within them. Overall, we hope our study establishes a baseline for the source attribution of (fake) point clouds. ",

We begin with the observation that the training can be highly unstable for DE-GAIL at the beginning of the training phase and end up divergence. Conversely, the ST-GAIL training trajectory remains consistent, reliably converging. To shed light on these disparities, we provide an explanation from a theoretical perspective. By establishing a probabilistic lower bound for GAIL, we demonstrate that gradient explosion is an inevitable outcome for DE-GAIL due to occasionally large expert-imitator policy disparity, whereas ST-GAIL does not have the issue with it. To substantiate our assertion, we illustrate how modifications in the reward function can mitigate the gradient explosion challenge. Finally, we propose CREDO, a simple yet effective strategy that clips the reward function during the training phase, allowing the GAIL to enjoy high data efficiency and stable trainability. ",

Traditional traffic monitoring mainly focuses on the local anomalous status of events due to a large amount of data. BGP-based event monitoring makes it possible to perform differential analysis of international events.

Motivated by this observation, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection model, MAD-MulW, which incorporates a multi-window serial framework. Firstly, we design the W-GAT module to adaptively update the sample weights within the window and retain the updated information of the trailing sample, which not only reduces the outlier samples' noise but also avoids the space consumption of data scale expansion. Then, the W-LAT module based on predictive reconstruction both captures the trend of sample fluctuations over a certain period of time and increases the interclass variation through the reconstruction of the predictive sample. Our model has been experimentally validated on multiple BGP anomalous events with an average F1 score of over 90\\%, which demonstrates the significant improvement effect of the stage windows and adaptive strategy on the efficiency and stability of the timing model.

    "abstract": "Legal case retrieval is an information retrieval task in the legal domain, which aims to retrieve relevant cases with a given query case. Recent research of legal case retrieval mainly relies on traditional bag-of-words models and language models. Although these methods have achieved significant improvement in retrieval accuracy, there are still two challenges: (1) Legal structural information neglect. Previous neural legal case retrieval models mostly encode the unstructured raw text of case into a case representation, which causes the lack of important legal structural information in a case and leads to poor case representation; (2) Lengthy legal text limitation. When using the powerful BERT-based models, there is a limit of input text lengths, which inevitably requires to shorten the input via truncation or division with a loss of legal context information. In this paper, a graph neural networks-based legal case retrieval model, CaseGNN, is developed to tackle these challenges. To effectively utilise the legal structural information during encoding, a case is firstly converted into a Text-Attributed Case Graph (TACG), followed by a designed Edge Graph Attention Layer and a readout function to obtain the case graph representation. The CaseGNN model is optimised with a carefully designed contrastive loss with easy and hard negative sampling. Since the text attributes in the case graph come from individual sentences, the restriction of using language models is further avoided without losing the legal context. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two benchmarks from COLIEE 2022 and COLIEE 2023, which demonstrate that CaseGNN outperforms other state-of-the-art legal case retrieval methods.

Experience underscores the significant advantages of intra-layer feature interaction in enhancing target detection tasks.

This oversight results in increased false detections and missed targets.To address this critical issue, this paper introduces the Global Feature Pyramid Network (GFPNet), an augmented version of PAFPN that integrates global information for enhanced target detection. Specifically, we leverage a lightweight MLP to capture global feature information, utilize the VNC encoder to process these features, and employ a parallel learnable mechanism to extract intra-layer features from the input image. Building on this foundation, we retain the PAFPN method to facilitate inter-layer feature interaction, extracting rich feature details across various levels.Compared to conventional feature pyramids, GFPN not only effectively focuses on inter-layer feature information but also captures global feature details, fostering intra-layer feature interaction and generating a more comprehensive and impactful feature representation.

    "abstract": "Robust Optimal Control (ROC) with adjustable uncertainties has proven to be effective in addressing critical challenges within modern energy networks, especially the reserve and provision problem. However, prior research on ROC with adjustable uncertainties has predominantly focused on the scenario of uncertainties modeled as continuous variables. In this paper, we explore ROC with binary adjustable uncertainties, where the uncertainties are modeled by binary decision variables, marking the first investigation of its kind. To tackle this new challenge, firstly we introduce a metric designed to quantitatively measure the extent of binary adjustable uncertainties. Then, to balance computational tractability and adaptability, we restrict control policies to be affine functions with respect to uncertainties, and propose a general design framework for ROC with binary adjustable uncertainties. To address the inherent computational demands of the original ROC problem, especially in large-scale applications, we employ strong duality (SD) and big-M-based reformulations to create a scalable and computationally efficient Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation. Numerical simulations are conducted to showcase the performance of our proposed approach, demonstrating its applicability and effectiveness in handling binary adjustable uncertainties within the context of modern energy networks.

    "abstract": "Coarse-to-fine 3D instance segmentation methods show weak performances compared to recent Grouping-based, Kernel-based and Transformer-based methods. We argue that this is due to two limitations: 1) Instance size overestimation by axis-aligned bounding box(AABB) 2) False negative error accumulation from inaccurate box to the refinement phase. In this work, we introduce Spherical Mask, a novel coarse-to-fine approach based on spherical representation, overcoming those two limitations with several benefits. Specifically, our coarse detection estimates each instance with a 3D polygon using a center and radial distance predictions, which avoids excessive size estimation of AABB. To cut the error propagation in the existing coarse-to-fine approaches, we virtually migrate points based on the polygon, allowing all foreground points, including false negatives, to be refined. During inference, the proposal and point migration modules run in parallel and are assembled to form binary masks of instances. We also introduce two margin-based losses for the point migration to enforce corrections for the false positives/negatives and cohesion of foreground points, significantly improving the performance. Experimental results from three datasets, such as ScanNetV2, S3DIS, and STPLS3D, show that our proposed method outperforms existing works, demonstrating the effectiveness of the new instance representation with spherical coordinates.

However, the absence of Knowledge Graph (KG) environment awareness and the challenge of engineering viable optimization mechanisms for intermediary reasoning processes, constrict the performance of LLMs on KG reasoning tasks compared to smaller models. We introduce LLM-ARK, a LLM grounded KG reasoning agent designed to deliver precise and adaptable predictions on KG paths. LLM-ARK utilizes Full Textual Environment (FTE) prompts to assimilate state information for each step-sized intelligence. Leveraging LLMs to richly encode and represent various types of inputs and integrate the knowledge graph further with path environment data, before making the final decision. Reframing the Knowledge Graph (KG) multi-hop inference problem as a sequential decision-making issue, we optimize our model using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) online policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm which allows the model to learn from a vast array of reward signals across diverse tasks and environments. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLM(GPT-4) and our method which using open-source models of varying sizes on OpenDialKG dataset. Our experiment shows that LLaMA7B-ARK provides excellent results with a performance rate of 48.75% for the target@1 evaluation metric, far exceeding the current state-of-the-art model by 17.64 percentage points.

It might be used for a variety of applications, including image annotation and searching for missing children, etc. The largest challenge to kinship verification in practice is the fact that parent and child photos frequently differ significantly from one another. How to effectively respond to such a challenge is important improving the efficiency of kinship verification. For this purpose, we introduce a system to check relatedness that starts with a pair of face images of a child and a parent, after which it is revealed whether two people are related or not. The first step in our approach is face preprocessing with two methods, a Retinex filter and an ellipse mask, then a feature extraction step based on hist-Gabor wavelets, which is used before an efficient dimensionality reduction method called TXQDA. Finally, determine if there is a relationship. By using Cornell KinFace benchmark database, we ran a number of tests to show the efficacy of our strategy.

As exploration in the scope of generalized NLP is much more advanced, it implies the tremendous gap that is still to be addressed amongst all feasible tasks where an opinion, taste, or feelings are inherent, thus creating a need for a solution, where a data fusion could take place. We have chosen the task of funniness, as it heavily relies on the sense of humor, which is fundamentally subjective. Our experiments across five personalized and four generalized datasets involving several personalized deep neural architectures have shown that the task of humor detection greatly benefits from the inclusion of personalized data in the training process. We tested five scenarios of training data fusion that focused on either generalized (majority voting) or personalized approaches to humor detection. The best results were obtained for the setup, in which all available personalized datasets were joined to train the personalized reasoning model. It boosted the prediction performance by up to approximately 35% of the macro F1 score. Such a significant gain was observed for all five personalized test sets. At the same time, the impact of the model's architecture was much less than the personalization itself. It seems that concatenating personalized datasets, even with the cost of normalizing the range of annotations across all datasets, if combined with the personalized models, results in an enormous increase in the performance of humor detection.

Attacks leveraging certain data augmentation, such as random resizing, have been found to help AEs generalize from surrogates to targets. Yet, prior work has explored limited augmentations and their composition. To fill the gap, we systematically studied how data augmentation affects transferability. Particularly, we explored 46 augmentation techniques of seven categories originally proposed to help ML models generalize to unseen benign samples, and assessed how they impact transferability, when applied individually or composed. Performing exhaustive search on a small subset of augmentation techniques and genetic search on all techniques, we identified augmentation combinations that can help promote transferability. Extensive experiments with the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets and 18 models showed that simple color-space augmentations (e.g., color to greyscale) outperform the state of the art when combined with standard augmentations, such as translation and scaling. Additionally, we discovered that composing augmentations impacts transferability mostly monotonically (i.e., more methods composed $\\rightarrow$ $\\ge$ transferability). We also found that the best composition significantly outperformed the state of the art (e.g., 93.7% vs. $\\le$ 82.7% average transferability on ImageNet from normally trained surrogates to adversarially trained targets). Lastly, our theoretical analysis, backed up by empirical evidence, intuitively explain why certain augmentations help improve transferability. ",

We assume: i) Partial observability -- time series data is only available over a subset of the nodes; ii) Input noise -- it is correlated across distinct nodes while temporally independent, i.e., it is spatially colored. We present a feasibility condition on the noise correlation structure wherein there exists a consistent network inference estimator to recover the underlying fundamental dependencies among the observed nodes.

A range of topics, such as climate change, religion and vaccines has been subject to increasing politicization in the media and social media platforms. In this work, we propose a computational method for assessing politicization in online conversations based on topic shifts, i.e., the degree to which people switch topics in online conversations. The intuition is that topic shifts from a non-political topic to politics are a direct measure of politicization -- making something political, and that the more people switch conversations to politics, the more they perceive politics as playing a vital role in their daily lives. A fundamental challenge that must be addressed when one studies politicization in social media is that, a priori, any topic may be politicized. Hence, any keyword-based method or even machine learning approaches that rely on topic labels to classify topics are expensive to run and potentially ineffective. Instead, we learn from a seed of political keywords and use Positive-Unlabeled (PU) Learning to detect political comments in reaction to non-political news articles posted on Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok during the 2022 Brazilian presidential elections. Our findings indicate that all platforms show evidence of politicization as discussion around topics adjacent to politics such as economy, crime and drugs tend to shift to politics. Even the least politicized topics had the rate in which their topics shift to politics increased in the lead up to the elections and after other political events in Brazil -- an evidence of politicization.

Its detection is of great importance as it increases the risk of a Urinary Tract Infection, which can then lead to a kidney infection since bacteria may have direct access to the kidneys. Unfortunately the detection of VUR requires a rather painful medical examination, called voiding cysteourethrogram (VCUG), that exposes the child to radiation. In an effort to avoid the exposure to radiation required by VCUG some recent studies examined the use of machine learning techniques for the detection of VUR based on data that can be obtained without exposing the child to radiation. This work takes one step further by proposing an approach that provides lower and upper bounds for the conditional probability of a given child having VUR. The important property of these bounds is that they are guaranteed (up to statistical fluctuations) to contain well-calibrated probabilities with the only requirement that observations are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Therefore they are much more informative and reliable than the plain yes/no answers provided by other techniques. ",

Specifically, we propose Deep Convolutional Physically-Based Rendering (DC-PBR) parameterization, which re-parameterizes the physically-based rendering (PBR) texture maps with randomly initialized convolution-based neural kernels, instead of a standard pixel-based parameterization. We show that DC-PBR inherently schedules the optimization curriculum according to texture frequency and naturally filters out the noisy signals from SDS. In experiments, Paint-it obtains remarkable quality PBR texture maps within 15 min., given only a text description. We demonstrate the generalizability and practicality of Paint-it by synthesizing high-quality texture maps for large-scale mesh datasets and showing test-time applications such as relighting and material control using a popular graphics engine.

However, prior works lack a comprehensive evaluation of different language families, making it challenging to evaluate LLM robustness against errors in external retrieved knowledge. To overcome this, we establish NoMIRACL, a human-annotated dataset for evaluating LLM robustness in RAG across 18 typologically diverse languages. NoMIRACL includes both a non-relevant and a relevant subset. Queries in the non-relevant subset contain passages manually judged as non-relevant or noisy, whereas queries in the relevant subset include at least a single judged relevant passage. We measure LLM robustness using two metrics: (i) hallucination rate, measuring model tendency to hallucinate an answer, when the answer is not present in passages in the non-relevant subset, and (ii) error rate, measuring model inaccuracy to recognize relevant passages in the relevant subset. We build a GPT-4 baseline which achieves a 33.2% hallucination rate on the non-relevant and a 14.9% error rate on the relevant subset on average. Our evaluation reveals that GPT-4 hallucinates frequently in high-resource languages, such as French or English.

    "abstract": "Detecting objects accurately from a large or open vocabulary necessitates the vision-language alignment on region representations. However, learning such a region-text alignment by obtaining high-quality box annotations with text labels or descriptions is expensive and infeasible. In contrast, collecting image-text pairs is simpler but lacks precise object location information to associate regions with texts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Contrastive Language-Image Mosaic (CLIM), which leverages large-scale image-text pairs effectively for aligning region and text representations. CLIM combines multiple images into a mosaicked image and treats each image as a `pseudo region'. The feature of each pseudo region is extracted and trained to be similar to the corresponding text embedding while dissimilar from others by a contrastive loss, enabling the model to learn the region-text alignment without costly box annotations. As a generally applicable approach, CLIM consistently improves different open-vocabulary object detection methods that use caption supervision. Furthermore, CLIM can effectively enhance the region representation of vision-language models, thus providing stronger backbones for open-vocabulary object detectors. Our experimental results demonstrate that CLIM improves different baseline open-vocabulary object detectors by a large margin on both OV-COCO and OV-LVIS benchmarks.

Meanwhile, mask-free attention-based methods often exhibit editing leakage and misalignment in more complex compositions. In this work, we develop $\\textbf{MAG-Edit}$, a training-free, inference-stage optimization method, which enables localized image editing in complex scenarios. In particular, MAG-Edit optimizes the noise latent feature in diffusion models by maximizing two mask-based cross-attention constraints of the edit token, which in turn gradually enhances the local alignment with the desired prompt. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving both text alignment and structure preservation for localized editing within complex scenarios.

    "abstract": "The rise of AI-powered classification techniques has ushered in a new era for data-driven Fault Detection and Diagnosis in smart building systems. While extensive research has championed supervised FDD approaches, the real-world application of unsupervised methods remains limited. Among these, cluster analysis stands out for its potential with Building Management System data. This study introduces an unsupervised learning strategy to detect faults in terminal air handling units and their associated systems. The methodology involves pre-processing historical sensor data using Principal Component Analysis to streamline dimensions. This is then followed by OPTICS clustering, juxtaposed against k-means for comparison. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy was gauged using several labeled datasets depicting various fault scenarios and real-world building BMS data. Results showed that OPTICS consistently surpassed k-means in accuracy across seasons. Notably, OPTICS offers a unique visualization feature for users called reachability distance, allowing a preview of detected clusters before setting thresholds. Moreover, according to the results, while PCA is beneficial for reducing computational costs and enhancing noise reduction, thereby generally improving the clarity of cluster differentiation in reachability distance. It also has its limitations, particularly in complex fault scenarios. In such cases, PCA's dimensionality reduction may result in the loss of critical information, leading to some clusters being less discernible or entirely undetected. These overlooked clusters could be indicative of underlying faults, and their obscurity represents a significant limitation of PCA when identifying potential fault lines in intricate datasets. ",

Semi-supervised Machine Learning (ML) based anomaly detection approaches such as autoencoders and variational autoencoders are often used for such tasks. However, supervised ML techniques such as Siamese Neural Network (SNN) models can outperform unsupervised or semi-supervised approaches for anomaly detection by leveraging the label information. One of the challenges specific to anomaly detection for particle accelerators is the data's variability due to system configuration changes. To address this challenge, we employ Conditional Siamese Neural Network (CSNN) models and Conditional Variational Auto Encoder (CVAE) models to predict errant beam pulses at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) under different system configuration conditions and compare their performance.

It is a remote sensing technology that utilizes laser beams to measure distances and create detailed three-dimensional representations of objects and environments. The potential of Full Waveform LiDAR is much greater than just height estimation and 3D reconstruction only. Overall shape of signal provides important information about properties of water body. However, the shape of FWL is unexplored as most LiDAR software work on point cloud by utilizing the maximum value within the waveform. Existing techniques in the field of LiDAR data analysis include depth estimation through inverse modeling and regression of logarithmic intensity and depth for approximating the attenuation coefficient. However, these methods suffer from limitations in accuracy. Depth estimation through inverse modeling provides only approximate values and does not account for variations in surface properties, while the regression approach for the attenuation coefficient is only able to generalize a value through several data points which lacks precision and may lead to significant errors in estimation. Additionally, there is currently no established modeling method available for predicting bottom reflectance. This research proposed a novel solution based on neural networks for parameter estimation in LIDAR data analysis. By leveraging the power of neural networks, the proposed solution successfully learned the inversion model, was able to do prediction of parameters such as depth, attenuation coefficient, and bottom reflectance. Performance of model was validated by testing it on real LiDAR data. In future, more data availability would enable more accuracy and reliability of such models. ",

    "abstract": "In streaming settings, speech recognition models have to map sub-sequences of speech to text before the full audio stream becomes available. However, since alignment information between speech and text is rarely available during training, models need to learn it in a completely self-supervised way. In practice, the exponential number of possible alignments makes this extremely challenging, with models often learning peaky or sub-optimal alignments. Prima facie, the exponential nature of the alignment space makes it difficult to even quantify the uncertainty of a model's alignment distribution. Fortunately, it has been known for decades that the entropy of a probabilistic finite state transducer can be computed in time linear to the size of the transducer via a dynamic programming reduction based on semirings. In this work, we revisit the entropy semiring for neural speech recognition models, and show how alignment entropy can be used to supervise models through regularization or distillation. We also contribute an open-source implementation of CTC and RNN-T in the semiring framework that includes numerically stable and highly parallel variants of the entropy semiring. Empirically, we observe that the addition of alignment distillation improves the accuracy and latency of an already well-optimized teacher-student distillation model, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Librispeech dataset in the streaming scenario.

Multi-modal models need to be robust: missing video frames should not degrade the performance of an audiovisual model to be worse than that of a single-modality audio-only model. While there have been many attempts at building robust models, there is little consensus on how robustness should be evaluated. To address this, we introduce a framework that allows claims about robustness to be evaluated in a precise and testable way. We also conduct a systematic empirical study of the robustness of common audiovisual speech recognition architectures on a range of acoustic noise conditions and test suites. Finally, we show that an architecture-agnostic solution based on cascades can consistently achieve robustness to missing video, even in settings where existing techniques for robustness like dropout fall short.

One solution to this problem is assuming that cause and effect are generated from a structural causal model, enabling identification of the causal direction after estimating the model in each direction. The heteroscedastic noise model is a type of structural causal model where the cause can contribute to both the mean and variance of the noise. Current methods for estimating heteroscedastic noise models choose the Gaussian likelihood as the optimization objective which can be suboptimal and unstable when the data has a non-Gaussian distribution. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach to estimating this model with Student's $t$-distribution, which is known for its robustness in accounting for sampling variability with smaller sample sizes and extreme values without significantly altering the overall distribution shape. This adaptability is beneficial for capturing the parameters of the noise distribution in heteroscedastic noise models. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that our estimators are more robust and achieve better overall performance across synthetic and real benchmarks. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing devices can now perform sampling tasks which, according to complexity-theoretic and numerical evidence, are beyond the reach of classical computers. This raises the question of how one can efficiently verify that a quantum computer operating in this regime works as intended. In 2008, Shepherd and Bremner proposed a protocol in which a verifier constructs a unitary from the comparatively easy-to-implement family of so-called IQP circuits, and challenges a prover to execute it on a quantum computer. The challenge problem is designed to contain an obfuscated secret, which can be turned into a statistical test that accepts samples from a correct quantum implementation. It was conjectured that extracting the secret from the challenge problem is NP-hard, so that the ability to pass the test constitutes strong evidence that the prover possesses a quantum device and that it works as claimed. Unfortunately, about a decade later, Kahanamoku-Meyer found an efficient classical secret extraction attack. Bremner, Cheng, and Ji very recently followed up by constructing a wide-ranging generalization of the original protocol. Their IQP Stabilizer Scheme has been explicitly designed to circumvent the known weakness. They also suggested that the original construction can be made secure by adjusting the problem parameters. In this work, we develop a number of secret extraction attacks which are effective against both new approaches in a wide range of problem parameters. The important problem of finding an efficient and reliable verification protocol for sampling-based proofs of quantum supremacy thus remains open. ",

It plays a crucial role in identifying cardiac conditions and detecting anomalies in ECG data. However, distinguishing between normal and abnormal ECG signals can be a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an approach that leverages anomaly detection to identify unhealthy conditions using solely normal ECG data for training. Furthermore, to enhance the information available and build a robust system, we suggest considering both the time series and time-frequency domain aspects of the ECG signal. As a result, we introduce a specialized network called the Multimodal Time and Spectrogram Restoration Network (TSRNet) designed specifically for detecting anomalies in ECG signals. TSRNet falls into the category of restoration-based anomaly detection and draws inspiration from both the time series and spectrogram domains. By extracting representations from both domains, TSRNet effectively captures the comprehensive characteristics of the ECG signal. This approach enables the network to learn robust representations with superior discrimination abilities, allowing it to distinguish between normal and abnormal ECG patterns more effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a novel inference method, termed Peak-based Error, that specifically focuses on ECG peaks, a critical component in detecting abnormalities. The experimental result on the large-scale dataset PTB-XL has demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in ECG anomaly detection, while also prioritizing efficiency by minimizing the number of trainable parameters.

For example, a network trained for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on one scanner performs worse on another scanner. In this work, we investigate the impact of the training data on the model's performance and robustness for accelerated MRI. We find that models trained on the combination of various data distributions, such as those obtained from different MRI scanners and anatomies, exhibit robustness equal or superior to models trained on the best single distribution for a specific target distribution. Thus training on diverse data tends to improve robustness. Furthermore, training on diverse data does not compromise in-distribution performance, i.e., a model trained on diverse data yields in-distribution performance at least as good as models trained on the more narrow individual distributions. Our results suggest that training a model for imaging on a variety of distributions tends to yield a more effective and robust model than maintaining separate models for individual distributions. ",

To understand the causal impact of credit lines on spending, previous studies have employed causal estimators, based on direct regression (DR), inverse propensity weighting (IPW), and double machine learning (DML) to estimate the treatment effect. However, these estimators do not consider the notion that an individual's spending can be understood and represented as a distribution, which captures the range and pattern of amounts spent across different orders. By disregarding the outcome as a distribution, valuable insights embedded within the outcome distribution might be overlooked. This paper develops a distribution-valued estimator framework that extends existing real-valued DR-, IPW-, and DML-based estimators to distribution-valued estimators within Rubin's causal framework. We establish their consistency and apply them to a real dataset from a large e-commerce platform. Our findings reveal that credit lines positively influence spending across all quantiles; however, as credit lines increase, consumers allocate more to luxuries (higher quantiles) than necessities (lower quantiles).

First, we can analytically compute the posterior distribution of a treatment effect without relying on the computationally demanding posterior approximation. Second, we can guarantee that the posterior distribution concentrates around the true one as the sample size goes to infinity. Third, we can incorporate prior knowledge about a treatment effect into the prior distribution, improving the estimation efficiency.

    "abstract": "Segmentation is an important task in a wide range of computer vision applications, including medical image analysis. Recent years have seen an increase in the complexity of medical image segmentation approaches based on sophisticated convolutional neural network architectures. This progress has led to incremental enhancements in performance on widely recognised benchmark datasets. However, most of the existing approaches are computationally demanding, which limits their practical applicability. This paper presents an expand-squeeze dual multiscale residual network (ESDMR-Net), which is a fully convolutional network that is particularly well-suited for resource-constrained computing hardware such as mobile devices. ESDMR-Net focuses on extracting multiscale features, enabling the learning of contextual dependencies among semantically distinct features. The ESDMR-Net architecture allows dual-stream information flow within encoder-decoder pairs. The expansion operation (depthwise separable convolution) makes all of the rich features with multiscale information available to the squeeze operation (bottleneck layer), which then extracts the necessary information for the segmentation task. The Expand-Squeeze (ES) block helps the network pay more attention to under-represented classes, which contributes to improved segmentation accuracy. To enhance the flow of information across multiple resolutions or scales, we integrated dual multiscale residual (DMR) blocks into the skip connection. This integration enables the decoder to access features from various levels of abstraction, ultimately resulting in more comprehensive feature representations. We present experiments on seven datasets from five distinct examples of applications. Our model achieved the best results despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters, with a reduction of two or even three orders of magnitude. ",

    "abstract": "Stock price prediction is a complicated and interesting task. Noisy trends make stock pricing sensitive and complicated while the economical motivation behind, keeps it interesting for researchers and investors. In this paper we are to outline two novel ideas for stock pricing. We also test each of our suggested algorithms for predicting the price of 6 stocks from different sectors. To show the efficiency of our proposed algorithm, we compare the predicted prices with real values and also perform a backtest to verify that the annual returns based on real data and predicted price are almost the same.

    "title": "A Computationally Efficient Neural Video Compression Accelerator Based  on a Sparse CNN-Transformer Hybrid Network",
    "abstract": "Video compression is widely used in digital television, surveillance systems, and virtual reality. Real-time video decoding is crucial in practical scenarios. Recently, neural video compression (NVC) combines traditional coding with deep learning, achieving impressive compression efficiency. Nevertheless, the NVC models involve high computational costs and complex memory access patterns, challenging real-time hardware implementations. To relieve this burden, we propose an algorithm and hardware co-design framework named NVCA for video decoding on resource-limited devices. Firstly, a CNN-Transformer hybrid network is developed to improve compression performance by capturing multi-scale non-local features. In addition, we propose a fast algorithm-based sparse strategy that leverages the dual advantages of pruning and fast algorithms, sufficiently reducing computational complexity while maintaining video compression efficiency. Secondly, a reconfigurable sparse computing core is designed to flexibly support sparse convolutions and deconvolutions based on the fast algorithm-based sparse strategy. Furthermore, a novel heterogeneous layer chaining dataflow is incorporated to reduce off-chip memory traffic stemming from extensive inter-frame motion and residual information. Thirdly, the overall architecture of NVCA is designed and synthesized in TSMC 28nm CMOS technology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our design provides superior coding quality and up to 22.7x decoding speed improvements over other video compression designs. Meanwhile, our design achieves up to 2.2x improvements in energy efficiency compared to prior accelerators. ",

A caterpillar is a tree that will result in a path upon deletion of all the leaves. In this note, we prove that there exists a spanning caterpillar in any connected biconvex bipartite graph.

    "abstract": "Current deep learning algorithms designed for automatic ECG analysis have exhibited notable accuracy. However, akin to traditional electrocardiography, they tend to be narrowly focused and typically address a singular diagnostic condition. In this study, we specifically demonstrate the capability of a single model to predict a diverse range of both cardiac and non-cardiac discharge diagnoses based on a sole ECG collected in the emergency department. Among the 1,076 hierarchically structured ICD codes considered, our model achieves an AUROC exceeding 0.8 in 439 of them. This underscores the models proficiency in handling a wide array of diagnostic scenarios. We emphasize the potential of utilizing this model as a screening tool, potentially integrated into a holistic clinical decision support system for efficiently triaging patients in the emergency department. This research underscores the remarkable capabilities of comprehensive ECG analysis algorithms and the extensive range of possibilities facilitated by the open MIMIC-IV-ECG dataset. Finally, our data may play a pivotal role in revolutionizing the way ECG analysis is performed, marking a significant advancement in the field. ",

    "abstract": "Quantum computing revolutionizes the way of solving complex problems and handling vast datasets, which shows great potential to accelerate the machine learning process. However, data leakage in quantum machine learning (QML) may present privacy risks. Although differential privacy (DP), which protects privacy through the injection of artificial noise, is a well-established approach, its application in the QML domain remains under-explored. In this paper, we propose to harness inherent quantum noises to protect data privacy in QML. Especially, considering the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, we leverage the unavoidable shot noise and incoherent noise in quantum computing to preserve the privacy of QML models for binary classification. We mathematically analyze that the gradient of quantum circuit parameters in QML satisfies a Gaussian distribution, and derive the upper and lower bounds on its variance, which can potentially provide the DP guarantee. Through simulations, we show that a target privacy protection level can be achieved by running the quantum circuit a different number of times. ",

    "abstract": "In modern federated learning, one of the main challenges is to account for inherent heterogeneity and the diverse nature of data distributions for different clients. This problem is often addressed by introducing personalization of the models towards the data distribution of the particular client. However, a personalized model might be unreliable when applied to the data that is not typical for this client. Eventually, it may perform worse for these data than the non-personalized global model trained in a federated way on the data from all the clients. This paper presents a new approach to federated learning that allows selecting a model from global and personalized ones that would perform better for a particular input point. It is achieved through a careful modeling of predictive uncertainties that helps to detect local and global in- and out-of-distribution data and use this information to select the model that is confident in a prediction. The comprehensive experimental evaluation on the popular real-world image datasets shows the superior performance of the model in the presence of out-of-distribution data while performing on par with state-of-the-art personalized federated learning algorithms in the standard scenarios.

    "abstract": "Self-supervised methods have recently proved to be nearly as effective as supervised methods in various imaging inverse problems, paving the way for learning-based methods in scientific and medical imaging applications where ground truth data is hard or expensive to obtain. This is the case in magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. These methods critically rely on invariance to translations and/or rotations of the image distribution to learn from incomplete measurement data alone. However, existing approaches fail to obtain competitive performances in the problems of image super-resolution and deblurring, which play a key role in most imaging systems. In this work, we show that invariance to translations and rotations is insufficient to learn from measurements that only contain low-frequency information. Instead, we propose a new self-supervised approach that leverages the fact that many image distributions are approximately scale-invariant, and that can be applied to any inverse problem where high-frequency information is lost in the measurement process. We demonstrate throughout a series of experiments on real datasets that the proposed method outperforms other self-supervised approaches, and obtains performances on par with fully supervised learning.
