    "abstract": "Machine learning techniques are increasingly used for high-stakes decision-making, such as college admissions, loan attribution or recidivism prediction. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that the models learnt can be audited or understood by human users, do not create or reproduce discrimination or bias, and do not leak sensitive information regarding their training data. Indeed, interpretability, fairness and privacy are key requirements for the development of responsible machine learning, and all three have been studied extensively during the last decade. However, they were mainly considered in isolation, while in practice they interplay with each other, either positively or negatively. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we survey the literature on the interactions between these three desiderata. More precisely, for each pairwise interaction, we summarize the identified synergies and tensions. These findings highlight several fundamental theoretical and empirical conflicts, while also demonstrating that jointly considering these different requirements is challenging when one aims at preserving a high level of utility. To solve this issue, we also discuss possible conciliation mechanisms, showing that a careful design can enable to successfully handle these different concerns in practice. ",

    "abstract": "We propose INFAMOUS-NeRF, an implicit morphable face model that introduces hypernetworks to NeRF to improve the representation power in the presence of many training subjects. At the same time, INFAMOUS-NeRF resolves the classic hypernetwork tradeoff of representation power and editability by learning semantically-aligned latent spaces despite the subject-specific models, all without requiring a large pretrained model. INFAMOUS-NeRF further introduces a novel constraint to improve NeRF rendering along the face boundary. Our constraint can leverage photometric surface rendering and multi-view supervision to guide surface color prediction and improve rendering near the surface. Finally, we introduce a novel, loss-guided adaptive sampling method for more effective NeRF training by reducing the sampling redundancy. We show quantitatively and qualitatively that our method achieves higher representation power than prior face modeling methods in both controlled and in-the-wild settings. Code and models will be released upon publication. ",

    "abstract": "As 5G networks become more mainstream, privacy has come to the forefront of end users. More scrutiny has been shown to previous generation cellular technologies such as 3G and 4G on how they handle sensitive metadata transmitted from an end user mobile device to base stations during registration with a cellular network. These generation cellular networks do not enforce any encryption on this information transmitted during this process, giving malicious actors an easy way to intercept the information. Such an interception can allow an adversary to locate end users with shocking accuracy. This paper investigates this problem in great detail and discusses how a newly introduced approach in 5G networks is helping combat this problem. The paper discusses the implications of this vulnerability and the technical details of the new approach, including the encryption schemes used to secure this sensitive information. Finally, the paper will discuss any limitations to this new approach. ",

    "abstract": "Change detection, a prominent research area in remote sensing, is pivotal in observing and analyzing surface transformations. Despite significant advancements achieved through deep learning-based methods, executing high-precision change detection in spatio-temporally complex remote sensing scenarios still presents a substantial challenge. The recent emergence of foundation models, with their powerful universality and generalization capabilities, offers potential solutions. However, bridging the gap of data and tasks remains a significant obstacle. In this paper, we introduce Time Travelling Pixels (TTP), a novel approach that integrates the latent knowledge of the SAM foundation model into change detection. This method effectively addresses the domain shift in general knowledge transfer and the challenge of expressing homogeneous and heterogeneous characteristics of multi-temporal images.

    "abstract": "Recommender systems can be privacy-sensitive. To protect users' private historical interactions, federated learning has been proposed in distributed learning for user representations. Using federated recommender (FedRec) systems, users can train a shared recommendation model on local devices and prevent raw data transmissions and collections. However, the recommendation model learned by a common FedRec may still be vulnerable to private information leakage risks, particularly attribute inference attacks, which means that the attacker can easily infer users' personal attributes from the learned model. Additionally, traditional FedRecs seldom consider the diverse privacy preference of users, leading to difficulties in balancing the recommendation utility and privacy preservation. Consequently, FedRecs may suffer from unnecessary recommendation performance loss due to over-protection and private information leakage simultaneously. In this work, we propose a novel user-consented federated recommendation system (UC-FedRec) to flexibly satisfy the different privacy needs of users by paying a minimum recommendation accuracy price. UC-FedRec allows users to self-define their privacy preferences to meet various demands and makes recommendations with user consent. Experiments conducted on different real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework is more efficient and flexible compared to baselines. ",

While it can be convenient to algorithmically infer these models directly from observational data, the resulting networks are often plagued with erroneous edges. Auditing and correcting these networks may require domain expertise frequently unavailable to the analyst. We propose the use of large language models such as ChatGPT as an auditor for causal networks. Our method presents ChatGPT with a causal network, one edge at a time, to produce insights about edge directionality, possible confounders, and mediating variables. We ask ChatGPT to reflect on various aspects of each causal link and we then produce visualizations that summarize these viewpoints for the human analyst to direct the edge, gather more data, or test further hypotheses. We envision a system where large language models, automated causal inference, and the human analyst and domain expert work hand in hand as a team to derive holistic and comprehensive causal models for any given case scenario.

However, traditional 3D modeling techniques face unique challenges in the remote sensing context, including limited multi-view baselines over extensive regions, varying direct, ambient, and complex illumination conditions, and time-varying scene changes across captures. In this work, we introduce SUNDIAL, a comprehensive approach to 3D reconstruction of satellite imagery using neural radiance fields. We jointly learn satellite scene geometry, illumination components, and sun direction in this single-model approach, and propose a secondary shadow ray casting technique to 1) improve scene geometry using oblique sun angles to render shadows, 2) enable physically-based disentanglement of scene albedo and illumination, and 3) determine the components of illumination from direct, ambient (sky), and complex sources. To achieve this, we incorporate lighting cues and geometric priors from remote sensing literature in a neural rendering approach, modeling physical properties of satellite scenes such as shadows, scattered sky illumination, and complex illumination and shading of vegetation and water. We evaluate the performance of SUNDIAL against existing NeRF-based techniques for satellite scene modeling and demonstrate improved scene and lighting disentanglement, novel view and lighting rendering, and geometry and sun direction estimation on challenging scenes with small baselines, sparse inputs, and variable illumination.

It explores the various types of cognitive biases that may arise during forensic investigations and digital forensic analyses, such as confirmation bias, expectation bias, overconfidence in errors, contextual bias, and attributional biases. It also evaluates existing methods and techniques used to mitigate cognitive biases in these contexts, assessing the effectiveness of interventions aimed at reducing biases and improving decision-making outcomes. Additionally, this paper introduces a new cognitive bias, called \"impostor bias\", that may affect the use of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in forensics and digital forensics. The impostor bias is the tendency to doubt the authenticity or validity of the output generated by AI tools, such as deepfakes, in the form of audio, images, and videos. This bias may lead to erroneous judgments or false accusations, undermining the reliability and credibility of forensic evidence. The paper discusses the potential causes and consequences of the impostor bias, and suggests some strategies to prevent or counteract it. By addressing these topics, this paper seeks to offer valuable insights into understanding cognitive biases in forensic practices and provide recommendations for future research and practical applications to enhance the objectivity and validity of forensic investigations.

However, the quadratic complexity in self-attention computation has limited the applications, especially in low-resource settings and mobile or edge devices. Existing works have proposed to exploit hand-crafted attention patterns to reduce computation complexity. However, such hand-crafted patterns are data-agnostic and may not be optimal. Hence, it is likely that relevant keys or values are being reduced, while less important ones are still preserved. Based on this key insight, we propose a novel deformable audio Transformer for audio recognition, named DATAR, where a deformable attention equipping with a pyramid transformer backbone is constructed and learnable. Such an architecture has been proven effective in prediction tasks,~\\textit{e.g.}, event classification. Moreover, we identify that the deformable attention map computation may over-simplify the input feature, which can be further enhanced. Hence, we introduce a learnable input adaptor to alleviate this issue, and DATAR achieves state-of-the-art performance. ",

To handle these problems, we propose a novel Collaborative Enhancement Network called CENet, which performs the multilevel feature interactions in a parallel framework, for nighttime person ReID. In particular, CENet is a parallel Transformer network, in which the designed parallel structure can avoid the impact of the quality of relighting images on ReID performance. To perform effective collaborative modeling between image relighting and person ReID tasks, we integrate the multilevel feature interactions in CENet. Specifically, we share the Transformer encoder to build the low-level feature interaction, and then perform the feature distillation to transfer the high-level features from image relighting to ReID. In addition, the sizes of existing real-world nighttime person ReID datasets are small, and large-scale synthetic ones exhibit substantial domain gaps with real-world data. To leverage both small-scale real-world and large-scale synthetic training data, we develop a multi-domain learning algorithm, which alternately utilizes both kinds of data to reduce the inter-domain difference in the training of CENet. Extensive experiments on two real nighttime datasets, \\textit{Night600} and \\textit{RGBNT201$_{rgb}$}, and a synthetic nighttime ReID dataset are conducted to validate the effectiveness of CENet.

Our study focused on uncovering the causality of the spatial representations in LLMs. In particular, we discovered the potential spatial representations in DeBERTa, GPT-Neo using representational similarity analysis and linear and non-linear probing. Our casual intervention experiments showed that the spatial representations influenced the model's performance on next word prediction and a downstream task that relies on geospatial information. Our experiments suggested that the LLMs learn and use an internal model of space in solving geospatial related tasks. ",

However, previous depth adaptive networks do not provide general principles and a formal explanation on why and which layers can be skipped, and, hence, their approaches are hard to be generalized and require long and complex training steps. In this paper, we present an architectural pattern and training method for adaptive depth networks that can provide flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-offs in a single network. In our approach, every residual stage is divided into 2 consecutive sub-paths with different properties. While the first sub-path is mandatory for hierarchical feature learning, the other is optimized to incur minimal performance degradation even if it is skipped. Unlike previous adaptive networks, our approach does not iteratively self-distill a fixed set of sub-networks, resulting in significantly shorter training time. However, once deployed on devices, it can instantly construct sub-networks of varying depths to provide various accuracy-efficiency trade-offs in a single model. We provide a formal rationale for why the proposed architectural pattern and training method can reduce overall prediction errors while minimizing the impact of skipping selected sub-paths. We also demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our approach with various residual networks, both from convolutional neural networks and vision transformers. ",

    "abstract": "The multimodal recommendation has gradually become the infrastructure of online media platforms, enabling them to provide personalized service to users through a joint modeling of user historical behaviors (e.g., purchases, clicks) and item various modalities (e.g., visual and textual). The majority of existing studies typically focus on utilizing modal features or modal-related graph structure to learn user local interests. Nevertheless, these approaches encounter two limitations: (1) Shared updates of user ID embeddings result in the consequential coupling between collaboration and multimodal signals; (2) Lack of exploration into robust global user interests to alleviate the sparse interaction problems faced by local interest modeling. To address these issues, we propose a novel Local and Global Graph Learning-guided Multimodal Recommender (LGMRec), which jointly models local and global user interests. Specifically, we present a local graph embedding module to independently learn collaborative-related and modality-related embeddings of users and items with local topological relations. Moreover, a global hypergraph embedding module is designed to capture global user and item embeddings by modeling insightful global dependency relations. The global embeddings acquired within the hypergraph embedding space can then be combined with two decoupled local embeddings to improve the accuracy and robustness of recommendations. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our LGMRec over various state-of-the-art recommendation baselines, showcasing its effectiveness in modeling both local and global user interests.

    "abstract": "Recently, some research show that deep neural networks are vulnerable to the adversarial attacks, the well-trainned samples or patches could be used to trick the neural network detector or human visual perception. However, these adversarial patches, with their conspicuous and unusual patterns, lack camouflage and can easily raise suspicion in the real world. To solve this problem, this paper proposed a novel adversarial patch method called the Latent Diffusion Patch (LDP), in which, a pretrained encoder is first designed to compress the natural images into a feature space with key characteristics. Then trains the diffusion model using the above feature space. Finally, explore the latent space of the pretrained diffusion model using the image denoising technology. It polishes the patches and images through the powerful natural abilities of diffusion models, making them more acceptable to the human visual system. Experimental results, both digital and physical worlds, show that LDPs achieve a visual subjectivity score of 87.3%, while still maintaining effective attack capabilities. ",

    "abstract": "Spatio-temporal forecasting of future values of spatially correlated time series is important across many cyber-physical systems (CPS). Recent studies offer evidence that the use of graph neural networks to capture latent correlations between time series holds a potential for enhanced forecasting. However, most existing methods rely on pre-defined or self-learning graphs, which are either static or unintentionally dynamic, and thus cannot model the time-varying correlations that exhibit trends and periodicities caused by the regularity of the underlying processes in CPS. To tackle such limitation, we propose Time-aware Graph Structure Learning (TagSL), which extracts time-aware correlations among time series by measuring the interaction of node and time representations in high-dimensional spaces. Notably, we introduce time discrepancy learning that utilizes contrastive learning with distance-based regularization terms to constrain learned spatial correlations to a trend sequence. Additionally, we propose a periodic discriminant function to enable the capture of periodic changes from the state of nodes. Next, we present a Graph Convolution-based Gated Recurrent Unit (GCGRU) that jointly captures spatial and temporal dependencies while learning time-aware and node-specific patterns. Finally, we introduce a unified framework named Time-aware Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (TGCRN), combining TagSL, and GCGRU in an encoder-decoder architecture for multi-step spatio-temporal forecasting. We report on experiments with TGCRN and popular existing approaches on five real-world datasets, thus providing evidence that TGCRN is capable of advancing the state-of-the-art. We also cover a detailed ablation study and visualization analysis, offering detailed insight into the effectiveness of time-aware structure learning. ",

However, CL strategies typically require a large number of labeled samples, making their real-life deployment challenging. In this work, we focus on semi-supervised continual learning (SSCL), where the model progressively learns from partially labeled data with unknown categories. We provide a comprehensive analysis of SSCL and demonstrate that unreliable distributions of unlabeled data lead to unstable training and refinement of the progressing stages. This problem severely impacts the performance of SSCL. To address the limitations, we propose a novel approach called Dynamic Sub-Graph Distillation (DSGD) for semi-supervised continual learning, which leverages both semantic and structural information to achieve more stable knowledge distillation on unlabeled data and exhibit robustness against distribution bias. Firstly, we formalize a general model of structural distillation and design a dynamic graph construction for the continual learning progress. Next, we define a structure distillation vector and design a dynamic sub-graph distillation algorithm, which enables end-to-end training and adaptability to scale up tasks. The entire proposed method is adaptable to various CL methods and supervision settings. Finally, experiments conducted on three datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-100, with varying supervision ratios, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem in semi-supervised continual learning scenarios.

The coflow scheduling problem encountered in large data centers is a challenging $\\mathcal{NP}$-hard problem.

Two polynomial-time approximation algorithms are presented in this paper, designed to minimize the total weighted completion time and makespan in heterogeneous parallel networks, respectively. For any given $\\epsilon>0$, our proposed approximation algorithm for minimizing the total weighted completion time achieves approximation ratios of $3 + \\epsilon$ and $2 + \\epsilon$ in the cases of arbitrary and zero release times, respectively.

This finding motivates us to present a novel method that aims to harden GCNs by automatically learning Latent Homophilic Structures over heterophilic graphs. We term such a methodology as LHS. To elaborate, our initial step involves learning a latent structure by employing a novel self-expressive technique based on multi-node interactions. Subsequently, the structure is refined using a pairwisely constrained dual-view contrastive learning approach. We iteratively perform the above procedure, enabling a GCN model to aggregate information in a homophilic way on heterophilic graphs. Armed with such an adaptable structure, we can properly mitigate the structural OOD threats over heterophilic graphs.

Efforts have been made to automate this task, but the variable lighting and hole surface conditions, as well as the requirements for short setup and task execution time make the automation challenging. In this study, we introduce a vision and proprioceptive data-driven robot control model for this task that is robust to challenging lighting and hole surface conditions. This model consists of a spatial attention point network (SAP) and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policy that are trained jointly end-to-end to control the robot. The model is trained in an offline manner, with a sample-efficient framework designed to reduce training time and minimize the reality gap when transferring the model to the physical world. Through evaluations with an industrial robot performing the task in 12 unknown holes, starting from 16 different initial positions, and under three different lighting conditions (two with misleading shadows), we demonstrate that SAP can generate relevant attention points of the image even in challenging lighting conditions. We also show that the proposed model enables task execution with higher success rate and shorter task completion time than various baselines. Due to the proposed model's high effectiveness even in severe lighting, initial positions, and hole conditions, and the offline training framework's high sample-efficiency and short training time, this approach can be easily applied to construction.

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks have shown remarkable performance in image classification. However, their performance significantly deteriorates with corrupted input data. Domain generalization methods have been proposed to train robust models against out-of-distribution data. Data augmentation in the frequency domain is one of such approaches that enable a model to learn phase features to establish domain-invariant representations. This approach changes the amplitudes of the input data while preserving the phases. However, using fixed phases leads to susceptibility to phase fluctuations because amplitudes and phase fluctuations commonly occur in out-of-distribution. In this study, to address this problem, we introduce an approach using finite variation of the phases of input data rather than maintaining fixed phases. Based on the assumption that the degree of domain-invariant features varies for each phase, we propose a method to distinguish phases based on this degree. In addition, we propose a method called vital phase augmentation (VIPAug) that applies the variation to the phases differently according to the degree of domain-invariant features of given phases. The model depends more on the vital phases that contain more domain-invariant features for attaining robustness to amplitude and phase fluctuations. We present experimental evaluations of our proposed approach, which exhibited improved performance for both clean and corrupted data. VIPAug achieved SOTA performance on the benchmark CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, as well as near-SOTA performance on the ImageNet-100 and ImageNet datasets.

We attribute the poor performance to two reasons: biased knowledge transfer between labeled and unlabeled data and noisy representation learning on the unlabeled data. To mitigate these two issues, we propose a Transfer and Alignment Network (TAN), which incorporates two knowledge transfer mechanisms to calibrate the biased knowledge and two feature alignment mechanisms to learn discriminative features. Specifically, we model different categories with prototypes and transfer the prototypes in labeled data to correct model bias towards known categories. On the one hand, we pull instances with known categories in unlabeled data closer to these prototypes to form more compact clusters and avoid boundary overlap between known and novel categories. On the other hand, we use these prototypes to calibrate noisy prototypes estimated from unlabeled data based on category similarities, which allows for more accurate estimation of prototypes for novel categories that can be used as reliable learning targets later. After knowledge transfer, we further propose two feature alignment mechanisms to acquire both instance- and category-level knowledge from unlabeled data by aligning instance features with both augmented features and the calibrated prototypes, which can boost model performance on both known and novel categories with less noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms SOTA methods, especially on novel categories.

We compare the performance of two state-of-the-art models: CodeBERT (Feng et al. 2020), a sequence-based model, and CodeGraph (Yu et al. 2023), a graph-based model, on two benchmark data-sets: BCB (Svajlenko et al. 2014) and PoolC (PoolC no date).

The proposed methods expand the class of technical systems for which direct synthesis of near-optimal control laws is possible. The robustness, adaptability and technical feasibility of neural network controllers make them interesting for practical applications. The main attention in the article is paid to the choice of neural network structure in the imitator and controller, formation of training samples taking into account the limitations of the control object.

    "abstract": "In modern computer networks where sophisticated cyber attacks occur daily, a timely cyber risk assessment becomes paramount. Attack Graph (AG) represents the best-suited solution to model and analyze multi-step attacks on computer networks, although they suffer from poor scalability due to their combinatorial complexity. This paper introduces an analysis-driven framework for AG generation. It enables real-time attack path analysis before the completion of the AG generation with a quantifiable statistical significance. We further accelerate the AG generation by steering it with the analysis query and supporting a novel workflow in which the analyst can query the system anytime. To show the capabilities of the proposed framework, we perform an extensive quantitative validation and we present a realistic case study on networks of unprecedented size. It demonstrates the advantages of our approach in terms of scalability and fitting to common attack path analyses. ",

This paper introduces a new semantic segmentation dataset specifically tailored for construction sites, taking into account the diverse challenges posed by adverse weather and environmental conditions. The dataset is designed to enhance the training and evaluation of object detection models, fostering their adaptability and reliability in real-world construction applications. Our dataset comprises annotated images captured under a wide range of different weather conditions, including but not limited to sunny days, rainy periods, foggy atmospheres, and low-light situations. Additionally, environmental factors such as the existence of dirt/mud on the camera lens are integrated into the dataset through actual captures and synthetic generation to simulate the complex conditions prevalent in construction sites. We also generate synthetic images of the annotations including precise semantic segmentation masks for various objects commonly found in construction environments, such as wheel loader machines, personnel, cars, and structural elements. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we evaluate state-of-the-art object detection algorithms on our proposed benchmark. The results highlight the dataset's success in adversarial training models across diverse conditions, showcasing its efficacy compared to existing datasets that lack such environmental variability.

    "abstract": "Background: Imagine a paper with n nodes on it where each pair undergoes a coin toss experiment; if heads we connect the pair with an undirected link, while tails maintain the disconnection. This procedure yields a random graph. Now consider duplicating this network onto another paper with a slight bias-a fraction of its links (approximately 1/10) undergo rearrangement. If we shuffle the two papers, how can we distinguish the pure random graph from the biased one? Results: In response to this challenge, we propose a novel metric called Randomness Index (RI). The closer the metric to zero is, the higher degree of randomness in the graph. The RI can distinguish between dense small-world networks and dense random graphs; a distinction which is impossible by conventional small-world properties like clustering coefficient and average path length. To validate its effectiveness, we apply the RI to temporal correlation networks of stock indices. Our findings reveal a reduction in randomness during global economic recession periods. Conclusion: The RI emerges as a powerful metric capable of characterizing small-world topology, especially in scenarios where other network measures fail. Beyond its utility in network analysis, the RI is promising for change-point (anomaly) detection in dynamical systems studied by means of multivariate time series. ",

    "abstract": "Ethereum smart contracts, which are autonomous decentralized applications on the blockchain that manage assets often exceeding millions of dollars, have become primary targets for cyberattacks. In 2023 alone, such vulnerabilities led to substantial financial losses exceeding a billion of US dollars. To counter these threats, various tools have been developed by academic and commercial entities to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Our study investigates the gap between the effectiveness of existing security scanners and the vulnerabilities that still persist in practice. We compiled four distinct datasets for this analysis. The first dataset comprises 77,219 source codes extracted directly from the blockchain, while the second includes over 4 million bytecodes obtained from Ethereum Mainnet and testnets. The other two datasets consist of nearly 14,000 manually annotated smart contracts and 373 smart contracts verified through audits, providing a foundation for a rigorous ground truth analysis on bytecode and source code. Using the unlabeled datasets, we conducted a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of 17 vulnerability scanners, revealing considerable discrepancies in their findings. Our analysis of the ground truth datasets indicated poor performance across all the tools we tested. This study unveils the reasons for poor performance and underscores that the current state of the art for smart contract security falls short in effectively addressing open problems, highlighting that the challenge of effectively detecting vulnerabilities remains a significant and unresolved issue.

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Network (GNN) ushered in a new era of machine learning with interconnected datasets. While traditional neural networks can only be trained on independent samples, GNN allows for the inclusion of inter-sample interactions in the training process. This gain, however, incurs additional memory cost, rendering most GNNs unscalable for real-world applications involving vast and complicated networks with tens of millions of nodes (e.g., social circles, web graphs, and brain graphs). This means that storing the graph in the main memory can be difficult, let alone training the GNN model with significantly less GPU memory. While much of the recent literature has focused on either mini-batching GNN methods or quantization, graph reduction methods remain largely scarce. Furthermore, present graph reduction approaches have several drawbacks. First, most graph reduction focuses only on the inference stage (e.g., condensation and distillation) and requires full graph GNN training, which does not reduce training memory footprint. Second, many methods focus solely on the graph's structural aspect, ignoring the initial population feature-label distribution, resulting in a skewed post-reduction label distribution. Here, we propose a Feature-Label COnstrained graph Net collapse, FALCON, to address these limitations. Our three core contributions lie in (i) designing FALCON, a topology-aware graph reduction technique that preserves feature-label distribution; (ii) implementation of FALCON with other memory reduction methods (i.e., mini-batched GNN and quantization) for further memory reduction; (iii) extensive benchmarking and ablation studies against SOTA methods to evaluate FALCON memory reduction. Our extensive results show that FALCON can significantly collapse various public datasets while achieving equal prediction quality across GNN models. Code: https://github.com/basiralab/FALCON ",

    "abstract": "In the In-Context Learning (ICL) setup, various forms of label biases can manifest. One such manifestation is majority label bias, which arises when the distribution of labeled examples in the in-context samples is skewed towards one or more specific classes making Large Language Models (LLMs) more prone to predict those labels. Such discrepancies can arise from various factors, including logistical constraints, inherent biases in data collection methods, limited access to diverse data sources, etc. which are unavoidable in a real-world industry setup. In this work, we study the robustness of in-context learning in LLMs to shifts that occur due to majority label bias within the purview of text classification tasks. Prior works have shown that in-context learning with LLMs is susceptible to such biases. In our study, we go one level deeper and show that the robustness boundary varies widely for different models and tasks, with certain LLMs being highly robust (~90%) to majority label bias. Additionally, our findings also highlight the impact of model size and the richness of instructional prompts contributing towards model robustness.

Integration of CL with graph convolutional network (GCN)-based collaborative filterings (CFs) has been explored in recommender systems. However, current CL-based recommendation models heavily rely on low-pass filters and graph augmentations. In this paper, we propose a novel CL method for recommender systems called the reaction-diffusion graph contrastive learning model (RDGCL). We design our own GCN for CF based on both the diffusion, i.e., low-pass filter, and the reaction, i.e., high-pass filter, equations. Our proposed CL-based training occurs between reaction and diffusion-based embeddings, so there is no need for graph augmentations. Experimental evaluation on 6 benchmark datasets demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art CL-based recommendation models. By enhancing recommendation accuracy and diversity, our method brings an advancement in CL for recommender systems. ",

    "abstract": "Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to achieve object detection only using a few novel class training data. Most of the existing methods usually adopt a transfer-learning strategy to construct the novel class distribution by transferring the base class knowledge. However, this direct way easily results in confusion between the novel class and other similar categories in the decision space. To address the problem, we propose generating local reverse samples (LRSamples) in Prototype Reference Frames to adaptively adjust the center position and boundary range of the novel class distribution to learn more discriminative novel class samples for FSOD. Firstly, we propose a Center Calibration Variance Augmentation (CCVA) module, which contains the selection rule of LRSamples, the generator of LRSamples, and augmentation on the calibrated distribution centers. Specifically, we design an intra-class feature converter (IFC) as the generator of CCVA to learn the selecting rule. By transferring the knowledge of IFC from the base training to fine-tuning, the IFC generates plentiful novel samples to calibrate the novel class distribution. Moreover, we propose a Feature Density Boundary Optimization (FDBO) module to adaptively adjust the importance of samples depending on their distance from the decision boundary. It can emphasize the importance of the high-density area of the similar class (closer decision boundary area) and reduce the weight of the low-density area of the similar class (farther decision boundary area), thus optimizing a clearer decision boundary for each category. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. Our method achieves consistent improvement on the Pascal VOC and MS COCO datasets based on DeFRCN and MFDC baselines. ",

To deal with ZSOC, preceding studies proposed a two-stage pipeline: discovering exemplars and counting. However, there remains a challenge of vulnerability to error propagation of the sequentially designed two-stage process. In this work, an one-stage baseline, Visual-Language Baseline (VLBase), exploring the implicit association of the semantic-patch embeddings of CLIP is proposed. Subsequently, the extension of VLBase to Visual-language Counter (VLCounter) is achieved by incorporating three modules devised to tailor VLBase for object counting. First, Semantic-conditioned Prompt Tuning (SPT) is introduced within the image encoder to acquire target-highlighted representations. Second, Learnable Affine Transformation (LAT) is employed to translate the semantic-patch similarity map to be appropriate for the counting task. Lastly, the layer-wisely encoded features are transferred to the decoder through Segment-aware Skip Connection (SaSC) to keep the generalization capability for unseen classes. Through extensive experiments on FSC147, CARPK, and PUCPR+, the benefits of the end-to-end framework, VLCounter, are demonstrated. ",

    "abstract": "In today's urban landscape, traffic congestion poses a critical challenge, especially during outlier scenarios. These outliers can indicate abrupt traffic peaks, drops, or irregular trends, often arising from factors such as accidents, events, or roadwork. Moreover, Given the dynamic nature of traffic, the need for real-time traffic modeling also becomes crucial to ensure accurate and up-to-date traffic predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Outlier Weighted Autoencoder Modeling (OWAM) framework. OWAM employs autoencoders for local outlier detection and generates correlation scores to assess neighboring traffic's influence. These scores serve as a weighted factor for neighboring sensors, before fusing them into the model. This information enhances the traffic model's performance and supports effective real-time updates, a crucial aspect for capturing dynamic traffic patterns. OWAM demonstrates a favorable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, rendering it highly suitable for real-world applications. The research findings contribute significantly to the development of more efficient and adaptive traffic prediction models, advancing the field of transportation management for the future.

Path formation plays a crucial role in enabling cooperative swarm robots to accomplish these tasks. The paper presents a method called the sub-goal-based path formation, which establishes a path between two different locations by exploiting visually connected sub-goals. Simulation experiments conducted in the Argos simulator demonstrate the successful formation of paths in the majority of trials. Furthermore, the paper tackles the problem of inter-collision (traffic) among a large number of robots engaged in path formation, which negatively impacts the performance of the sub-goal-based method. To mitigate this issue, a task allocation strategy is proposed, leveraging local communication protocols and light signal-based communication. The strategy evaluates the distance between points and determines the required number of robots for the path formation task, reducing unwanted exploration and traffic congestion. The performance of the sub-goal-based path formation and task allocation strategy is evaluated by comparing path length, time, and resource reduction against the A* algorithm. The simulation experiments demonstrate promising results, showcasing the scalability, robustness, and fault tolerance characteristics of the proposed approach. ",

To shelter the covert communications, Alice transmits additional dual-functional artificial noise (DFAN) with a varying power not only to create uncertainty at Willie's signal reception to confuse Willie but also to sense the targets simultaneously. Based on this framework, the weighted sum of the sensing beampattern means square error (MSE) and cross correlation is minimized by jointly optimizing the covert communication and DFAN signals subject to the minimum covert rate requirement. The robust design considers both cases of imperfect Willie's CSI (WCSI) and statistical WCSI. Under the worst-case assumption that Willie can adaptively adjust the detection threshold to achieve the best detection performance, the minimum detection error probability (DEP) at Willie is analytically derived in the closed-form expression. The formulated covertness constrained optimization problems are tackled by a feasibility-checking based difference-of-convex relaxation (DC) algorithm utilizing the S-procedure, Bernstein-type inequality, and the DC method. Simulation results validate the feasibility of the proposed scheme and demonstrate the covertness performance gains achieved by our proposed design over various benchmarks. ",

To address this gap, we define Internet Learning (IL) including its data splitting and network context and which puts good performance under extreme dynamic condition of clients as the primary goal. We propose VFL as a naive baseline and develop several extensions to handle the IL paradigm of learning.

    "title": "Forgery-aware Adaptive Transformer for Generalizable Synthetic Image  Detection",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of generalizable synthetic image detection, aiming to detect forgery images from diverse generative methods, e.g., GANs and diffusion models. Cutting-edge solutions start to explore the benefits of pre-trained models, and mainly follow the fixed paradigm of solely training an attached classifier, e.g., combining frozen CLIP-ViT with a learnable linear layer in UniFD. However, our analysis shows that such a fixed paradigm is prone to yield detectors with insufficient learning regarding forgery representations. We attribute the key challenge to the lack of forgery adaptation, and present a novel forgery-aware adaptive transformer approach, namely FatFormer. Based on the pre-trained vision-language spaces of CLIP, FatFormer introduces two core designs for the adaption to build generalized forgery representations. First, motivated by the fact that both image and frequency analysis are essential for synthetic image detection, we develop a forgery-aware adapter to adapt image features to discern and integrate local forgery traces within image and frequency domains. Second, we find that considering the contrastive objectives between adapted image features and text prompt embeddings, a previously overlooked aspect, results in a nontrivial generalization improvement. Accordingly, we introduce language-guided alignment to supervise the forgery adaptation with image and text prompts in FatFormer. Experiments show that, by coupling these two designs, our approach tuned on 4-class ProGAN data attains a remarkable detection performance, achieving an average of 98% accuracy to unseen GANs, and surprisingly generalizes to unseen diffusion models with 95% accuracy.

We proposed a multi-channel sensor network construction method involving hardware, acquisition, and synchronization in the smart home environment and a smart home data fusion method (SHDFM) for multi-modal data (position, gait, voice, pose, facial expression, temperature, and humidity) generated in the smart home environment to address the configuration of a multi-channel sensor network, improve the quality and efficiency of various human activities and environmental data collection, and reduce the difficulty of multi-modal data fusion in the smart home. SHDFM contains 5 levels, with inputs and outputs as criteria to provide recommendations for multi-modal data fusion strategies in the smart home. We built a real experimental environment using the proposed method in this paper. To validate our method, we created a real experimental environment - a physical setup in a home-like scenario where the multi-channel sensor network and data fusion techniques were deployed and evaluated. The acceptance and testing results show that the proposed construction and data fusion methods can be applied to the examples with high robustness, replicability, and scalability. Besides, we discuss how smart homes with multi-channel sensor networks can support digital twins. ",

    "abstract": "Rough set theory is a well-known mathematical framework that can deal with inconsistent data by providing lower and upper approximations of concepts. A prominent property of these approximations is their granular representation: that is, they can be written as unions of simple sets, called granules. The latter can be identified with \"if. . . , then. . . \" rules, which form the backbone of rough set rule induction. It has been shown previously that this property can be maintained for various fuzzy rough set models, including those based on ordered weighted average (OWA) operators. In this paper, we will focus on some instances of the general class of fuzzy quantifier-based fuzzy rough sets (FQFRS). In these models, the lower and upper approximations are evaluated using binary and unary fuzzy quantifiers, respectively. One of the main targets of this study is to examine the granular representation of different models of FQFRS. The main findings reveal that Choquet-based fuzzy rough sets can be represented granularly under the same conditions as OWA-based fuzzy rough sets, whereas Sugeno-based FRS can always be represented granularly. This observation highlights the potential of these models for resolving data inconsistencies and managing noise. ",

    "abstract": "Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies, such as LoRa, have gained significant attention for their ability to enable long-range, low-power communication for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the security of LoRa networks remains a major concern, particularly in scenarios where device identification and classification of legitimate and spoofed signals are crucial. This paper studies a deep learning framework to address these challenges, considering LoRa device identification and legitimate vs. rogue LoRa device classification tasks. A deep neural network (DNN), either a convolutional neural network (CNN) or feedforward neural network (FNN), is trained for each task by utilizing real experimental I/Q data for LoRa signals, while rogue signals are generated by using kernel density estimation (KDE) of received signals by rogue devices. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM)-based adversarial attacks are considered for LoRa signal classification tasks using deep learning models. The impact of these attacks is assessed on the performance of two tasks, namely device identification and legitimate vs. rogue device classification, by utilizing separate or common perturbations against these signal classification tasks. Results presented in this paper quantify the level of transferability of adversarial attacks on different LoRa signal classification tasks as a major vulnerability and highlight the need to make IoT applications robust to adversarial attacks.

Building upon findings from 2022 Landslide4Sense Competition, we propose a deep neural network based system for landslide detection and segmentation from multisource remote sensing image input. We use a U-Net trained with Cross Entropy loss as baseline model. We then improve the U-Net baseline model by leveraging a wide range of deep learning techniques. In particular, we conduct feature engineering by generating new band data from the original bands, which helps to enhance the quality of remote sensing image input. Regarding the network architecture, we replace traditional convolutional layers in the U-Net baseline by a residual-convolutional layer. We also propose an attention layer which leverages the multi-head attention scheme. Additionally, we generate multiple output masks with three different resolutions, which creates an ensemble of three outputs in the inference process to enhance the performance. Finally, we propose a combined loss function which leverages Focal loss and IoU loss to train the network. Our experiments on the development set of the Landslide4Sense challenge achieve an F1 score and an mIoU score of 84.07 and 76.07, respectively. Our best model setup outperforms the challenge baseline and the proposed U-Net baseline, improving the F1 score/mIoU score by 6.8/7.4 and 10.5/8.8, respectively. ",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, sweet orange crop forecasting has involved manually counting fruits from numerous trees, which is a labor-intensive process. Automatic systems for fruit counting, based on proximal imaging, computer vision, and machine learning, have been considered a promising alternative or complement to manual counting. These systems require data association components that prevent multiple counting of the same fruit observed in different images. However, there is a lack of work evaluating the accuracy of multiple fruit counting, especially considering (i) occluded and re-entering green fruits on leafy trees, and (ii) counting ground-truth data measured in the crop field. We propose a non-invasive alternative that utilizes fruit counting from videos, implemented as a pipeline. Firstly, we employ CNNs for the detection of visible fruits. Inter-frame association techniques are then applied to track the fruits across frames. To handle occluded and re-appeared fruit, we introduce a relocalization component that employs 3-D estimation of fruit locations. Finally, a neural network regressor is utilized to estimate the total number of fruit, integrating image-based fruit counting with other tree data such as crop variety and tree size. The results demonstrate that the performance of our approach is closely tied to the quality of the field-collected videos. By ensuring that at least 30% of the fruit is accurately detected, tracked, and counted, our yield regressor achieves an impressive coefficient of determination of 0.85. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents one of the few endeavors in fruit estimation that incorporates manual fruit counting as a reference point for evaluation. We also introduce annotated datasets for multiple orange tracking (MOrangeT) and detection (OranDet), publicly available to foster the development of novel methods for image-based fruit counting. ",

These functionals share the same structure as the functionals of complete type, and also they share to be defined via their derivative along solutions of the nominal system. The defining equation for the derivative, however, is chosen differently: the Lyapunov equation, which forms the template for the defining equation of complete-type Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, is replaced by the template of an algebraic Riccati equation. Properties of the proposed Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals of robust type are proven in the present article. Moreover, existence conditions are derived from the infinite-dimensional Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma, combined with a splitting approach. The concept is tailored to sector-based absolute stability problems, and the obtainable robustness bounds are strongly related to the small-gain theorem, the complex stability radius, passivity theorems, the circle criterion, and integral quadratic constraints with constant multipliers, where, however, the nominal system itself has a time delay.

It has recently been used to identify the presence of individuals infected with COVID-19. To monitor large communities and accurately localize buildings with infected individuals with a limited number of sensors, one must carefully choose the sampling locations in wastewater networks. We also have to account for concentration requirements on the collected wastewater samples to ensure reliable virus presence test results. We model this as a sensor placement problem. Although sensor placement for source localization arises in numerous problems, most approaches use application-specific heuristics and fail to consider multiple source scenarios. To address these limitations, we develop a novel approach that combines Bayesian networks and discrete optimization to efficiently identify informative sensor placements and accurately localize virus sources. Our approach also takes into account concentration requirements on wastewater samples during optimization. Our simulation experiments demonstrate the quality of our sensor placements and the accuracy of our source localization approach. Furthermore, we show the robustness of our approach to discrepancies between the virus outbreak model and the actual outbreak rates. ",

Existing methods often assume correct annotations during training, disregarding the impact of noisy annotations, especially in crowded scenes.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a Scale-Aware Crowd Counting Network (SACC-Net) that introduces a ``scale-aware'' architecture with error-correcting capabilities of noisy annotations.

Furthermore, the proposed adaptive Gaussian kernel variance enables the model to learn dynamically with a low-rank approximation, leading to improved convergence efficiency with comparable accuracy. The performance of SACC-Net is extensively evaluated on four public datasets: UCF-QNRF, UCF CC 50, NWPU, and ShanghaiTech A-B.

    "abstract": "With the release of increasing open-source emotion recognition datasets on social media platforms and the rapid development of computing resources, multimodal emotion recognition tasks (MER) have begun to receive widespread research attention. The MER task extracts and fuses complementary semantic information from different modalities, which can classify the speaker's emotions. However, the existing feature fusion methods have usually mapped the features of different modalities into the same feature space for information fusion, which can not eliminate the heterogeneity between different modalities. Therefore, it is challenging to make the subsequent emotion class boundary learning. To tackle the above problems, we have proposed a novel Adversarial Representation with Intra-Modal and Inter-Modal Graph Contrastive for Multimodal Emotion Recognition (AR-IIGCN) method. Firstly, we input video, audio, and text features into a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to map them into separate feature spaces. Secondly, we build a generator and a discriminator for the three modal features through adversarial representation, which can achieve information interaction between modalities and eliminate heterogeneity among modalities. Thirdly, we introduce contrastive graph representation learning to capture intra-modal and inter-modal complementary semantic information and learn intra-class and inter-class boundary information of emotion categories. Specifically, we construct a graph structure for three modal features and perform contrastive representation learning on nodes with different emotions in the same modality and the same emotion in different modalities, which can improve the feature representation ability of nodes. Extensive experimental works show that the ARL-IIGCN method can significantly improve emotion recognition accuracy on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets. ",

Existing GNNs are primarily designed to learn node-wise representations and usually fail to capture pairwise relations between target nodes, which proves to be crucial for link prediction. Recent works resort to learning more expressive edge-wise representations by enhancing vanilla GNNs with structural features such as labeling tricks and link prediction heuristics, but they suffer from high computational overhead and limited scalability. To tackle this issue, we propose to learn structural link representations by augmenting the message-passing framework of GNNs with Bloom signatures. Bloom signatures are hashing-based compact encodings of node neighborhoods, which can be efficiently merged to recover various types of edge-wise structural features. We further show that any type of neighborhood overlap-based heuristic can be estimated by a neural network that takes Bloom signatures as input. GNNs with Bloom signatures are provably more expressive than vanilla GNNs and also more scalable than existing edge-wise models. Experimental results on five standard link prediction benchmarks show that our proposed model achieves comparable or better performance than existing edge-wise GNN models while being 3-200 $\\times$ faster and more memory-efficient for online inference.

Recent augmentation-based methods showed that MP neural networks often perform poorly on low-degree nodes, leading to degree biases due to a lack of messages reaching low-degree nodes. Despite their success, most methods use heuristic or uniform random augmentations, which are non-differentiable and may not always generate valuable edges for learning representations. In this paper, we propose Community-aware Graph Transformers, namely CGT, to learn degree-unbiased representations based on learnable augmentations and graph transformers by extracting within community structures. We first design a learnable graph augmentation to generate more within-community edges connecting low-degree nodes through edge perturbation. Second, we propose an improved self-attention to learn underlying proximity and the roles of nodes within the community. Third, we propose a self-supervised learning task that could learn the representations to preserve the global graph structure and regularize the graph augmentations. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets showed CGT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and significantly improves the node degree biases.

To address this challenge in wireless sensor networks, we propose to use power as a new dimension for interference graph estimation (IGE) and integrate IGE with concurrent flooding such that IGE can be done simultaneously with flooding using the same frequency-time resources. With controlled and real-world experiments, we show that it is feasible to efficiently achieve IGE via concurrent flooding on the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices by controlling the transmit powers of nodes.

    "abstract": "The optimization problem associated to fitting two-layer ReLU networks having $d$~inputs, $k$~neurons, and labels generated by a target network, is considered. Two categories of infinite families of minima, giving one minimum per $d$ and $k$, were recently found. The loss at minima belonging to the first category converges to zero as $d$ increases. In the second category, the loss remains bounded away from zero. That being so, how may one avoid minima belonging to the latter category? Fortunately, such minima are never detected by standard optimization methods. Motivated by questions concerning the nature of this phenomenon, we develop methods to study distinctive analytic properties of hidden minima. By existing analyses, the Hessian spectrum of both categories agree modulus $O(d^{-1/2})$-terms -- not promising. Thus, rather, our investigation proceeds by studying curves along which the loss is minimized or maximized, referred to as tangency arcs. We prove that pure, seemingly remote, group representation-theoretic considerations concerning the arrangement of subspaces invariant to the action of subgroups of $S_d$, the symmetry group over $d$ symbols, relative to ones fixed by the action yield a precise description of all finitely many admissible types of tangency arcs. The general results applied for the loss function reveal that arcs emanating from hidden minima differ, characteristically, by their structure and symmetry, precisely on account of the $O(d^{-1/2})$-eigenvalue terms absent in previous work, indicating the subtly of the analysis. The theoretical results, stated and proved for o-minimal structures, show that the set comprising all tangency arcs is topologically sufficiently tame, permitting a numerical construction of tangency arcs, and ultimately, a comparison of how minima from both categories are positioned relative to adjacent critical points.

    "abstract": "We study a Stackelberg game between an attacker and a defender on large Active Directory (AD) attack graphs where the defender employs a set of honeypots to stop the attacker from reaching high-value targets. Contrary to existing works that focus on small and static attack graphs, AD graphs typically contain hundreds of thousands of nodes and edges and constantly change over time. We consider two types of attackers: a simple attacker who cannot observe honeypots and a competent attacker who can. To jointly solve the game, we propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation. We observed that the optimal blocking plan for static graphs performs poorly in dynamic graphs. To solve the dynamic graph problem, we re-design the mixed-integer programming formulation by combining m MIP (dyMIP(m)) instances to produce a near-optimal blocking plan. Furthermore, to handle a large number of dynamic graph instances, we use a clustering algorithm to efficiently find the m-most representative graph instances for a constant m (dyMIP(m)). We prove a lower bound on the optimal blocking strategy for dynamic graphs and show that our dyMIP(m) algorithms produce close to optimal results for a range of AD graphs under realistic conditions.

    "abstract": "Recently, serious concerns have been raised about the privacy issues related to training datasets in machine learning algorithms when including personal data. Various regulations in different countries, including the GDPR grant individuals to have personal data erased, known as 'the right to be forgotten' or 'the right to erasure'. However, there has been less research on effectively and practically deleting the requested personal data from the training set while not jeopardizing the overall machine learning performance. In this work, we propose a fast and novel machine unlearning paradigm at the layer level called layer attack unlearning, which is highly accurate and fast compared to existing machine unlearning algorithms. We introduce the Partial-PGD algorithm to locate the samples to forget efficiently. In addition, we only use the last layer of the model inspired by the Forward-Forward algorithm for unlearning process. Lastly, we use Knowledge Distillation (KD) to reliably learn the decision boundaries from the teacher using soft label information to improve accuracy performance. We conducted extensive experiments with SOTA machine unlearning models and demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach for accuracy and end-to-end unlearning performance. ",

    "abstract": "With the continuous popularity of deep learning and representation learning, fast vector search becomes a vital task in various ranking/retrieval based applications, say recommendation, ads ranking and question answering. Neural network based ranking is widely adopted due to its powerful capacity in modeling complex relationships, such as between users and items, questions and answers. However, it is usually exploited in offline or re-ranking manners for it is time-consuming in computations. Online neural network ranking--so called fast neural ranking--is considered challenging because neural network measures are usually non-convex and asymmetric. Traditional Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search which usually focuses on metric ranking measures, is not applicable to these advanced measures. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph searching framework to accelerate the searching in the fast neural ranking problem. The proposed graph searching algorithm is bi-level: we first construct a probable candidate set; then we only evaluate the neural network measure over the probable candidate set instead of evaluating the neural network over all neighbors. Specifically, we propose a gradient-based algorithm that approximates the rank of the neural network matching score to construct the probable candidate set; and we present an angle-based heuristic procedure to adaptively identify the proper size of the probable candidate set. Empirical results on public data confirm the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. ",

First, existing VGAEs do not account for the discrepancy between the inference and generative models after incorporating the clustering inductive bias. Second, current models are prone to degenerate solutions that make the latent codes match the prior independently of the input signal (i.e., Posterior Collapse). Third, existing VGAEs overlook the effect of the noisy clustering assignments (i.e., Feature Randomness) and the impact of the strong trade-off between clustering and reconstruction (i.e., Feature Drift). To address these problems, we formulate a variational lower bound in a contrastive setting. Our lower bound is a tighter approximation of the log-likelihood function than the corresponding Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO). Thanks to a newly identified term, our lower bound can escape Posterior Collapse and has more flexibility to account for the difference between the inference and generative models. Additionally, our solution has two mechanisms to control the trade-off between Feature Randomness and Feature Drift. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art clustering results on several datasets. We provide strong evidence that this improvement is attributed to four aspects: integrating contrastive learning and alleviating Feature Randomness, Feature Drift, and Posterior Collapse. ",

In this paper, we introduce METER, a novel dynamic concept adaptation framework that introduces a new paradigm for OAD. METER addresses concept drift by first training a base detection model on historical data to capture recurring central concepts, and then learning to dynamically adapt to new concepts in data streams upon detecting concept drift. Particularly, METER employs a novel dynamic concept adaptation technique that leverages a hypernetwork to dynamically generate the parameter shift of the base detection model, providing a more effective and efficient solution than conventional retraining or fine-tuning approaches. Further, METER incorporates a lightweight drift detection controller, underpinned by evidential deep learning, to support robust and interpretable concept drift detection. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation, and the results show that METER significantly outperforms existing OAD approaches in various application scenarios. ",

In recent years, several methods have been developed to address this problem. However, the need for more effective and specialized approaches grows with the production of graph data with diverse characteristics. In particular, real-world multiplex graphs may exhibit a high number of dimensions, making it difficult to construct a single consensus representation. Furthermore, important information can be hidden in complex latent structures scattered in multiple dimensions. To address these issues, we propose HMGE, a novel embedding method based on hierarchical aggregation for high-dimensional multiplex graphs. Hierarchical aggregation consists of learning a hierarchical combination of the graph dimensions and refining the embeddings at each hierarchy level. Non-linear combinations are computed from previous ones, thus uncovering complex information and latent structures hidden in the multiplex graph dimensions. Moreover, we leverage mutual information maximization between local patches and global summaries to train the model without supervision. This allows to capture of globally relevant information present in diverse locations of the graph. Detailed experiments on synthetic and real-world data illustrate the suitability of our approach to downstream supervised tasks, including link prediction and node classification. ",

For coping with this problem, several sensor data simulators have been proposed, but they have not been able to model appropriately the long-term transitions and correlations between anomalies that exist in reality. In this paper, therefore, we propose a novel sensor data simulator that can model these factors in generation of sensor data. Anomalies considered in this study were classified into three types of \\textit{state anomalies}, \\textit{activity anomalies}, and \\textit{moving anomalies}. The simulator produces 10 years data in 100 min. including six anomalies, two for each type.

More and more recent works employ different graph-based models for MPP, which have made considerable progress in improving prediction performance. However, current models often ignore relationships between molecules, which could be also helpful for MPP. For this sake, in this paper we propose a graph structure learning (GSL) based MPP approach, called GSL-MPP. Specifically, we first apply graph neural network (GNN) over molecular graphs to extract molecular representations. Then, with molecular fingerprints, we construct a molecular similarity graph (MSG). Following that, we conduct graph structure learning on the MSG (i.e., molecule-level graph structure learning) to get the final molecular embeddings, which are the results of fusing both GNN encoded molecular representations and the relationships among molecules, i.e., combining both intra-molecule and inter-molecule information. Finally, we use these molecular embeddings to perform MPP. Extensive experiments on seven various benchmark datasets show that our method could achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases, especially on classification tasks. Further visualization studies also demonstrate the good molecular representations of our method. ",

In this work, one well-known adversarial attack known as the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) is explored and its adverse effects on the performances of image classification models are examined. The FGSM attack is simulated on three pre-trained image classifier CNN architectures, ResNet-101, AlexNet, and RegNetY 400MF using randomly chosen images from the ImageNet dataset. The classification accuracies of the models are computed in the absence and presence of the attack to demonstrate the detrimental effect of the attack on the performances of the classifiers. Finally, a mechanism is proposed to defend against the FGSM attack based on a modified defensive distillation-based approach.

However, recognition of a person can be hindered when their clothing is decorated with carefully designed graffiti patterns, leading to the failure of object detection. To achieve greater attack potential against unknown black-box models, adversarial patches capable of affecting the outputs of multiple-object detection models are required. While ensemble models have proven effective, current research in the field of object detection typically focuses on the simple fusion of the outputs of all models, with limited attention being given to developing general adversarial patches that can function effectively in the physical world. In this paper, we introduce the concept of energy and treat the adversarial patches generation process as an optimization of the adversarial patches to minimize the total energy of the ``person'' category. Additionally, by adopting adversarial training, we construct a dynamically optimized ensemble model. During training, the weight parameters of the attacked target models are adjusted to find the balance point at which the generated adversarial patches can effectively attack all target models. We carried out six sets of comparative experiments and tested our algorithm on five mainstream object detection models. The adversarial patches generated by our algorithm can reduce the recognition accuracy of YOLOv2 and YOLOv3 to 13.19\\% and 29.20\\%, respectively. In addition, we conducted experiments to test the effectiveness of T-shirts covered with our adversarial patches in the physical world and could achieve that people are not recognized by the object detection model.

The clustering quality is important to the utility of k-BGC in various applications like social network analysis, recommendation systems, text mining, and bioinformatics, to name a few. Existing approaches to k-BGC either output clustering results with compromised quality due to inadequate exploitation of high-order information between vertices, or fail to handle sizable bipartite graphs with billions of edges. Motivated by this, this paper presents two efficient k-BGC solutions, HOPE and HOPE+, which achieve state-of-the-art performance on large-scale bipartite graphs. HOPE obtains high scalability and effectiveness through a new k-BGC problem formulation based on the novel notion of high-order perspective (HOP) vectors and an efficient technique for low-rank approximation of HOP vectors. HOPE+ further elevates the k-BGC performance to another level with a judicious problem transformation and a highly efficient two-stage optimization framework. Two variants, HOPE+ (FNEM) and HOPE+ (SNEM) are designed when either the Frobenius norm or spectral norm is applied in the transformation. Extensive experiments, comparing HOPE and HOPE+ against 13 competitors on 10 real-world datasets, exhibit that our solutions, especially HOPE+, are superior to existing methods in terms of result quality, while being up to orders of magnitude faster. On the largest dataset MAG with 1.1 billion edges, HOPE+ is able to produce clusters with the highest clustering accuracy within 31 minutes, which is unmatched by any existing solution for k-BGC. ",

Motivated by this, we propose an efficient query strategy, termed as DeLR, that Decoupling the Localization and Recognition for active query. In this way, we are probably free of class annotations when the localization is correct, and able to assign the labeling budget for more informative samples. There are two main differences in DeLR: 1) Unlike previous methods mostly focus on image-level annotations, where the queried samples are selected and exhausted annotated. In DeLR, the query is based on region-level, and we only annotate the object region that is queried; 2) Instead of directly providing both localization and recognition annotations, we separately query the two components, and thus reduce the recognition budget with the pseudo class labels provided by the model. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate its superiority. We hope our proposed query strategy would shed light on researches in active learning in object detection. ",

    "abstract": "Learning a graph from data is the key to taking advantage of graph signal processing tools. Most of the conventional algorithms for graph learning require complete data statistics, which might not be available in some scenarios. In this work, we aim to learn a graph from incomplete time-series observations. From another viewpoint, we consider the problem of semi-blind recovery of time-varying graph signals where the underlying graph model is unknown. We propose an algorithm based on the method of block successive upperbound minimization (BSUM), for simultaneous inference of the signal and the graph from incomplete data. Simulation results on synthetic and real time-series demonstrate the performance of the proposed method for graph learning and signal recovery. ",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has driven significant progress in object detection using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. Existing methods, while achieving promising results, often struggle to effectively integrate local and global information, particularly direction-aware features. This paper proposes SAR-Net, a novel framework specifically designed for global fusion of direction-aware information in SAR object detection. SAR-Net leverages two key innovations: the Unity Compensation Mechanism (UCM) and the Direction-aware Attention Module (DAM). UCM facilitates the establishment of complementary relationships among features across different scales, enabling efficient global information fusion. Among them, Multi-scale Alignment Module (MAM) and distinct Multi-level Fusion Module (MFM) enhance feature integration by capturing both texture detail and semantic information. Then, Multi-feature Embedding Module (MEM) feeds back global features into the primary branches, further improving information transmission. Additionally, DAM, through bidirectional attention polymerization, captures direction-aware information, effectively eliminating background interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SAR-Net, achieving state-of-the-art results on aircraft (SAR-AIRcraft-1.0) and ship datasets (SSDD, HRSID), confirming its generalization capability and robustness.

    "abstract": "Recently, the evolution of deep learning has promoted the application of machine learning (ML) to various systems. However, there are ML systems, such as autonomous vehicles, that cause critical damage when they misclassify. Conversely, there are ML-specific attacks called adversarial attacks based on the characteristics of ML systems. For example, one type of adversarial attack is an evasion attack, which uses minute perturbations called \"adversarial examples\" to intentionally misclassify classifiers. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the risk of ML-specific attacks in introducing ML base systems. In this study, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for analyzing the risk of evasion attacks using attack trees. The proposed method consists of the extension of the conventional attack tree to analyze evasion attacks and the systematic construction method of the extension. In the extension of the conventional attack tree, we introduce ML and conventional attack nodes to represent various characteristics of evasion attacks. In the systematic construction process, we propose a procedure to construct the attack tree. The procedure consists of three steps: (1) organizing information about attack methods in the literature to a matrix, (2) identifying evasion attack scenarios from methods in the matrix, and (3) constructing the attack tree from the identified scenarios using a pattern. Finally, we conducted experiments on three ML image recognition systems to demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our proposed method. ",

The adaptive flip graph algorithm addresses the inherent limitations of exploration and inefficient search encountered in the original flip graph algorithm, particularly when dealing with large matrix multiplication. For the limitation of exploration, the proposed algorithm adaptively transitions over the flip graph, introducing a flexibility that does not strictly reduce the number of multiplications. Concerning the issue of inefficient search in large instances, the proposed algorithm adaptively constraints the search range instead of relying on a completely random search, facilitating more effective exploration. Numerical experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptive flip graph algorithm, showing a reduction in the number of multiplications for a $4\\times 5$ matrix multiplied by a $5\\times 5$ matrix from $76$ to $73$, and that from $95$ to $94$ for a $5 \\times 5$ matrix multiplied by another $5\\times 5$ matrix.

We obtain these relevance measures by minimizing an objective function mixing diversity, representativity and uncertainty. These criteria when combined allow exploring different data modes and also refining change detections.

    "abstract": "Multi-layer ultra-dense satellite networks (MLUDSNs) have soared this meteoric to provide vast throughputd for globally diverse services. Differing from traditional monolayer constellations, MLUDSNs emphasize the spatial integration among layers, and its throughput may not be simply the sum of throughput of each layer. The hop-count of cross-layer communication paths can be reduced by deploying inter-layer connections (ILCs), augmenting MLUDSN's throughput. Therefore, it remains an open issue how to deploy ILCs to optimize the dynamic MLUDSN topology to dramatically raise throughput gains under multi-layer collaboration. This paper designs an ILC deployment strategy to enhance throughput by revealing the impacts of ILC distribution on reducing hop-count. Since deploying ILCs burdens the satellite with extra communication resource consumption, we model the ILC deployment problem as minimizing the average hop with limited ILCs, to maximize throughput. The proposed problem is a typical integer linear programming (ILP) problem, of which computational complexity is exponential as the satellite scale expands and the time evolves. Based on the symmetrical topology of each layer, we propose a two-phase deployment scheme to halve the problem scale and prioritize stable ILCs to reduce handover-count, which decreases the exponential complexity to a polynomial one, with 1% estimation error: Simulation results based on realistic megaconstellation information confirm that the optimal number of ILCs is less than P.S/2, where P and S are orbits and satellites per orbit. Besides, these ILCs deploy uniformly in each layer, which raises over 1.55x throughput than isolated layers. ",

Although lots of adversarial attack algorithms have been developed, it is still challenging in the practical scenario that the model's parameters and architectures are inaccessible to the attacker/evaluator, i.e., black-box adversarial attacks. Due to the practical importance, there has been rapid progress from recent algorithms, reflected by the quick increase in attack success rate and the quick decrease in query numbers to the target model. However, there is a lack of thorough evaluations and comparisons among these algorithms, causing difficulties of tracking the real progress, analyzing advantages and disadvantages of different technical routes, as well as designing future development roadmap of this field. Thus, in this work, we aim at building a comprehensive benchmark of black-box adversarial attacks, called BlackboxBench. It mainly provides: 1) a unified, extensible and modular-based codebase, implementing 25 query-based attack algorithms and 30 transfer-based attack algorithms; 2) comprehensive evaluations: we evaluate the implemented algorithms against several mainstreaming model architectures on 2 widely used datasets (CIFAR-10 and a subset of ImageNet), leading to 14,106 evaluations in total; 3) thorough analysis and new insights, as well analytical tools.

In this work, we propose to extend a generalization of the Sugeno integral to work with interval-valued data. Then, we use this integral to aggregate interval-valued data in two different settings: first, we study the use of intervals in a brain-computer interface; secondly, we study how to construct interval-valued relationships in a social network, and how to aggregate their information. Our results show that interval-valued data can effectively model some of the uncertainty and coalitions of the data in both cases. For the case of brain-computer interface, we found that our results surpassed the results of other interval-valued functions. ",

We approach multi-view, single-person 3D human pose reconstruction as a regression problem and propose a novel encoder-decoder Transformer architecture to estimate 3D poses from multi-view 2D pose sequences. The encoder refines 2D skeleton joints detected across different views and times, fusing multi-view and temporal information through global self-attention. We enhance the encoder by incorporating a geometry-biased attention mechanism, effectively leveraging geometric relationships between views. Additionally, we use detection scores provided by the 2D pose detector to further guide the encoder's attention based on the reliability of the 2D detections. The decoder subsequently regresses the 3D pose sequence from these refined tokens, using pre-defined queries for each joint. To enhance the generalization of our method to unseen scenes and improve resilience to missing joints, we implement strategies including scene centering, synthetic views, and token dropout. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark public datasets, Human3.6M, CMU Panoptic and Occlusion-Persons. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, particularly in occluded scenes and when few views are available, which are traditionally challenging scenarios for triangulation-based methods.

Previous methods typically constructs a dense 3D volume, neglecting the inherent sparsity of the scene, which results in a high computational cost. Furthermore, these methods are limited to semantic occupancy and fail to differentiate between distinct instances. To exploit the sparsity property and ensure instance-awareness, we introduce a novel fully sparse panoptic occupancy network, termed SparseOcc. SparseOcc initially reconstructs a sparse 3D representation from visual inputs. Subsequently, it employs sparse instance queries to predict each object instance from the sparse 3D representation. These instance queries interact with 2D features via mask-guided sparse sampling, thereby circumventing the need for costly dense features or global attention. Additionally, we have established the first-ever vision-centric panoptic occupancy benchmark. SparseOcc demonstrates its efficacy on the Occ3D-nus dataset by achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 26.0, while maintaining a real-time inference speed of 25.4 FPS. By incorporating temporal modeling from the preceding 8 frames, SparseOcc further improves its performance, achieving 30.9 mIoU without whistles and bells. Code will be made available. ",

    "abstract": "This work explores cascading failures in networked control systems by employing a platoon of vehicles that exchange information over a time-delayed communication graph as a model. We study the roles of network connectivity, system dynamics, communication time-delay, and uncertainty in the emergence of these failure phenomena. Our results yield closed-form expressions for the average value-at-risk (AV@R), which we utilize as a coherent risk measure to quantify the cascading effect of vehicle collisions within a platoon. These findings are further extended with several standard communication graphs with symmetries to reveal the impact of graph design parameters on the risk of cascading collisions. By presenting the boundedness of the steady-state statistics of the inter-vehicle distances, we present the best achievable risk of cascading collision with general graph topologies, which is further specified for special communication graph such as the complete graph. Our theoretical findings pave the way for the development of a robust framework designed to mitigate the risk of cascading collisions in vehicle platoons by exploring how platoon reacts to the various existing failures and the change of communication links.

Experiments demonstrate our Focusing Sampling strategy, emphasizing vital distant details unlike uniform approaches, significantly boosts both benchmark and practical curved/distant lane recognition accuracy essential for safety. While FENetV1 achieves state-of-the-art conventional metric performance via enhancements isolating perspective-aware contexts mimicking driver vision, FENetV2 proves most reliable on the proposed Partial Field analysis. Hence we specifically recommend V2 for practical lane navigation despite fractional degradation on standard entire-image measures. Future directions include collecting on-road data and integrating complementary dual frameworks to further breakthroughs guided by human perception principles. Code will be made available. ",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the poisoning attack and defense interactions in a federated learning (FL) system, specifically in the context of wireless signal classification using deep learning for next-generation (NextG) communications. FL collectively trains a global model without the need for clients to exchange their data samples. By leveraging geographically dispersed clients, the trained global model can be used for incumbent user identification, facilitating spectrum sharing. However, in this distributed learning system, the presence of malicious clients introduces the risk of poisoning the training data to manipulate the global model through falsified local model exchanges. To address this challenge, a proactive defense mechanism is employed in this paper to make informed decisions regarding the admission or rejection of clients participating in FL systems. Consequently, the attack-defense interactions are modeled as a game, centered around the underlying admission and poisoning decisions. First, performance bounds are established, encompassing the best and worst strategies for attackers and defenders. Subsequently, the attack and defense utilities are characterized within the Nash equilibrium, where no player can unilaterally improve its performance given the fixed strategies of others. The results offer insights into novel operational modes that safeguard FL systems against poisoning attacks by quantifying the performance of both attacks and defenses in the context of NextG communications.

    "abstract": "Causal confusion is a phenomenon where an agent learns a policy that reflects imperfect spurious correlations in the data. Such a policy may falsely appear to be optimal during training if most of the training data contain such spurious correlations. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in domains such as robotics, with potentially large gaps between the open- and closed-loop performance of an agent. In such settings, causally confused models may appear to perform well according to open-loop metrics during training but fail catastrophically when deployed in the real world. In this paper, we study causal confusion in offline reinforcement learning. We investigate whether selectively sampling appropriate points from a dataset of demonstrations may enable offline reinforcement learning agents to disambiguate the underlying causal mechanisms of the environment, alleviate causal confusion in offline reinforcement learning, and produce a safer model for deployment. To answer this question, we consider a set of tailored offline reinforcement learning datasets that exhibit causal ambiguity and assess the ability of active sampling techniques to reduce causal confusion at evaluation. We provide empirical evidence that uniform and active sampling techniques are able to consistently reduce causal confusion as training progresses and that active sampling is able to do so significantly more efficiently than uniform sampling.

    "abstract": "Code review ensures that a peer engineer manually examines the code before it is integrated and released into production. At Meta, we develop a wide range of software at scale, from social networking to software development infrastructure, such as calendar and meeting tools to continuous integration. We are constantly improving our code review system, and in this work we describe a series of experiments that were conducted across 10's of thousands of engineers and 100's of thousands of reviews. We build upon the recommender that has been in production since 2018, RevRecV1. We found that reviewers were being assigned based on prior authorship of files. We reviewed the literature for successful features and experimented with them with RevRecV2 in production. The most important feature in our new model was the familiarity of the author and reviewer, we saw an overall improvement in accuracy of 14 percentage points. Prior research has shown that reviewer workload is skewed. To balance workload, we divide the reviewer score from RevRecV2 by each candidate reviewers workload. We experimented with multiple types of workload to develop RevRecWL. We find that reranking candidate reviewers by workload often leads to a reviewers with lower workload being selected by authors. The bystander effect can occur when a team of reviewers is assigned the review. We mitigate the bystander effect by randomly assigning one of the recommended reviewers. Having an individual who is responsible for the review, reduces the time take for reviews by -11%. ",

Existing approaches, however, either represent objects as implicit surface functions or neural volumes and still struggle to recover shapes with heterogeneous materials, in particular human skin, hair or clothes. To this aim, we present a new hybrid implicit surface representation to model human shapes. This representation is composed of two surface layers that represent opaque and translucent regions on the clothed human body. We segment different regions automatically using visual cues and learn to reconstruct two signed distance functions (SDFs). We perform surface-based rendering on opaque regions (e.g., body, face, clothes) to preserve high-fidelity surface normals and volume rendering on translucent regions (e.g., hair). Experiments demonstrate that our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on 3D human reconstructions, and also shows competitive performances on other objects. ",

In this article, we comprehensively discuss the diverse threats that age-based systems are vulnerable to. We begin with discussion on densely interconnected networks that employ gossiping between nodes to expedite dissemination of dynamic information in the network, and show how the age-based nature of gossiping renders these networks uniquely susceptible to threats such as timestomping attacks, jamming attacks, and the propagation of misinformation. Later, we survey adversarial works within simpler network settings, specifically in one-hop and two-hop configurations, and delve into adversarial robustness concerning challenges posed by jamming, timestomping, and issues related to privacy leakage. We conclude this article with future directions that aim to address challenges posed by more intelligent adversaries and robustness of networks to them. ",

    "abstract": "Developer turnover is inevitable on software projects and leads to knowledge loss, a reduction in productivity, and an increase in defects. Mitigation strategies to deal with turnover tend to disrupt and increase workloads for developers. In this work, we suggest that through code review recommendation we can distribute knowledge and mitigate turnover while more evenly distributing review workload. We conduct historical analyses to understand the natural concentration of review workload and the degree of knowledge spreading that is inherent in code review. Even though review workload is highly concentrated, we show that code review natural spreads knowledge thereby reducing the files at risk to turnover. Using simulation, we evaluate existing code review recommenders and develop novel recommenders to understand their impact on the level of expertise during review, the workload of reviewers, and the files at risk to turnover. Our simulations use seeded random replacement of reviewers to allow us to compare the reviewer recommenders without the confounding variation of different reviewers being replaced for each recommender. Combining recommenders, we develop the SofiaWL recommender that suggests experts with low active review workload when none of the files under review are known by only one developer. In contrast, when knowledge is concentrated on one developer, it sends the review to other reviewers to spread knowledge. For the projects we study, we are able to globally increase expertise during reviews, +3%, reduce workload concentration, -12%, and reduce the files at risk, -28%. We make our scripts and data available in our replication package.

However, existing feature grids either come with a large memory footprint (dense or factorized grids, trees, and hash tables) or slow performance (index learning and vector quantization). In this paper, we show that a hash table with learned probes has neither disadvantage, resulting in a favorable combination of size and speed. Inference is faster than unprobed hash tables at equal quality while training is only 1.2-2.6x slower, significantly outperforming prior index learning approaches. We arrive at this formulation by casting all feature grids into a common framework: they each correspond to a lookup function that indexes into a table of feature vectors. In this framework, the lookup functions of existing data structures can be combined by simple arithmetic combinations of their indices, resulting in Pareto optimal compression and speed. ",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) encompasses diverse paradigms, including model-based RL, policy-based RL, and value-based RL, each tailored to approximate the model, optimal policy, and optimal value function, respectively. This work investigates the potential hierarchy of representation complexity -- the complexity of functions to be represented -- among these RL paradigms. We first demonstrate that, for a broad class of Markov decision processes (MDPs), the model can be represented by constant-depth circuits with polynomial size or Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with constant layers and polynomial hidden dimension. However, the representation of the optimal policy and optimal value proves to be $\\mathsf{NP}$-complete and unattainable by constant-layer MLPs with polynomial size. This demonstrates a significant representation complexity gap between model-based RL and model-free RL, which includes policy-based RL and value-based RL. To further explore the representation complexity hierarchy between policy-based RL and value-based RL, we introduce another general class of MDPs where both the model and optimal policy can be represented by constant-depth circuits with polynomial size or constant-layer MLPs with polynomial size. In contrast, representing the optimal value is $\\mathsf{P}$-complete and intractable via a constant-layer MLP with polynomial hidden dimension. This accentuates the intricate representation complexity associated with value-based RL compared to policy-based RL. In summary, we unveil a potential representation complexity hierarchy within RL -- representing the model emerges as the easiest task, followed by the optimal policy, while representing the optimal value function presents the most intricate challenge.

The timely and precise identification of tomato leaf diseases is crucial for successfully implementing disease management strategies. This paper introduces a transformer-based model called TomFormer for the purpose of tomato leaf disease detection. The paper's primary contributions include the following: Firstly, we present a novel approach for detecting tomato leaf diseases by employing a fusion model that combines a visual transformer and a convolutional neural network. Secondly, we aim to apply our proposed methodology to the Hello Stretch robot to achieve real-time diagnosis of tomato leaf diseases. Thirdly, we assessed our method by comparing it to models like YOLOS, DETR, ViT, and Swin, demonstrating its ability to achieve state-of-the-art outcomes. For the purpose of the experiment, we used three datasets of tomato leaf diseases, namely KUTomaDATA, PlantDoc, and PlanVillage, where KUTomaDATA is being collected from a greenhouse in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Finally, we present a comprehensive analysis of the performance of our model and thoroughly discuss the limitations inherent in our approach. TomFormer performed well on the KUTomaDATA, PlantDoc, and PlantVillage datasets, with mean average accuracy (mAP) scores of 87%, 81%, and 83%, respectively. The comparative results in terms of mAP demonstrate that our method exhibits robustness, accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. Furthermore, it can be readily adapted to new datasets. We are confident that our work holds the potential to significantly influence the tomato industry by effectively mitigating crop losses and enhancing crop yields. ",

    "abstract": "Environment shifts and conflicts present significant challenges for learning-based sound event localization and detection (SELD) methods. SELD systems, when trained in particular acoustic settings, often show restricted generalization capabilities for diverse acoustic environments. Furthermore, it is notably costly to obtain annotated samples for spatial sound events. Deploying a SELD system in a new environment requires extensive time for re-training and fine-tuning. To overcome these challenges, we propose environment-adaptive Meta-SELD, designed for efficient adaptation to new environments using minimal data. Our method specifically utilizes computationally synthesized spatial data and employs Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) on a pre-trained, environment-independent model. The method then utilizes fast adaptation to unseen real-world environments using limited samples from the respective environments. Inspired by the Learning-to-Forget approach, we introduce the concept of selective memory as a strategy for resolving conflicts across environments. This approach involves selectively memorizing target-environment-relevant information and adapting to the new environments through the selective attenuation of model parameters. In addition, we introduce environment representations to characterize different acoustic settings, enhancing the adaptability of our attenuation approach to various environments. We evaluate our proposed method on the development set of the Sony-TAU Realistic Spatial Soundscapes 2023 (STARSS23) dataset and computationally synthesized scenes. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to conventional supervised learning methods, particularly in localization. ",

Traditional histopathological diagnosis poses challenges in this context. In this study, we introduce a novel polarization and radiomics feature fusion network, which combines polarization features obtained from Mueller matrix images of liver pathological samples with radiomics features derived from corresponding pathological images to classify HCC and ICC. Our fusion network integrates a two-tier fusion approach, comprising early feature-level fusion and late classification-level fusion. By harnessing the strengths of polarization imaging techniques and image feature-based machine learning, our proposed fusion network significantly enhances classification accuracy. Notably, even at reduced imaging resolutions, the fusion network maintains robust performance due to the additional information provided by polarization features, which may not align with human visual perception. Our experimental results underscore the potential of this fusion network as a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis of HCC and ICC, showcasing the benefits and prospects of integrating polarization imaging techniques into the current image-intensive digital pathological diagnosis. We aim to contribute this innovative approach to top-tier journals, offering fresh insights and valuable tools in the fields of medical imaging and cancer diagnosis.

Particularly, we design a subproblem to address infeasibility issues in the master problem. Accordingly, two types of cuts are added to the master problem for ensuring algorithm feasibility and solution optimality. ",

    "abstract": "Deep neural network approximation of nonlinear operators, commonly referred to as DeepONet, has so far proven capable of approximating PDE backstepping designs in which a single Goursat-form PDE governs a single feedback gain function. In boundary control of coupled PDEs, coupled Goursat-form PDEs govern two or more gain kernels - a PDE structure unaddressed thus far with DeepONet. In this note we open the subject of approximating systems of gain kernel PDEs for hyperbolic PDE plants by considering a simple counter-convecting $2\\times 2$ coupled system in whose control a $2\\times 2$ Goursat form kernel PDE system arises. Such a coupled kernel PDE problem arises in several canonical $2\\times 2$ hyperbolic PDE problems: oil drilling, Saint-Venant model of shallow water waves, and Aw-Rascle model of stop-and-go instability in congested traffic flow. In this paper, we establish the continuity of the mapping from (a total of five) plant PDE functional coefficients to the kernel PDE solutions, prove the existence of an arbitrarily close DeepONet approximation to the kernel PDEs, and establish that the DeepONet-approximated gains guarantee stabilization when replacing the exact backstepping gain kernels. The DeepONet operator speeds the computation of the controller gains by multiple orders of magnitude and its theoretically proven stabilizing capability is illustrated by simulations. ",

    "title": "Emergence and Causality in Complex Systems: A Survey on Causal Emergence  and Related Quantitative Studies",
    "abstract": "Emergence and causality are two fundamental concepts for understanding complex systems. They are interconnected. On one hand, emergence refers to the phenomenon where macroscopic properties cannot be solely attributed to the cause of individual properties. On the other hand, causality can exhibit emergence, meaning that new causal laws may arise as we increase the level of abstraction. Causal emergence theory aims to bridge these two concepts and even employs measures of causality to quantify emergence. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in quantitative theories and applications of causal emergence. Two key problems are addressed: quantifying causal emergence and identifying it in data. Addressing the latter requires the use of machine learning techniques, thus establishing a connection between causal emergence and artificial intelligence. We highlighted that the architectures used for identifying causal emergence are shared by causal representation learning, causal model abstraction, and world model-based reinforcement learning. Consequently, progress in any of these areas can benefit the others. Potential applications and future perspectives are also discussed in the final section of the review. ",

The number of CNOT gates in our circuit is estimated by $O(2^{n+2h+1})$ , when trivial circuit decomposition techniques give $O(4^{|X|+n+h+2})$ CNOT gates, where $n$ is the number of trees in a random forest model, $h$ is a tree height and $|X|$ is the length of attributes of an input object $X$.

    "abstract": "Multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers complementary diagnostic information, but some modalities are limited by the long scanning time. To accelerate the whole acquisition process, MRI reconstruction of one modality from highly undersampled k-space data with another fully-sampled reference modality is an efficient solution. However, the misalignment between modalities, which is common in clinic practice, can negatively affect reconstruction quality. Existing deep learning-based methods that account for inter-modality misalignment perform better, but still share two main common limitations: (1) The spatial alignment task is not adaptively integrated with the reconstruction process, resulting in insufficient complementarity between the two tasks; (2) the entire framework has weak interpretability. In this paper, we construct a novel Deep Unfolding Network with Spatial Alignment, termed DUN-SA, to appropriately embed the spatial alignment task into the reconstruction process. Concretely, we derive a novel joint alignment-reconstruction model with a specially designed cross-modal spatial alignment term. By relaxing the model into cross-modal spatial alignment and multi-modal reconstruction tasks, we propose an effective algorithm to solve this model alternatively. Then, we unfold the iterative steps of the proposed algorithm and design corresponding network modules to build DUN-SA with interpretability. Through end-to-end training, we effectively compensate for spatial misalignment using only reconstruction loss, and utilize the progressively aligned reference modality to provide inter-modality prior to improve the reconstruction of the target modality. Comprehensive experiments on three real datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits superior reconstruction performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. ",

However, many studies have focused on improving models in the spatial domain while neglecting the importance of frequency domain information. Therefore, we propose Multi-axis External Weights UNet (MEW-UNet) based on the U-shape architecture by replacing self-attention in ViT with our Multi-axis External Weights block. Specifically, our block performs a Fourier transform on the three axes of the input features and assigns the external weight in the frequency domain, which is generated by our External Weights Generator. Then, an inverse Fourier transform is performed to change the features back to the spatial domain. We evaluate our model on four datasets, including Synapse, ACDC, ISIC17 and ISIC18 datasets, and our approach demonstrates competitive performance, owing to its effective utilization of frequency domain information.

In this work, we approach regularization in neural networks from a probabilistic perspective and show that by viewing parameter-space regularization as specifying an empirical prior distribution over the model parameters, we can derive a probabilistically well-motivated regularization technique that allows explicitly encoding information about desired predictive functions into neural network training. This method -- which we refer to as function-space empirical Bayes (FSEB) -- includes both parameter- and function-space regularization, is mathematically simple, easy to implement, and incurs only minimal computational overhead compared to standard regularization techniques. We evaluate the utility of this regularization technique empirically and demonstrate that the proposed method leads to near-perfect semantic shift detection, highly-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates, successful task adaption from pre-trained models, and improved generalization under covariate shift.

    "abstract": "Reliable predictive uncertainty estimation plays an important role in enabling the deployment of neural networks to safety-critical settings. A popular approach for estimating the predictive uncertainty of neural networks is to define a prior distribution over the network parameters, infer an approximate posterior distribution, and use it to make stochastic predictions. However, explicit inference over neural network parameters makes it difficult to incorporate meaningful prior information about the data-generating process into the model. In this paper, we pursue an alternative approach. Recognizing that the primary object of interest in most settings is the distribution over functions induced by the posterior distribution over neural network parameters, we frame Bayesian inference in neural networks explicitly as inferring a posterior distribution over functions and propose a scalable function-space variational inference method that allows incorporating prior information and results in reliable predictive uncertainty estimates. We show that the proposed method leads to state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation and predictive performance on a range of prediction tasks and demonstrate that it performs well on a challenging safety-critical medical diagnosis task in which reliable uncertainty estimation is essential.

    "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are biologically-inspired models that are capable of processing information in streams of action potentials. However, simulating and training SNNs is computationally expensive due to the need to solve large systems of coupled differential equations. In this paper, we introduce SparseProp, a novel event-based algorithm for simulating and training sparse SNNs. Our algorithm reduces the computational cost of both the forward and backward pass operations from O(N) to O(log(N)) per network spike, thereby enabling numerically exact simulations of large spiking networks and their efficient training using backpropagation through time. By leveraging the sparsity of the network, SparseProp eliminates the need to iterate through all neurons at each spike, employing efficient state updates instead. We demonstrate the efficacy of SparseProp across several classical integrate-and-fire neuron models, including a simulation of a sparse SNN with one million LIF neurons. This results in a speed-up exceeding four orders of magnitude relative to previous event-based implementations. Our work provides an efficient and exact solution for training large-scale spiking neural networks and opens up new possibilities for building more sophisticated brain-inspired models. ",
